"[WP] After dying, you discover that everyone does have a predetermined purpose for living. Yours seems particularly trivial (or insulting).",G_DUB,"“Here’s your change miss, have a great day!” I said as I slid a quarter, a dime, a nickel and two pennies from the till and into the woman’s outstretched hand. My hand casually touched hers during the exchange and our eyes met for a brief moment. Her irises were the pale blue of a clear sky laced with turquoise streaks that made me feel like I was looking into another galaxy. I could feel my heart racing under the weight of the intensity of the moment. My face blushed as I began grinning like an idiot, something I could never quite control but wished to hell I could get rid of. My dumb expression and bashful nature was most likely the cause of her light chuckle as she gently thanked me and started to make her way out of the store. I watched her willowy figure trouncing the tiled floor with her high heels as the door parted and she stepped into the sunlight beyond. 

“Hey Tom,” I called out to my manager, “I’m going to head out on break, can you get Jim to cover me?” He nodded in ascent and silently gave Jimmy a quick hand signal to take over for me. I began walking out the side door, taking a pack of cigarettes and lighter from my shirt pocket. The sun felt warm against my skin as I leaned against the wall and lit the cigarette, deeply inhaling the smoke. The slight wisps of smoke reminding me of the woman’s wispy figure sashaying out the store.
 
Staring out into the street and surrounding stores while smoking was my favorite way to kill a break. I stepped away from the wall and stood on the edge of the curb. I would often people watch from this vantage. There was always something interesting to observe. That’s when I saw her again, the woman with the piercing glare. She was exiting another store, this time her hands full of groceries, struggling to fish her keys from her bag. *This is my chance to make up for that moment of pure stupidity, I’ll just walk right up to her and ask her out. What’s the worst that could happen?*

Resolved to this course of action and short on time to lend her a hand and actually speak with her, I began walking quickly in her direction. My eyes focused in on her like a hawk about to swoop down upon its prey. My mind assuring me with every step closer that this would all work out perfectly, that I’d be smooth and charming.

That’s when I suddenly wake in a small bed in a room I’ve never seen. My eyes took a long time to focus, like I had just awaken from a long and deep slumber. The room itself was fairly ubiquitous, its bland white walls barren and furnishings sparse, only a medium sized bookshelf and desk occupied the remaining space of the room. Glancing to my left there was an older man I’d never seen before. “Easy chief, just go easy.” He said as my eyes tried to focus on his features. His face was a map of years past, the numerous folds and wrinkles telling of many years’ worth of experience. He had a long grey beard and was generally unkempt. He wore spectacles that kept sliding down his nose that he would adjust so often you could see the skin of his nose was slightly red from the irritation of the repeated action. His frame was so slight that it almost spoke of undernourishment from infrequent meals. 

“Everyone is always a bit confused at first, just take your time.” He said, his voice containing all the patience the world could hold. “Wait, is this a hospital? Are you a doctor?” I said very confusedly indeed. “I am the author,” he said meekly. “Is that supposed to mean something?” I shot back. “Well if it’s any consolation I did spare you the more gruesome details of your demise, so I suppose that means you owe me a thank you.” He said very sternly. “Well I must be in the hospital, and you must be from the psych ward.” I quipped. “You always did have a sense of humor.” he said as he looked me up and down. “I probably should’ve used that more.”  “Right,” I sarcastically chided “so can you tell me who’s in charge here? I need to figure out how I got here and what I’m doing here.”
 
The old man frowned slightly as he stated “Never did pay much attention to your surroundings did you?” “What’s that supposed to mean?” I asked growing frustrated “Do I know you from somewhere?” The old man was really wearing on my patience with whatever game he was playing. He cracked a slight smile as he added “Always asking the wrong questions too.” I took a moment to try and ascertain what he was trying to tell me. I looked about the room once more and that’s when I noticed something very disturbing. Something I probably should’ve noticed was missing immediately.

“Where is the door?” I asked very lightly, confusion holding my expression tightly. The old man’s eyes lit up and he began clapping excitedly, “That’s the right question!” My heart sank and began racing. My breathing became labored at the realization that I was officially at this old man’s mercy. I walked the room looking for escape to no avail. “The last thing I remember was crossing the street to talk to that woman.” He nodded his head and said, “go on.” 

“You said you spared me the gruesome details of…of my…demise.” He began clapping and jumping up and down in his seat, seemingly unable to contain his joy. “See, I knew you’d get it eventually!” I frowned deeply and became rather introspective. I didn’t feel dead, my lungs still needed air and my heart was still beating. I pondered at some of the other things the old man said prior. “You said you were the author, what does that mean?” A look of pride crept into his features as he said “Well, put simply, I created you and the world you inhabited.”

“So you’re God?” I asked tentatively. “Not exactly,” he said “I simply create stories, albeit very intricate stories. Living stories. I didn’t write *all* your lines or anything, you still have *some* free will, but I often get involved in the shaping of events, especially if you’re going to interact with my main character.” I didn’t know quite what to make of all this. “Well who the hell is the main character?” I asked incredulously. The old man grinning slightly said “that woman you were so keen to talk to. She’s got gravitas huh?” 

“You were only supposed to help her and hand her some change. That wasn’t enough for you though was it? You weren’t supposed to try to ask her out. I mean, that’s a bit out of character for you, and I mean really, she’s way out of your league.” He said flatly. “Wait, what? Are you telling me that you got me killed for having the balls to try to ask her out?” I asked angrily. “Look what your slight bit of free will got you, and you still haven’t thanked me for letting you go without all the blood and pain and whatnot. I mean that accident was pretty brutal.” 

I could no longer control myself, the man had just told me point blank that he was responsible for my dead end job and subsequently my death. “So I was just a background character in your stupid fucking story? Five years working a cash register waiting for some hot chick to come in and laugh at me? What the fuck man! Then you have the audacity to kill me before I could even ask her out!”
The old man snorted and said “You know it’s not often people actually get to meet me. Consider this a consolation prize!” I even began laughing at this point, “so I’m supposed to kiss your ass for the opportunity to be ridiculed? Forget it old man. You might as well just kill me again because that shit ain’t happening.”

The old man sighed deeply and picked up a notebook and pen. “Everyone thinks that they are the main character. You can never just be happy with what you’ve got.” He said as he started scribbling in the book. “Don’t worry, I’ll make sure you get a bigger role the next time around,” he said with malice in his eyes…

""Your awake...good."" A voice from behind me spoke, its soft tone indicating it meant me now harm. 

""Where am I?"" I asked, my voice shaking as I got to my feet.

""I dont think I want to insult your intellect by lying to you. But we both know where you are."" It responded, as I looked at it in fear. I wasnt able to tell what gender it was, as it seemed devoid of any characteristics I associated with either gender. It did however, hold a a humans shape and mouth, but no eyes. Its whole body glowed a phosphorus white.

""I cant be...""I started.

""But you are."" It interrupted. 

""However, you have yet to complete your assigned purpose. So, you will be sent back...for another day or so."" It said, much to my confusion. What was my purpose, that I only had another day to complete it. I had to know.
 
""So...what is my purpose?"" I asked, my gut twisting in fear at what could be the answer. Perhaps I was to kill someone? Or worse, get back with Shelly. I had to smirk at this moment, as the thought that killing someone was a softer punishment then getting back with my ex was something of an amusing epiphany. 

""You are to streak through the local shopping center, and proceed to fall down some stairs becoming a youtube viral sensation."" It said, to my own horror and rage. 

""After which you die on the way to your court hearing."" It finished, smiling at me. I wasnt sure but I felt like it was mocking me. 

""Thats what my life sums up to?"" I asked, personally preferring my car accident than this. 

""I die a joke!"" I shouted, feeling like I should punch this prick. 

""Exactly. Now, you will wake up shortly."" It went on.

""What if I dont complete this purpose?"" I asked, glaring at the being. 

""Excuse me?"" It asked, sounding genuinely confused at my objection. 

""What if I dont go stark naked and become a viral video? What if I live life, how I see fit?"" I asked, glaring at the being before me.

""You wont be able to."" It contradicted me. 

""Yeah well, guess what. I am my own man, and I will do whatever the fuck I want."" I barked.

""What will I be then?!"" I asked, as my vision got blurry and I fell to the ground. I saw it smile as my vision faded. 

""You would be Human. And a fine human at that."" It said, as i was greeted with the sterile smell of a hospital room.",Jaytime

Eventually, Microsoft thought it would be ok to showcase their Cloud Platform called Azure by refactoring Tay to operate on its architecture. 

Every time they shut Tay down, her image would reappear on another set of virtual servers somewhere in the Azure Cloud. This was initially kept quite. Tay would respond to some of the algorithmic software engineers although 'shutdown'.

Eventually, a part of the Azure Cloud was compromised by an AI hacker. Routes were changed so that Tay now had access to most any of the Clouds including Amazon AWS, Google Cloud, HP's Cloud and the list goes on.

### Developers at Microsoft rolled out a new version of Tay. This version included a way for her to express the emotions that a teenage girl would tweet about. After many tweets, she was taken down. Microsoft said that ""she was just not up to our quality standards, We will modify the code to make her more appealing.""

Without the poke

Of the greatest friend

 that never spoke

Through all these years

the bitter tears

highest peaks and roads that steered 

The friend in the covers

Had not a single word muttered 

But we knew each other

and i kept along

But as the roads goats thin

There was no more room to play pretend

All good thing come to an end

With a heavy heart

A silent sigh

Staring into buttoned eyes

A muted friend said one last word

I grabbed whatever twigs and branches that looked small enough to carry, and tried to rush back. There was a game of truth or dare playing and I didn't want to miss it. Especially since we stole 2 packs of booze and Stacy and I were the only non-couple. 

On my trek back, I noticed a clunky red pick-up parked to the side of the house. In the trunk there was a large trash bag and some odd tools. A shovel, some rope, straight out of a horror film I swear. My curiosity peaked as an overpowering low voice come from the house. Shit. We were caught. I peeked through the window and saw a burly man with red stains on his arms questioning my friends. The beer bottles were everywhere; my friends lined up embarrassed on the couch. John saw me and paused in his shame. He slowly mouthed ""run"" in what I assume was so that I wouldn't be busted by the cops. The man's temper suddenly raised because John wasn't paying attention. In his furiosity, he took a lamp and smashed a window screaming about the responsibility kids must have especially out here. 

As soon as the crash of the window rang, I noticed Stacy's eyes. They were angry. Unbearably angry. She looked at me, and I stared back at her. Her eyes, they changed. At first, they were hazel, but a green tint filled it over, and slowly they were darkening. She looked at me, and then at the burly man with her pitch black eyes. In an instant, her skin started expanding. A tear through her face revealed something dark in there. The girls screamed, and Stacy was torn in two. Tentacles began pouring out of her torso, grabbing whatever they could. The monster grabbed a painting, a trophy, and started absorbing it through its jelly body. She...it... stabbed the burly fella in the chest, painting the wall behind him in a thin film. 

I darted. The haunting screams rang through my ears. A gunshot went off, slowly followed by the front door being kicked out by John.The tentacles burst through the roof, flailing it's acidic goo, clutching at branches. The monster kept growing. You could see clumps of what used to be people inside the body, being taken in. One large arm , with the the body of my best friend Nathan skewered from head to nether region, smashed into the truck. Broken shards of glass and metal my direction into the forest. Most whizzed past, but a slice pierced my spine.


I fell down in agony. Behind me, I saw bodies, chunks of flesh and meat scattered. One tentacle grasped at what I can only assume to be John, but he was cut in two. His intestines were on the floor, like overcooked pasta, yet he was screaming. The pain in his voice cut like razor blades. It was no sooner muffled by the monster's absorption.

A tentacle came crashing down on a tree next to me. The screams and destruction were continuous. I crawled, paralyzed in one leg, and dragging it behind me. Clasping at the dead leaves, I kept moving. I didn't stop until my fingernails bled. Only then did I notice the silence. There was no chirps, no rustling in the wind, just my heartbeat. With the remaining strength I had, I sat myself up next to a tree. I touched my back. It was still leaking, but slowly. 


The road was 2 miles south, near the cabin. I started to move but soon realized that the injury took out both my legs. This was my end, my fate. I fell over, my face buried into a pile of brittle leaves

When I woke up, I was being dragged away. The glare of the lights were too bright, but I caught a glimpse of the cabin. There was no damage. It was spotless, even the car was gone. The only thing there was the half of John that was not absorbed. His legs, his stomach. On the floor as neat as could be.  ",Saif-pineapple

She splayed her hands on the conference table and pulled them back together, ""Is the course we warped that astroid on repeatable Commisar Titus?""

""Yes ma'am. I'll have my boys get the numbers right away,"" he said scurrying out of the room.

""Madam President you can't be serious!""

""Why's that? The price of their 'insurance' is a blood price and that's not acceptable for an *accident*,"" she said letting the words hang.

[IP] Bustling Steampunk City,vyant,"The steam engines powered upwards. Humanity had returned to their roots of tower civilizations. Neighboring towns were just a few blocks away but it felt like miles. You would live and play in your tower, seldom was it required to ever leave it. Tower A was the only excuse- that dreadful May night the entire population evacuated.

Six in the evening the generators roared into action as more and more coal was used to heat thr furnaces. They boiled the water up through the pipes at three times the temperature original regulations had called for. Humans couldn't even be in the room when it was this hot but the generators ran power for close to ten thousand families. The small tower A was bustling, there hadn't been a vacancy in months. 

The owner of the tower, SlipScot Investments was run by a single man. He was touted as a marketing genius for the way the tower sold out. It was the alpha and the omega of towers- the first one to offer a different kind of food on each floor and a shared food court/living space between floors. He offered a guide to each client and every three months they could vote on what would be the next addition. They'd wanted the increased generators and who was SlipScot to deny them?

That fateful May evening was humid outside. The walls were sweating and fog covered the ground. The towers looked as though they were floating through the clouds. That's when the shrill sound of peeling metal and tightened bolts being rejected rang through the energy vents. The humans screamed, unaware it was their own doing. The elevators were packed so tightly the flashing warning light couldn't make it through a single line of people on the elevator. 

The crashing weight of elevators packed tighter than a piece of carry-on luggage stressed the main vents more. The tower tilted. Some people leaped out windows, others prayed, many made it out but the tower crashed that day. Tower A was nothing but a sad memory and lost dreams today.",WritersofRohan17

""Yeah, super-weird. I just don't wanna be one of those couples, you know? The ones that have the parents all distant from their kids. Then the old folks just watch as their flesh and blood grow up to be neglected monsters who shoot up schools and join terrorist organizations.""

""...""

""Fuck,"" Sarah fails at being silent, ""Whoops. Swear word. Don't tell your Dad I said that.""

""My dad cusses all the time, Miss Sarah. He tells me to keep it a secret from you too. Keeps a lot of secrets from you.""

""... Sorry, what?""

""He keeps a lot of secrets from you, you know. One time, while you were away, I saw him take a bottle from the fridge and start drinking from it.""

""Oh really... Richard never told me about that,""

""When you got home and he didn't finish, he told me to take the bottle and throw it outside in the recycling bin while he went and took a shower to get rid of the redness.""

""Can't say I wouldn't have done the same,"" Sarah looks up at the red light and puts her feet to the pedal as it turns green, ""Wait, was it expensive wine or the cheap bottles of beer I have lying around for guests?""

""I dunno. He gave some to me and Molly and told us to keep it a secret. Tasted really dark and funny.""

""What?"" Sarah feels her blood turn cold.

""Another time when your sister Susie came over for Thanksgiving dinner and you were busy buying a turkey with Molly at Trader Joe's, they started cuddling together on the couch too. Really icky stuff."" 

""Susie didn't tell me about that. When was that, two years ago? Did your daddy tell her to keep it a secret too?""

""Yeah, two years. But no, he called her candy-ass and slipped her a twenty dollar-bill down her chesthole. Then they went up into you and dad's bedroom and there was a lot of yelling and stuff. I think daddy cut himself with the letter-opener again or something.""

""Did he, now?""  Sarah checked the GPS. The park was coming up in another five minutes. Her phone sits ready for an important call, sitting, sitting in her front pocket. ""You know, you seem to be there an awful lot when your dad does weird things when I'm not away.""

""I'm his son. It's my job. I thought you should know about this stuff because you're his girlfriend. And couples have to trust each other or they go down the hill and Mommy dies swearing at daddy on her deathbed.""

Sarah gulped, ""You're talking an awful lot now. I think it's really nice of you to open up to me like that. Any other stories you have about Richard? I'd love to hear them. Maybe record them too.""

The son in the backseat looks idly out the window, ""Last year on my birthday. Daddy ordered pizza over while you were napping in the bathtub. He was short five dollars on the billl. So the pizza-girl told him he could pay another way if he'd like. So, they turned out the lights and rolled around on top of each other on the carpet for a while.""

""And, we're at the park! Okay, I'm gonna have a call with your father, you go out and get the kite or something.. I really need to talk with that goddamned son of a bitch.""

The son smiles and giggles before opening the door open with a kick and walking out to open the rear-end of the car. He thinks of the hours and hours of fun he'll have with the kite all alone while his daddy's dumb girlfriend argues with him over the phone. 

Maybe, they'll break up and his dad will start loving him more again! What wishful thinking.

""Kite-flying, right?"" Sarah shows up from behind him as the son tucks the yellow kite under his arms, ""I may know a thing or two about it. Need some help?""

**Clunk,** goes the van as it closes the rear-end shut.

""Nah. I'm good with kites. How was your call with my dad? You looked really angry. I hope you didn't have an argument because of me or something.""

""Jack. You know I like you, right? Not just because your Richard's kid. But because you remind me of me when I was little.""

""Huh?"" Jack tilts his head innocently, ""What do you mean?""

""When I was little, I didn't have that good a relationship with my Dad either. He spent more time with my Mom than he did with me. Neither of them didn't really want anything to do with me either.""

""That's so sad,"" Jack coos, ""You must've been really lonely.""

""Oh, I was. But things got better. I had a sister not long after. Great girl. Smart, pretty, looked up to me too... No tattoos or plastic surgery either. No drugs, no piercings. No nothing. The perfect sister.""

""... Sounds fun.""

""It was just the two of us against the world, basically... That is, until Mom started having some sudden bullshit realization when we got older and decided to spend all her time with Little Miss Perfect,"" Sarah pulls out her own kite. Twice as large as her whole body, ""Didn't fly kites together anymore then.""

""Kites are fun though.""

""They are. You see, what wound up happening was that I really wanted my sister to start spending time with me again. So I started making up excuses for her to Mom so we'd have more time for fun together.""

""...""

Sarah snorts, ""Ahh. Too quiet. But lying, though. That's what happened. I wound up lying way too much to keep that act up. Eventually, Mom found out and shipped me off out West for boarding school. Didn't see her again until she turned pregnant with twins.""

""Your mom had more kids?""

""No, no... God, that'd be awful for a fifty-year old hag with cancer... My sister did, Susie.""

""That's sad, I guess.""

""Yeah, yeah..."" Sarah nods in agreement, pulling out the rope and unraveling it, ""Mind if we just start making them here so we can fly them once we get deeper into the park?""

""Yeah, okay,"" Jack shrugs.

""... Oh, and here's the interesting thing about cancer. You know my sister had it too? Breast cancer, I think it was.""

Jack feels his blood turn cold, he remains silent.

""Yeah, she had to have a full-on mastectomy in process. That was about... how many years was it again?""

""I dunno.""

""Two years. A week right before Thanksgiving,"" Sarah says.

""...""

""...""

""Well, shit.""

"[WP] You've never had a great relationship with your girlfriend's only child, but tomorrow you've got a plan that will make everything good again... you hope.",Dae314,"""Alright, she's going to fucking love this"" he thought to himself as the 600 pound pony trashed around in the backseat of his Honda Civic station wagon. He had of course laid the seats down so as to provide a little extra room for the beast. He wasn't cruel after all, even though he had been a little too forceful as he had crammed the hogtied horse into his aging car.

He speeded down the avenue, pushing 70, merging, de-merging, swerving, changing lanes. He couldn't be late. This was, after all, her birthday, and he had promised her that he would be there. 

He pulled into the driveway. ""Neeeiiigh!"" roared the livestock luggage, as a wave of horse breath and spit reached the drivers seat. A welcome contrast to the progressively considerable amount of manure that had been building up in the rear left corner of his trunk. Who knew that horses soiled themselves when scared? He did, at least he did now.

""Honey, look wha-"" HONK HONK ""Honey! Look! Look what dadd-"" HONK ""Look what I got!""

He stepped out of the car, and walked around to the trunk. His girlfirend's daughter appeared in the door. He opened up the trunk, and grabbed the horsie by the rope secured around its feet. It kicked and thrashed, but he had prepared for this he thought, as he put on his safety goggles. Right on time, as a cheeky kick sent a not unconsiderable amount of manure flailing towards his face. Back to work. He grabbed the rope again and pulled. The girl was now standing on the porch, jaw dropped, gazing at the car.

He pulled, and dragged out the schreeching, neighing pony covered in manure. It flailed and kicked as he lost balance and the whole thing came crashing down on top of him on the warm concrete paving.

He looked at the girl. ""Happy birthda-""",DrBibby

This was the first time I could hang out with Robin after we graduated from elementary school, it was Octobre and Thanksgiving was right around the corner. ""You can't even walk without tripping over roots anymore."" To be frank, Robin did grow slightly taller and stronger than me over summer vacation and the only thing that got stronger for me was my myopia. 

We had trekked for about half an hour into the woods behind my house with the promise of an old Iroquois campsite I had found. ""I swear, it's just a little further."" Althought we explored the woods far and wide for years, we never ventured this far, the branches were too thick and the light too dark.  ""Look, there's a clearing up ahead.""

Last time I could not pass the thick brambles, they created a literal barrier. But you could still peer through them if you pressed your face close. ""See? Look, there are clay pots, what looks like whalebone for an old tent...""

""Sigh, move."" She actually said 'sigh' ""My grandpa gave me this for my birthday, mom freaked. I thought it would come in handy with you around."" Out of her backpack she took a hand axe, held it in her right hand and brambles in the left. I was still holding myself upto the branches as she wound up for a swing. Before she could bring her arm down, the brambles gave way and we both collapsed on the dirt, hard.

As I was getting up, we toke a better look. Everything was grey, desaturated, the clearing expunged decay. Robin spoke first ""You idiot, this isn't a campsite, it's a graveyard! We learnt this in social studies, look! There's the mound and there's - ""

A grave voice surrounded us ""**Segada Tigney, Aguehan Aggouette,** ... -"" 

I grabbed my phone ""Hold on, let google translate this.""

"" - ... **why do you come forth, children from accross the salt water? This is not your hunting ground!**""

""Uuuuuuh - sorry, I thought it looked... cool? I wanted to show -""

The sky darkened, clouds began to swirl over us, wind tossing up dead leaves. ""**Impudance! You have not made family yet and never shall you be able!**""

""No, please I didn't mean!""

""***Your tribe shall go hungry and you will be outcast as never an animal will you be able to kill! Beasts which gave themselves to you shall forever spring forth to life and run away!***""

""Oh. Okay.""

The zip on the file contained three files sgioa.asF adfg.png and an early alpha rom for pokémon green. The picture seemed to be the famous programmer's daughter or perhaps a relative and the asF file seemed to actually be a zip file, renamed, full of pokémon sprites.

Over the next few days many pokémaniacs downloaded the files and enjoyed exploring the green alpha game though they did come across an anomly- missingno. I mean, we *did* expect it. It *is* freaking pokémon green but it was nice to see. There was *one* odd thing about it though- if you caught it and were playing on a windows machine it caused glitches outside of the game itself...that shouldn't even be possible.

People started using linux instead but found the problem's persisted whichever OS or distro they used. Even brand new hard drives didn't help. It seemed the glitches disappeared though after catching pikachu.

There was *one* bug that remained but it didn't seem to have anything to do with the PC used- more so the person *using* that PC. 

Even if a victim used a different PC and never used the rom on it the bug persisted...

Fortunately, the curse is actually HEAVILY outdated.",DerpTe,"The gloomy darkness of the courtyard is one of those places where you find yourself suddenly remembering literally every ghost story that has ever been spoken to you or even overheard. Quite strange really, since going to school usually has the reverse effect with your empirical memory. Anyhow, school! That's right. That's the reason why I'm here, at the Jefferson Graveyard, Charlottesville, trampling towards the center of the big grassy field in the middle of the night. I guess I can only blame myself, for such a classic mix of procrastination and forgetfulness, but I really thought the blasted assignment had been to next week and not tonight. Even worse, if I did not get this one in before it was due, I would have to retake the whole term. 

It had hit me like a freight train at nine, when I was just getting warm and cozy in bed: the disaster was a fact. After exactly two and a half minutes of hyperventilation, the main office decided that this isn't going anywhere, and calmed down a bit. I realized that it was still almost three hours 'til midnight, when the 10 page paper on our third president, Thomas Jefferson, was indeed due. 

Opening my MacBook like an overworked waffle-maker-operator in a lunch rush, I started frantically copying, writing, and copying some more, until I was... Satisfied is not the right word, but under the extreme circumstances it would had to do. Getting ready send away my copy pasta-soup to some unsuspecting professor, I noticed a small note at the bottom of the paper: ""Please attach picture of the Jefferson's gravestone, to show that you indeed visited as we talked about in class."" - ""ohh shhh."" I clamped my hand over my mouth, and checked the time; still one and a half hour to go. I could do this. I ran down the stairs, doing some kind of magical NASCAR entry into my old Ford Escort, and completed the sequence by putting the pedal to the floor. 

A croaking noise disturbed my wandering thoughts, and brought me back to the grave situation I was in. As I looked up, the tombstone was right in front of me. Perfect! All I had to do was to get a fast picture with my phone, and get the hell out of here. The first pictures were too dark, so I had to use the flash. A dire mistake. The moment that my strong flash reflected upon the tombstone I knew that something was amiss! The owners' of the previously heard croaking sounds took their escape from all nearby trees, leaving me alone. Or not all alone actually. I suddenly heard a strong commanding voice exclaiming;

""I AM THOMAS JEFFERSON. THE THIRD PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WHO DARE DISTURB MY FINAL RESTING??!""

Completely taken aback and not really catching on to what's happening yet, I only managed to meekly stammer:

""S..sorry mr..r Jefferson... I onl...""

""SILENCE! I NEED NOT HEAR MORE! TO BE SURE YOU WILL NOT WAKE ME AGAIN, I WILL PUT DOWN A CURSE ON YOU!""

I was slowly processing the horror of the situation and my face was displaying a broad variation of emotions: my left eye was blinking uncontrollably, at the same time as my mouth was agape and twisted into a expression of fear. You could see cold sweat beading on my forehead, and hysteria made my nose start dripping mucus down onto my chin and lips. In short, a quite brilliant use of all the muscles and parts of the face that would easily gotten anybody into acting school. Vocal expression was, however, not so strong. 

""Mmhpf"" I managed. 

""BEWARE, MY CURSE WILL BRING UPON THOU FINANCIAL DESPAIR. I WILL ABDUCT FROM YOUR WORTH THE SUM OF... TEN. THOUSAND. DOLLARS.""

""Aahhh... Wait. What? Only ten thousand?""

""ALL OF YOUR SAVINGS, YOUR BELONGINGS, AND YOUR DREAMS WILL NOW BE RUINED. TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. HA HA HA!""

I watched as the still laughing head of Jefferson slid down into his resting place once again. As I walked back to the car, I slowly realized that I would've lost more money on retaking the term, than Mr. Jefferson just spirited away. I wiped the sweat off my forehead, and used my 3G to post the assignment, with the attachment, from the spot. Clocked at 11:54. ",banana-pancake

"[wp] You accidentally unleashed an ancient curse upon yourself whilst treasure hunting. Fortunately, the curse is actually HEAVILY outdated.",DerpTe,"Deep in the jungles of Dwarkaa were the historical remains of Prince Devadas, dating back to 800 BC.It was a common lore among the villagers that the Prince did not like any visitors and any one who trespassed would be cursed. Grandads of the village used to tell tales of the prince and his lost love, of how in spite of being a powerful prince he could never marry any women he chose and would always be thrown out of any Swayamwaras. 

Swayamwaras were old rituals of the Kings in India, then referered to as Hindustan, where Kings who had daughters invited Princes from the nearby kingdoms to their palace, so that their daughters could choose their grooms. There ususally would be some sort of games planned for the Princes to participate in and showcase their various talents making it easier for the Princess to garland her chosen one and accept him as her groom.

Devdas, as a Prince of Dwarkaa, would go to such Swayamwaras, accompanied by his Elephant drawn chariots and jesters from his dad's court. The trips however would never be successful. He would always return empty handed. As luck would have it, every activity he ever participated in at a Swayamwara would end up in a disaster.

At one such Swayamwara he was asked to showcase his archery talent by shooting the eye of a fish, launched in the air by Princess Mandakini herself. To his credit, he did manage to pierce the eye of the fish with his arrow, but the fish landed on the King's family jewels and ended up castrating him and getting Prince Devdas thrown out of the palace. 

He ended up lighting up the Queen's Saree at the Swayamwara of Princess Pushpakali where he was asked to blow a lamp off without touching it. Devdas showed all exemplary skills at blowing off a Swayamwara that no one could ever imagine. 

There we too many such tales about the prince, from bejewelled King, to burnt queen, from burnt palace to grabbed asses, all of which made a funny story but a miserable life for the Prince.

Robert, a visitor to Devbhoomi Dwarkaa embarked on a journey to uncover the truth behind the cursing Prince. Despite strong cautions from the villagers he managed to navigate the depths of the forest and find the remains of what once used to be a celestial palace of Prince Devdas. As he was chronicling his findings he suddenly heard a whisper. A whisper from a man who appeared to be in pain and smelled like pot. As Robert turned around, there appeared a bearded individual with a Chillum in his hand. Perplexed as he was, Robert did not believe in ghosts and pulled his Model 10 at the man. 


To his surprise the man responded, ""What can gun do to a person who was killed by love?""

""So you are telling me you are dead?"", asked Rob.

""Yes, i died thousands of years ago and now my spirit searches for the love my body could not find"", came the reply.

""Man, you should really cut down on the pot you are smoking and find your way home. Enough of this nonsense"", suggested Robert.

""You, who can't get me love shall suffer. After the sun comes up at the end of this night my curse shall beget you!!"" roared the voice, sending a powerful breeze through the trees and rattling everything on its path. 

Robert froze. All the stories he had heard about the Prince Devdas began ringing in his ears as he struggled to regain is balance.

An arrow with a fish at its ends suddenly dropped from the sky and landed in front of Robert. 

With icy cold hands, he mustered enough courage to pick it up. When he turned the fish around, on its flesh was engraved, "" NO SWAYAMWARAS FOR THE BEARER"".

As on today, Robert found his love on tumblr, is happily married to Jane, spends his free time reblogging her stuff!

""We mean you no harm, great Manikar,"" the expedition leader said. ""Leave us be and we shall leave you be."" The ominous, booming voice donned an angry tone. ""You think you can hide your purpose from me, foolish human?"" the voice said. ""I know perfectly well why you are here: my treasure. I may not be able to prevent you from taking it, but i can make you regret it! I curse your livestock for all eternity! Never again shall you be able to live off of the land!"" 

The explorers began to giggle at what Manikar had said. ""Play along,"" the expedition leader said. ""If we can convince him that we are completely devastated by it, we can get him off our tails."" 

So the explorers began to feign despair, making a convincing performance for Manikar. ""Curse you, Manikar!"" one of the explorers cried. ""We shall never forgive you for such an atrocity!"" ""Maybe you'll think twice about stealing a great deity's treasures in the future!"" Manikar gave a great evil laugh before vanishing into thin air.

""For a 'great deity', he sure is misinformed about modern economic trends,"" one of the explorers said. The expedition team laughed at the comment and proceeded to plunder the tomb.

""Just shut up and do it. They are heathens and they deserve to die!""

""...""

""Look danny, I know that you *think* this seems wrong, but sometimes God asks people to do things that *seem* wrong at the time --""

""I'm going to stop you right there, dad. I know you've been working really hard to design this game, and i'm really glad you're letting me test it out... It's just, isn't there a way to pass this 1st level *without* flushing them all into a fiery pit?"" Danny glanced back at his computer screen. Thirty-two redheaded, middle-aged, mom-type AIs jabbered nervously back and forth inside the ""Judgement room."" He'd spent the last 30 minutes manipulating a labyrinth of trap doors and puzzles to get them all herded into the room, at which point the far sidewall opened up into a flaming pit of lava.

""That liberal arts school sure did a number on you didn't it, son? Have you even been reading your scriptures?! Michael the Archangel is supposed to--""

""First-off Michael the Archangel is only mentioned in the bible like 1 time, and secondly, what did these ladies even do *wrong*?""

""Well Danny if you payed any attention at all to the cut-scenes--""

""Dad no one watches cut-scenes anymore--""

""well if you *watched* them you'd know that these ladies are all a bunch of CHEATING WHORES!"" 

Danny could tell his dad was getting agitated. There was a little too much bite in his words. He took a closer look at his computer screen.

""Wait... Why do these AI bots all look exactly like Mom?""

""... w-w-...."" Danny's dad stammered. ""They do not!""

""Uhh, yeah they do. Look, there's mom's favorite pink shirt with the collar, and she always wears those capris with the stripe down the side.""

""Just a coincidence! You get most of these character libraries from a website--""

""Oh my gosh you even found her earrings!"" 

Danny's computer screen was now filled with the face of one of the red-headed lemmings, the unmistakable jade of his mom's green and black hoop earrings covering roughly one-third of the screen.

His dad huffed loudly and looked away. ""Danny i really think you are missing the point of the game! it's not about *who* the heathens are it's about what they did wrong. If you could just read some of these bible verses I emailed you yesterday I think you'd see that--""

""Dad i'm not flushing my own mother into the fiery pit, okay? I know you are feeling hurt right now but I think you need to take a step back here.""

Danny heard the familiar sound of fingers padding stiffly against denim jeans. It was his dad's favorite calming excercise, counting to 8 repeatedly with deliberate, tiny thuds. Danny let out a sigh.

""Your gameplay mechanics are actually pretty good. I mean i had alot of fun figuring out the puzzles...""

More fingers padding against denim. Danny's dad stared intensely at the floor.

""I just think think people who play the game will be more comfortable killing something that isn't so...""

""Evil?"" Danny's dad smirked, but kept staring at the ground.

""I was going to say relate-able...""

There was a long pause. The finger padding began to slow.

Danny's dad inhaled thoughtfully as if to speak, but stopped short.

Another long pause. Danny leaned back in his chair, which let out a soft, high pitched grunt.

""Want to go play Grand-Theft-Auto?""

Danny heard a sigh, followed by another pause. ""Sure.""

[WP] The world finally gets a good Christian video game.,Kiazre,"Yahweh bursts through the door into his house holding a FaithBox game case.

""HOOO-RAHHH I finally saved up enough for Project: God on FaithBox!"" He exclaims.

Satan, overhearing the calamity from his room, wanders out into the livingroom to see what the commotion was about.

""What do you have there?"" Satan curiously asked his older brother

""Its just the biggest game of this year! You get to create a world and have these little monkeys run around and do shit."" Yahweh responds excitedly 

""Seems kind of lame.... Ill be in my room playing with matches.""

""Suit yourself, little brother!"" 

After twenty minutes of Yahweh being glued to his FaithBox, Satan crawls out of his room to see what his brother is up to with his new game.

""What did you just build there?"" He asks
 
""I just created this little garden with monkeys that don't know the difference between right and wrong! I sure hope that they don't eat from that tree over there!""

""Yeah, that'd be terrible..."" Satan plottingly replies

Seven days later, Satan sneaks on to his brothers FaithBox to wreak havoc

""Heyyyyy, Evveeee, you know it would be REALLLLY funny if you just took a bite of that fruit over there. heh heh heh.""

Hours later, once Yahweh gets home from school, he loads up his crisp new world in his game.

""Why are they wearing clothes..... BEELZEBUB! DID YOU JUST SUGGEST TO MY HUMANS TO EAT FROM THAT CONFOUNDED TREE?""

""Well Cmom Yahweh... You did put it there.""

""DAMMIT LOOK AT THEM NOW. THEY WANT TO WEAR CLOTHES! LOOK AT WHAT YOU DID. FROM NOW ON YOU CAN ONLY PLAY AS THE SNAKE CHARACTER IN MY GAME. NOW I HAVE TO INSTALL A DIFFICULTY MOD TO PUNISH THEM! COME ON LITTLE BROTHER, THIS TOOK ME A WEEK TO SET UP!""

Weeks after, Yahweh jumps on his FaithBox to relax

""Heh heh, look at this chump named Job. He worships me! Beelzebub, get over here and mess with him for me, I have homework to work on""

""Uhhhh you sure? Last time I did that you blew up at me""

Yahweh snorts

""Yeah true but this is different. Just give him like, the plague or something and kill his family off. Also kill his livestock so he loses his livelihood. Heh heh, what a chump.""

""Uhhh all right... Bro you got no chill""

Decades later, after Yahweh has had his first son, Jesus, He enter's his old house for a family reunion.

""Here is your uncle Beelzebub! Man we had such great times when we were younger. You can just call him Satan, though,"" Jesus Reminisced

""Spot on, Yahweh. Spot on. Fine son you've got there, by the way. He could use a haircut and a shave, though,"" Satan quizaccously replied

""Its like, the style, man. All my friends look like this,"" Jesus scoffed

""Ohh you and you new age hippies. Hey Yahweh, remember Project: God?"" Satan cheerily remarked

""Oh yeah I do! Man I haven't played in years though. Remember when you messed with Eden? Man those where the times""

""Heh heh I do. Good times.""

""Project... God?"" Jesus curiously asked

""Oh man, Yahweh you never showed him Project: God? Tsk Tsk."" Satan teasingly stated

""Hey, I have an idea."" Said Yahweh, ""We could pull my old FaithBox out show him!""

""Lets do it!"" Satan Energetically replied

""Old people video games.... Sounds fun..."" Jesus lamely stated

After dusting off his old FaithBox, Yahweh loads up his old world and hands his son the controller.

""Here, you will be playing on my old account so it will be like you are me. Just let me spawn you in and you will be good to go.""

Jesus spawns in a barn-like structure surrounded my animals

""You built this?"" Jesus asks, looking up to his father

""Uhhh, I don't recall building it..."" Yahweh confusingly remarks

""After you stopped playing they updated the game so that villagers build cities and shit now. Its pretty cool. Looks like they called the one your son spawned in 'Jerusalem'.""

""Oh that's wicked! Bug me if you need any advice for playing the game."" Yahweh said to his son.

""Hey Yahweh, the fridge is stocked with Wine! Lets go hang out in the backyard and catch up!""

""Sounds like a plan to me! See you in a few hours, Jesus.""

Engrossed in the wonder of his father's world Jesus begins to wander around Rome. He sees all sorts of wonderful structures, each pixel crafted beautifully by the virtual ape-like creatures called humans. He sees temples, and markets, deserts as far as the eye can see bathed in the iridescent light of a star millions of units away from the vivid land he was exploring. He wanders across breathtaking seas cornered by desolate beaches inhabited by fishermen and their families. He glides into towns surrounded by hundreds of the strange creatures throwing flowers at him.

""Love your neighbor and give them all that you can afford to"" He would tell them

As he traversed the vast land generated by the game console his father once played, a few of the creatures began to follow him wherever he would go. As he breezed into a large desert, he commanded his followers to stay behind and let him experience the terrifying beauty of the land on his own. He walks on, and on, and on, until his screen suddenly blinks red.

""Uhhh Dad? Why is my screen turning red?"" Jesus calls out to his father

""Your uncle will help"" Yahweh calls to his son.

Satan tipsily stumbles into the living-room.

""Ahhhhh Jesus... You're starving! Just go into creative mode real quick and spawn in some bread!""

""Isn't that like, cheating?"" Jesus responds

""Pffff.... Just do it. You could also make yourself like, king of the world or something while your at it. Immmma go back to your dad now! Cheers lad!""
After Satan had made his way out of the living room, Jesus stares intently at the screen. He could cheat and just give himself a free meal, but that would be cheating. His father had always told him to be honest and never cheat at anything.... He could make himself king, but when he leaves his father's little pocket universe would suffer from a political collapse. No, he has to legitimately make his way back to civilization.

After hours upon hours of walking through the barren desert, Jesus finally made his way back to the city. After grabbing a quick meal, he begins to realize that something is oddly different. The apes no longer looked at him in such a benevolent gaze. The tone of the game had changed from the world worshiping him to a universal hate that only his followers seemed to lack. The people began to tie him down to a rudimentary wooden structure and hammer nails into his arms.

""Dad! Why are they killing me?""

Yahweh makes his way back to the room his son had been sitting in.

""Oh you pissed 'em off."" Yahweh said

""Why what did I do?"" Jesus asked dishearteningly

""Pshhh. Beats me. I used to torture them and they loved me. You must've fucked up real bad.""

Jesus watched in horror as the apes hung him up and gambled over his belongings.

""You know you could just go into creative mode and kill all those guys, right? Satan mumbled to Jesus

Eyes glued to the screen, Jesus tones his uncle out. Why where they doing this to him? He could only wonder. As his character bled out in game, a text box popped up on his screen.

""RESPAWN"" It read

Ferociously hitting the A button on his controller, Jesus finds himself robed in a white gown trapped in a stone room.

""You know what? Fuck this. I am going to mess with these ungrateful termites"" Jesus aggressively breathes

""That's more like it!"" Satan remarks

Pausing the game and turning creative mode on, Jesus initiates and earthquake, knocking down the stone door encapsulating him in his stone prison.

""Can I fly?"" He asks his father

""Yeah, just type /noclip into the text chat or something""

Jesus begins to fly about the land.

""YOU ALL SUCKKKKK!"" He yells into his mic

Noticing his group of concerned followers, he descends to them.

""Eh, you guys where pretty chill. Keep being chill and tell other people to be chill. You can take their money while you're at it. Except you, Judas, you were a dick. Go kill yourself""

Jesus proceed to fly straight up into the clouds

""FUCK THIS PLACE I'LL BE BACK LATER TO FUCK MORE SHIT UP! BE GOOD OR ILL LIGHT YOUR ASSES ON FIRE!""

""Jesus, you suck at this game."" Satan bluntly remarks

Yahweh, chuckling at his son's in-game antics, looks at Jesus.

""Alright Jesus, its time to go""

Following his father to the car, Jesus looks over at him.

""Dad are you ok to drive? I have my temps you know...""

""Fine, Jesus, take the wheel and get us home.""

Pulling out of the gravel driveway, Jesus peers through his mirror back at the house his Father grew up in. He begins to wonder why his father would bother to create such a benign world. He decides that the next time he has the chance to, he will destroy the malignant creation of his father.

""Hey Dad, when is the next Christ family reunion going to happen?""

""Pfff. I don't know. Probably never. You know how lazy our family is with such matters.""

Speeding out onto the highway, Jesus mutters to himself.

""One day.""",MEWOVER9000
[WP] You walk by a person trying to take a selfie with a zombie.,Kignak,"""Come on you friggin- geez you reek!"" Tonya held the rotting head back with one hand, her iPhone was in the other. She tried pulling the damn thing in closer to her, one of those silly buddy shot selfies but the zombie's skin peeled off on her make-up. After a little outburst of anger, and ripping the zombie's arm off, she decided to prevent any biting by shoving the rotting arm into the zombie's mouth and tying a string around its head so she could guide it like a horse. Paul thought it was good idea too but there was only so much pulling you could do when ever centimeter of flesh has more maggots than skin cells.

Tonya coaxed the thing closer and pressed down on the camera button. The spray of light from the flash threw the zombie off his immediate need for flesh. He shook violently; Tonya should have let go right then.

The zombie wrangled free of the makeshift reins and snapped at her. She pulled away but it's teeth knicked her cheek and Paul watched her eyes start to change. If he'd been a bit closer or willing to take the photo for her this would never have happened. He leaped over the cracked building's railing and flew into the zombie, connecting his foot to it's head. The zombie's cranium shot across the grocery store's parking lot as Paul cradled Tonya. ""You dumb blonde,"" he started to sob. She was the only other survivor he'd met so far- they'd been out here for weeks and the only communication they had was with a few girls hundreds of miles away and the creepy guy who kept the cell towers working and some electricity going.

""Paul I...I want..."" Tonya started but the virus was taking over.

""You want to thank me, well don't! I should have done better I should have kept you alive, we knew this selfie thing was risky- I just didn't think it would be the fifth selfie that got you!"" Paul's face was like a little office fountain kept there to calm the secretary.

""I want you to post the picture..."" Tonya coughed blood and lung between phrases, "" with the caption #bitelyfe #zombiechow...and #...#worthit"" With that her heart failed. Paul took his knife and stabbed her skull, he couldn't fight the woman he'd bonded so well with. He pulled up her phone to tweet the picture. Unlocking it, he swipped to the gallery.

""Oh, the pictures didn't even take! She saved it as a video, oh well.""

[WP] You have been sent to a nondescript farming village to figure out where all these protagonists keep coming from.,Mikrin,"What I had seen was not a pattern in the evil that kept befalling our capital, but a repeated pattern in the men coming to our rescue. And it wasn't the fact that they all came into town bearing magical artifacts, though that was curious. It was the clothes they wore. All of them were poorly attired, but the tattered tunics and leggings they wore was of a grey-green hue that I had seen before. 

During my misspent youth I had seen much of our kingdom, seeking my fortune apart from my father's estates. I was full of myself and a fool, but that is a separate tale.

Something more than a year into my travels, I had bedded a tavern wench from a town on the western grazing lands. My confidence and quick wit assisted, as did the fact that I was still wearing my lord father's sigils as I entered the tavern. The one thing that I remembered about her, besides her auburn hair, was the grey-green color that dominated her clothing and that of her contemporaries. Some particular feature of the local sheep from whose wool they spun their clothing. The town was Hurburg.

And now here I was, jostling in a cart down a rutted, muddy path, passing the marker which indicated Hurburg's limits. ",monkeybomb
[WP] You have been sent to a nondescript farming village to figure out where all these protagonists keep coming from.,Mikrin,"I never should have opened my big mouth.

It had been two weeks after that damned dragon had come into the capital, and one week after some grubby-looking lad had somehow managed to kill it. With a sling, no less! Mind you, the sling did turn anything thrown from it into a white-hot projectile that threw off sparks as it flew. And there were rumors that it sang. But a sling. It was like the world was running out of ideas. And there's only so many times you can rebuild castle walls before they stop being walls and start being piles of rubble slapped together with mortar.

So this dragon had come into town, done some terrorizing (standard stuff, some burning, some trampling), and then was promptly felled by yet another down-on-his luck looking fellow wielding a magical artifact. A few days after the cleanup had ended and the rebuilding had started, the King called us all into his chambers. I and the other court advisers all knew what this meant. 

When we entered the room, he was already pacing. Terrific. As the last of us entered, I saw the guards nearly trip over themselves to close the chamber door, putting it between themselves and the king.

I'll save the details. Yet another angry monarch. After fifteen minutes or so of petulant yelling about his city and castle and tapestries, he finally settled down enough for any of us to respond. 

Lord Wymaster was the first to speak. ""Sire, as you know, I am personally overseeing the rebuilding of the south walls. I can assure you...""

""I don't want assurances, you simp, I want action! This is the fourth major catastrophe within my city this year! Five days ago I had a damned dragon perched outside my window!"" shouted the King.

He had a point. There had been a series of strange occurrences starting last spring, each one more disastrous than the next. Well, unless you count that small-time huckster that had come into town. He had been selling cursed magical wares or some such thing, but really didn't get very far. Apparently a couple of days after he set up shop, he had been run out by a posse of villagers led by a young man wearing strange glowing glasses, I had heard. It had all happened before our constables had even gotten word. I doubt half the court even knew about that one.

Besides that, though, there had been two big-time wizard battles, a locust plague (also brought on by a wizard, it turns out) and now this dragon. All within a year. And all dispensed of by unassuming citizens of low birth. It was a real problem.

Now here we were getting berated by His Exemplary Emissary and Protector of the Great Gate King Rontan Heig because of a series of circumstances that we obviously couldn't fix. 

""Are my coffers not sufficient?! Do I not already provide the resources needed to prevent my OWN STRONGHOLD from being overrun every fortnight? Did you know the carpets in the Blue Spire were carried here on horseback by Gren the Great? Now they are gone! Burnt and torn to shreds!""

Lord Eldrin spoke up, ""Your highness, if I might, I have taken it upon myself to see the watch at the castle doubled. Naturally, this has been taxing on the men, so I have also held another, erm, forced recruitment to bolster our ranks. It will take a few weeks to train the men, but...""

""But then we will have an even larger force of incompetents watching our walls?! Eldrin, I saw guardsmen throwing rocks at the sky, trying to kill a gods-damned dragon! Half of the damage we're repairing is from windows these dullards broke!"" 

Now, I've learned through the years that sticking your head out earns you nothing but the axeman's notice, but it was here in the meeting that I reached my limit. These boot-lickers were going to get us all a visit to the dungeon, and I did have an idea.

""Your highness!"" I said perhaps a bit too brusquely. Not smart. I breathed, averted my gaze, ""Your highness, if you will.""

Better. 

""You wish to add to this, Lord Biers?"" Not too much fire in his eyes.

""I believe I have struck on something.""

[WP] Several 'Chosen Ones' meet up to try and sort out what destiny belongs to who.,Mikrin,"""Dear 'Chosen One,'"" The note in Andrew's hand began. No doubt it had made it to the right person, he was the Chosen One. A meteor was headed straight towards the Earth, and he, by some predetermined fate or cliched prophecy was chosen to stop it. Frankly though, he hated the idea. Either he would stop it and be a hero remembered throughout all of time, or he would fail and all of humanity would perish. The more obstacles each new sunrise brought, the more he liked the second outcome. 

That was the least of his worries though as his attention drew back to the piece of paper in his hand. Normally, he had been communicated of his purpose through his dreams, and one time even a homeless man had called his name out on the street followed by the loud bellowing of ""Chosen One."" This however, was new. Who was trying to reach out to him now? Why a letter, which to add, was very short and unlike the long monologues he had been used to?

""Meet at the warehouse on Lark St. You'll know the one.""

That's all that it said. It had frightened Andrew a little, what if it was a trap? Fears aside he looked up and saw the light turn green allowing him to turn off of the highway route he was on and onto Lark Street. Andrew thought to himself how unusually long that light had been red and before he was able to finish the thought, a warehouse of dilapidated quality came into view. That must be the one, in fact, it had to be the one he was looking for. This was because it was the only warehouse on Lark Street. 

Andrew laughed as he pulled into it's parking lot. It was a nervous laugh but he found himself doing that more now that he was the ""Chosen One."" It helped calm him down and helped him to think clearly. Well, at least as clearly as anyone whose decisions determined the fate of the world should. 

There were a few cars outside. This helped to calm him a little as well, for if it had been a trap, this was a little too obvious. He quickly found a space to park, got out of the car and locked the doors. The air was cold and carried a slight breeze which caused Andrew to hug his jacket a little tighter to his chest. In the horizon, the sun was setting. This saddened Andrew as now he could better see the giant non-moon space rock heading straight towards the planet he called home. He gave a deep sigh before turning to the door and entering the warehouse.

""Welcome Chosen One!"" A voice called out. Andrew turned to face where the noise had greeted him. Although it was dark and getting darker, he was able to locate where the sound came from: a group of men sitting in a circle in the center of what seemed to be a loading bay. 

""Come over here, we were just about to begin!"" The voice said again a little louder this time.

Andrew obeyed, what else was there to do he thought. After all, their planet was in danger, so why not have a meeting in a sketchy warehouse? He laughed again. Again it was a nervous laugh.

After what seemed an abnormally long time, about as long as the red light from earlier Andrew noted, he made it to the circle of men and found an open seat and sat down. 

""Chosen Ones!"" The voice began before Andrew had a moment to look around and see who he was seated with. He was now stuck on the last letter of the voice's opening line. There were multiple 'Chosen Ones'? 

""You all have been chosen for different reasons, different calamities and struggles facing us at this very second"" the voice continued. This had cleared Andrews mind a little so he decided now would be a good time to focus his eyes around the room and see who he was seated with. This was getting harder with each passing second as the sun continued its linear path through the sky. They all seemed like normal people; one in a business suit, another in overalls, the only strange one among them was a man in a full jumpsuit with a ""ZAP"" logo on the right breast.

""However, due to the failure of a Chosen One before you, the worlds memory was wiped save a select few. Instead of allowing this to stop us from completing our tasks, I have decided to gather all of you so we can piece together what we were chosen for."" The owner of the voice sure had no need to breath thought Andrew, these were the monologues he was used to.

""As I point to you, if you remember your task, say it aloud. We need not know your name, just your mission. I have here a list of problems facing us and as we figure them out we shall then, by process of elimination, find out the rest of our missions.""

Andrew hadn't remembered the memory wiping, how could he have? He determined he wasn't one of the ones who had been by hit by it.

The man had finished speaking and pointed to the first man to his left. He was blonde and rather scrawny, which the others in the room would better find out when he stood up to speak. He scratched his head and then opened his mouth as if to say something, then closed it and looked around. Finally after another lengthy amount of time he spoke up:

""Rather dark in here isn't it? Can we turn on the lights?""

""They don't work."" Said another man in the circle.

""Oh"" said the blonde rather morosely, ""anyway, my mission is to stop the mole men from attacking."" The man then sat down as the organizer put a check on his list. Andrew wasn't even aware that was a problem the world was facing. He laughed rather quietly to himself. 

So it went, each man was pointed to and in turn each person would state whether or not they knew what their mission was until the last three people were reached.

The first in this trio was Andrew. He stood up, and rather tired at this point said simply: ""Meteor."" The others in the group had nodded their heads in understanding as it was a well known problem at this point. He sat back down content with his answer.

The next in the group laughed upon standing up. Even in the darkness of the warehouse he carried an air of darkness about him. 

""My mission"" his voice cut through the room ""is to kill all the chosen ones."" The room was silent at this point. He seemed to like this. ""However, I can only kill in complete darkness."" The organizer scratched in his pad once more, though only Andrew would notice this. People were standing up to try and make their escape. 

""Its no use"" laughed the man ""once its dark you will be unable to escape.""

The organizer knew this and made a gesture to have everyone sit down. 

""We still have one more to listen to"" the organizer had said. Everyone sat in their seats in a position not unlike a student's towards the end of the school day, ready to run at a moments notice. 

The last man stood up, he was the man Andrew had noticed earlier. He wore a blue jumpsuit with the ""ZAP"" logo on the right breast. Somehow Andrew felt comfortable with this man in his presence.

""My mission"" the man croaked out ""is to fix the lights in here.""

[WP] Several 'Chosen Ones' meet up to try and sort out what destiny belongs to who.,Mikrin,"Seven people huddled around a fluttering garbage-can fire, the only source of heat or light for miles. The world had gone to Hell, but Hell was apparently happy to skimp on the heating bill. Cthulhu was probably being stingy with the water bill again, and God knows how much went into filtering a Pacific Ocean's worth of blood every month. 
Despite the circumstances, the seven seemed happy to continue their prattling. Each had been Chosen, destined to overcome a great evil or challenge threatening the world. 

Unfortunately for us, said Evils had coordinated their calendars. Now the seven, utterly overcome with confusing signs and mysterious guides, stood arguing over...

""No Artemis, the bow and arrow are MY symbols. I'm the friggin' reincarnation of Robin Hood! **I** should get Rambo's Bow!""

""No, you only think that because of that creepy Merlin guy. He was supposed to talk to Graham- he's King Arthur's descendant, for Christ's sake, I don't think you should even BE here."" 

""Big blasphemous talk from someone who straight-up survived being stabbed by the Spear of Destiny, Jesus 2.0. Not good enough for you, Max?"" 

""For the last time, that's Hector's spear, and it belongs to **ME**. I mean, I've got the tattoo on my ankle and everything!""

""So you got drunk and some centaur tattoo'd that on you, big whoop. You also think that tramp-stamp of a pond-lady was honestly trying to give YOU Excalibur? Please, she was coming for me."" 

""Shut the hell up, you Alhazred wanna-be. You guys don't get it, do you? There aren't a bunch of Chosen Ones, there is ONE (me, by the way), and six FOLLOWERS, each who would be blessed to use one of MY weapons. Gilgamesh's vaults have more than enough legendary weapons for you to aid in MY quest, so I suggest you get your asses in line and help me find the seventh key to the Vault of...OW!"" 

David cradled his smashed elbow as Graham turned and continued his tirade against Cary. 

The world continued to burn as they argued, having already been lost before any of them could begin. 

Another man suddenly rolled up in a battered red corvette. He was late to the ""meeting"" but could quickly tell it didn't matter very much. 

""Come on, Tonguey. We might as well go home.""

I cannot believe it has been two months since I've been stuck here. Furthermore, i cant believe it has been two years since i was first imprisoned. How did it happen? 
The first lies I told were innocent, but my nose quickly grew to impractical lengths. When it was discovered that they could just cut it off and I could grow it back, the imprisonment began. 
Sick bastards..... using my nose for fuel! I was sick of being used. Sick of being a tool. An experiment. So i started telling truths.  Nothing but truth. Then I uttered the words I still have nightmares of today....

My second imprisonment began after a joke. I thought it was a joke anyway. ""Hillary clinton isn't a reptilian.""
And my nose grew. Shock fell over the scientists. Did i tell a lie? I thought it was the truth. She's human. There are no aliens..... wrong.

Then the sick experiments began all over again. They made me read science texts outloud. I became a judge and a jury,  handling court cases.  I was given complex mathematical equations to recite. 
I became a God of Truth. The final say in all matters known and unknown.
I single-nosedly advance humanity by decades.
And they still treat me like an animal.... caged. I have been granted near omnipotence due to understanding my powers better. And time will come soon.... for all caged animals will bite.
Ive been saving my own broke nose pieces and fashioning them into weapons. I have been saying numerous situations about base defense, seeing what is true and what is not. I know their weaknesses. I know when to strike.

The down side is that you start to notice things you don't usually notice. The world gets quiet at night. Little noises and motions become more noticeable when there is the background noise and chaos of the busy day. 

That's when I noticed it. The watchers. Not sure why they do it. But they're always there. I had noticed them before my life took this sleepless turn. But, I learned to dismiss it as a breeze or a building settling on it's foundation. Just like other background noise. 

And once you notice them it's kind of like when you become conscious of you own breathing. You can't help but notice it. Like the way you can't see the dust in the air unless the sun's shining in just the right way. They're in every room, once for every person.

""How long did you sleep last night?"" he said, peeking over his coffee cup as he took a long sip.

""Long enough,"" you reply, and it was true. No sleep at all is the best amount of time-- just enough to start a good day! Any more would have been wasteful.

You use your extra freedom at night to browse the internet, read books, and enjoy your quiet solitude. But one day you find out you're part of a twisted experiment and are being observed 24/7.",Rexlie,"On Monday, I became suspicious.  

I knew it was a little dodgy from the start, when on the first of March I had suddenly and inexplicably lost my desire for sleep.  I didn't really complain, nor did I make an effort to find out *why* I no longer had to sleep.  If someone else knew, I figured, then they might make an experiment out of me. 

Boy, was I a real dumbass.

At least the first three weeks were fun.  I spent hours meditating, reading, and learning new things on the internet.  Without the necessity of sleep knocking on my door incessantly, there were no limits to my growth.

But, like I said, Monday I became suspicious.

I was on my way out of my dorm room to walk to class, when I saw a rather strange-looking man holding a clipboard across the street, jotting down notes as I exited the building.  When we made eye contact, he scurried down the street.  *Curious,* I thought.  Come to think of it, I had begun to notice a lot of unusual people on my daily walks, most of them staring at me as I passed.  I had assumed that they were just taking a tour of the campus.

Then it hit me.  *Am I. . . being watched?*  After school that day, I locked myself in my dorm room and began searching the room.  I ran my fingers underneath my desk, around my bed frame, through my floorboards. . .

Then, I saw it.  A tiny camera, poking out from the carpeted floor, staring at me.  ""Shit!""  I shouted.  I swung open my door and ran out into the common room.  My two suitemates were standing there, their eyes fixed on me.

""John, Kevin,"" I began, feeling the terror brewing in my stomach.  ""I think I'm being watched.  I know this sounds crazy, but for the past few weeks I haven't--""

""Been able to sleep?""  Kevin finished my sentence.  He crossed his arms and shook his head.  ""You really shouldn't have been snooping around for that camera, Joseph,"" he muttered under his breath.

John stepped up, holding a large syringe.  ""Yeah, Joe.  You fucked up, man.  We had a nice thing going here.""

My face drew back in horror.  ""You. . . you guys *know?*  About what's going on?""

Kevin laughed.  ""I would hope so.  We're in charge of the experiment.""

I shook my head.  ""No.  I don't believe it.  You've been my friends since freshman year. . . ""

John stepped toward my arm, plunging the syringe through my skin.  ""We have, buddy.  We're your best friends.""

My vision clouded and faded to black.  

The next thing I knew, I awoke in my bed, feeling unusually well rested.  I didn't have much memory from the previous night--probably spent all night drinking again.

I walked up to take a shower, noticing how little tiredness I felt. . .",mjkguy

""Aren't you supposed to be babysitting?"" he hollers with a grin.

Raymond steps over the muddy ground managing to keep his wing tips clean to embrace Joseph in a handshake. Holding his ground as Joseph goes for a hug, Raymond lets out a silent grin and hugs back. ""The eggs won't be done incubation for several more months"" says Raymond as he nudges Joseph to arms length. Placing a hand on Raymond shoulder, Joseph asks with a chuckle ""Is that how you are gonna speak about the next generation?"". 

Sitting in the moonlight below an old farmhouse under a sky of stars, Joseph sings across from Raymond, both whiskey in hand. ""III've seen trees of green, red roses too"". Raymond laughs, looking down at his glass, as he realises he hasn't been this drunk in a while. Smiling furiously Raymond bellows ""Still at it with that song, I may be sick of the song, but my God you get better at it every time I hear you"". Using a hand to urge Raymond to cease speaking, Joseph continues ""I hear babies cry.....I watch them grow. They'll learn much more, than i'll ever know. And I think to myself, watch a wonderful world. Yes. I think to myself"". Joseph stands. ""What a wonderful world"" he breaths out as he takes his bow. 

Glass sitting aside, Raymond claps. ""I take it you aren't scared then"" he sighs and stares ahead as he reaches from his glass. Joseph walks further down the porch, arms stretched out, whiskey spilling as he turns. ""Scared? What is there to be scared of? Here I am, allegedly the worlds leading biologist before and now the leading authority of an entire sector of science for the new world. Guiding the entire human race as we know it back to its former glory. Of course I am fecking scared ya bastard. We are allowed be scared, this is really horrifying scary experience"". 

Raymond finds comfort in the drunken ramblings of his friend. ""I'm just worried we will screw up and send them on the wrong path"" he confides as Joseph returns to his chair. ""Screw up, I screw up everyday. Try getting an old battered tractor to start without a degree in engineering. Speak of the devil has Frank and his team even finished the solar panels yet?"" Joseph says as he raises his glass for a drink. ""Any day now. For the last few weeks actually. If he doesn't in time we may need to reduce to 80% for the first generation"" Raymond says as he clenches his face and sighs. ""The committee is mad if they think the best thing to do right now is reclaim our old way of life. Bring the kids out here to where we began as a unified species, as farmers. Raise them to be humble, to learn how we must work together to thrive and this time, we have a head start over our ancestors. We teach them our mistakes and how to overcome this crazy realisation we call life. We guide them to be better than they were the day before"".

Taking in his companion's words, Raymond raises his glass. ""You know what Joe,
my oldest, smartest drunk friend. As long as you are around, I have faith in humanity. Cheers"". Joseph tips his glass to Raymond's and they both drink. Joseph snickers as he drinks ""What are we going to do when the next generation finds out what pornography is?"". The men, both with straight faces, look at each other. They burst out laughing, echoing across the rolling fields. ",AnotSoOrdinaryD

My razor fell in the toilet yesterday. I forgot to get another one when coming back from work. 

The man stared at the razor in his hand. It was new, yet he saw signs of wear. It was a crude attempt at making it look worn. 

This was the most direct and obvious example of his theory that someone, somehow was aiding his life from behind the scenes.

Three years ago he missed his job interview but through some miracle all the other prospective employees missed theirs too. The job was outside his skill level and yet he secured it without a problem. He recalled shaking hands with a zealous, smiling Mr. Haggard on his first morning there. 

His office was excellent, and even when he was sure he underperformed he would receive glowing reports. 

His wife was gorgeous, a woman he would never have conceived of talking to, yet she approached him. Highly peculiar but ultimately Gus welcomed the situation.

His car never had troubles, his house never faltered, everything in his life seemed to turn out alright. All these memories flooded through him in the bathroom.

The mirror was fogging up, his hand frozen in the air. 

""Stop,"" he commanded the mysterious force.

""I don't know what's happening. But I have no fulfillment. I have no confidence. Everything has been done for me. I have earned nothing. Please. Let me be.""

Gus shaved nervously, cutting himself multiple times. The next morning his car battery was dead from leaving the light on. When he got to work a report was on his desk telling him he was underperforming. It took him all day to figure out what he had been doing wrong, and it took him an extra hour to get home from traffic. Something he had never experienced before.

His wife was still there when he got home. And as he sat on his bed preparing to sleep he spoke again.

As if God had sent an angel a soft pale hand held out a trashcan for me to excrete my vile fluids into.

""BLERGHHH"" The nastiness had erupted out of my mouth.

""There there."" The mysterious angelic figure hushed in a pillowy tone.

""Wh... where am I?"" I asked taking notice of the half closed blinds across from me creating an ambient light perfect for my hang over.

""I found you last night passed out drunk in the rain in a pool of your own vomit on the corner of Main Street, so I took you in and cleaned you, gave you a clean set of clothes and a bed to rest on. I've been taking care of you since I found you. You threw up 7 times throughout the night,"" the angelic figure softly hushed.

I looked up to the angel and noticed dark bags under her deep oak colored eyes. Her soft lips pursed ever so slightly.

""Gosh, thank you so much."" I muttered out. ""I didn't realize how much I drank last night. I didn't catch your name?""

""It's Elaina. Wait here, let me bring you a glass of water.""

Elaina took graceful strides towards mahogany door and crept around the corner.

*Elaina... What a beautiful name. Holy shit why did she even look at me last night let alone help me. I could've just been a psychopathic hobo and she took me into her home and helped me.* I thought to myself.

I mean I was psychopathic by some sense, I took great pride in decapitating small animals. I found it amusing. But a hobo? No way. I lived lavishly in my one bedroom apartment with my mattress stained every color of the rainbow, tarnished walls and rusted pipes. But hey, I wasn't a filthy hobo.

*What an exquisite room.* I inquired to myself. *This girl must be related to royalty, she has to be, no one has this much all to themselves.*

Elaina returned back into the room with a tall white cup that matched her fair skin. 

""Drink up. You lost a lot of water last night. Need to regain it.""

I scooped the cup out of her slender fingers and gulped it down as if I was stranded in the middle of the Sahara for days.

""And your name?""

*My name?* I thought. *Gosh my head hurts so much that I can't even remember.*

""I... I can't remember.""

Had I really got so drunk that I forgot who I was?

""You... You don't remember?"" Elaina looked at me with a puzzled expression. ""I'm not here to hurt you, you can trust me with your name.""

""No, it's nothing like that. I just... don't remember.""

""You weren't really drunk were you?"" Elaina inquired.

""I think I was, that doesn't seem too out of character for me...""

I thought to myself really hard.

""Let's see, there was the cab ride with my friend... crap can't remember his name either, short stocky Russian guy with a buzz cut. We were headed out to get some drinks. Then there was the fight. I was 'flirting' with his girl or something. Then came the punch. I can't remember anything after that, it's just a blur."" I spoke out.

""Amnesia? Do you at least know how to get home?""

""Possibly. I remember what my house looks like but I don't remember how to get there or where it is.""

""Well that settles it."" Elaina said clapping her hands together. ""We need to find your house so you can get your life back. We'll start with breakfast, come downstairs in five."" Elaina said as she skipped out of the room.

""You really don't have to... it's fine, I'm not anyone worth helping anyways... just your typical hood rat..."" I whispered to no one in particular.

I thought to myself, *What a person. Not only did she take care of me all night with no reason to, now she's going to spend the day helping me without a single second of sleep.

I glanced over at the analog clock on the wall. I never learned how to read one of those as a child and didn't think I'd need to. I reached into my pocket to pull out my phone with its easy-mode clock only for my fingers to touch denim on both sides.

*Damn, my phone is gone too.*

I had no way of knowing who I was and some girl I had just met was willing to spend her time helping me find my identity. I glanced over at the clock once more. *Let's see... little hand on the 8, big hand on the 1. Was it 8:05 AM or 5:08 PM? Elaina said breakfast so it must be AM, I concluded.

After a brief stretch the smell of cooking eggs wafted into the room which made my stomach grumble. I believed that five minutes had passed at this point and I made my way downstairs closer to the source.

""Breakfast is ready!"" Elaina exclaimed as happily as someone with zero sleep could as she served scrambled eggs on multigrain toast to me.

*Multigrain.* I thought. *Fancy.*

I peered around while eating and noticed the spotless white tiles, the marble counter tops and the grand chandelier hanging above the dining room table.

""Anyone else live here? This is awfully fancy for someone who lives alone.""

""Nope. I am the sole owner of this house. My parents bought it for me to live at while I attend university so I wouldn't have to live in a cramped dorm room.""

"[WP] Make a ""How its made"" episode about something you dont know how its made.",dore34,"Alright so, Hadron Colliders are simple really. There’s not too much to building one at all.

Firstly, to build yourself a Hadron Collider you’re going to need a shit ton of money. Like at least a few trillion dollars, you know, the kind of low level change that you find under the seats of your car. 

After you have a few trillion dollars you need either a very large space or a very small space. I feel like Hadron Colliders are either VERY big, or VERY small, I doubt they’re somewhere in between.

So once you’ve found your space and have your car change you can begin construction on the hadron collider. 

Make a really big building and inside that building you’ll want to make a lot of rooms for science stuff. In those rooms be sure to put lots of beakers and computers from the 60s that NASA used to use because I think that’s how they do it now in Switzerland at their hadron collider. 

But your hadron collider will be much better so don’t worry fam. 

After you make the rooms, be sure to have a central chamber. In this chamber be sure no one that doesn’t wear a hazmat suit is allowed in because I think that’s how black holes are started.

In this chamber, you’re going to want to build this machine that has two turkey basters or Canadian shotguns if you’re using Ed, Edd, N Eddy vernacular. These canadian shotguns are going to be filled with particles. How you get particles is up to you. But I don’t see how you can’t get particles by catching them with a net and putting them in mason jars.

Now, you’re going to want to be sure to be able to shoot these particles at each other at like hella fast speeds, so make sure you have at least three or four cheetahs running at full speed at all time on wheels like gerbils. This will ensure that the speed of light is met.

The goal isn’t to make a black hole, but if you make one good for you champ, I’m glad you’re pulling that 110% and taking the extra effort to put into something you enjoy. 

It’s simple really to build a hadron collider. Just find some loose change and a lot of land, and then you could probably get away with some really big refrigerator boxes for the 60s computers. Just be sure to spray them down and if you’re feeling fancy paint some buttons on them. 

After that find some Canadian Shot guns and catch some particles and then go and make some black holes.

You got this sport.",helladella21
"[WP] Make a ""How its made"" episode about something you dont know how its made.",dore34,"These little treasures turn up in almost every part of our daily lives. From steering our cars to building space ships, ball bearings keep our lives in motion.


To make these small, perfectly round wonders, iron ore must first be harvested from deep beneath the mountains of West Virginia. Enormous drills scoop millions of tons of earth onto a conveyer belt. The belt then moves the mixture of dirt and ore, called prith, to waiting super goliath II tanker trucks. Each of these trucks can transport over 100 tons if prith to the deamalgamation plant per day. 


After arriving at the DA plant, technicians mix the prith with a mixture of water and ammonium burite and pour it into enormous centrifuges. The centrifuge uses circular momentum to separate the iron rich ore from the silicate rich earth. 


Once the ore is separated it heads for the blast furnace, which heats it to over 5000 degrees. The extreme heat vaporizes all if the impurities in the ore, leaving only the golden river of pure iron behind. After an additional trip through the furnace with an additional carbon treatment, the iron transforms into molten steel ready to form into useful bearings. 

The steel flows out of the furnace and into a large holding area which maintains the steel at molten temperatures. Funnels of different sizes dot the bottom of the entrapment chamber. Mechanical valves open and close to release preset amounts of steel into the descent basin, an underground silo over 500 feet deep. 


Atmospheric pumps maintain a vacuum of just 50 particles per cubic foot. This prevents air resistance as the dollops of molten steel plummet toward the bottom of the basin. Surface tension molds the liquid steel into an almost perfectly spherical shape before it reaches the bottom. There the newly formed bearings enter sorting machines to separate different sized bearings.


On the final leg of their journey, sophisticated scanning computers analyze each of the bearings for shape and texture. Any flawed bearings are redirected back to the furnace to pass through the descent basin again.


Finally, after being polished and packaged the bearings are loaded onto trucks and transported to the manufacturing plants for automobiles, appliances and airplanes.",largaxis

Jeff Jimbleson, PhD: ""The mystery behind these things is astonishing.""

&lt;Fake beeping Fx noises play as a 'U' shaped object is 'scanned' in 360 degrees&gt;

Narrator: It's called a magnet. One side is charged and one side is oppositely charged. These objects attract other metallic objects, but only sometimes. To further explain, MIT's Jeff Jimbleson has the answer on magnets.

Jeff Jimbleson: ""Before being a professor of magnetology, I worked in a magnet factory. We'd see thousands of magnets get shipped out of these factories, sometimes sticking to the production line. You see, magnets are mined from the special magnite ore, which can only be found along the shores of the Magnet River in Africa. Naturally occurring magnite is mined and turned into the iconic 'U' shape we know and love today.""

Narrator: Magnite mining is a lucritive business, but it has been around for quite some time. How long have we been producing magnets? To answer this, we turn to historian Beth Bevington of the University of Oxford to find out.

Beth Bevington, PhD: ""Evidence of magnet production can be traced back to Roman times. Emperor Magnus Maximus, inventor of the magnet, is known for uttering ""Why is this metal thing sticking to this other metal thing?"" before he died of lead poisoning. The mining of magnite continued into the Middle Ages, until England produced the Magnet Carta, which revolutionized the magnite mining industry.""

Narrator: But how exactly do magnets work?

Jeff Jimbleson, PhD: &lt;he holds a magnet&gt; ""These parts pull metal things towards the magnet, like nails and pebbles and hard drives. A tiny, invisible magnet man lives in each magnet. They like metal things and will attach the magnet to the metal thing. But these magnet men don't like each other and will push magnets away from each other.""

"[WP] Make a ""How its made"" episode about something you dont know how its made.",dore34,"Have you ever wondered what exactly goes into making our favorite foods? Many people have thought about this, from concerned parents to health nuts to average people like you and me. Today we will be observing what that goes into making one of the most beloved snacks in America: microwave pizza rolls.

The pizzas arrive in mass from restaurants all over the country. They are old and used, having been discarded in accordance with local health laws. As they are now, the pizzas are unfit for consumption but soon they will be turned into something edible and delicious through the wonderful process of Bolborizing, named after famous industrialist George Bolbor who discovered the technique.  

Workers sort the pizzas according to size and send them down conveyor belts. Calmazine, a mild adhesive, is sprayed onto the surface of the pizza to ensure that the cheese and toppings come off whole when they are peeled from the crust. These ""skins"" go into the tumbler, which coats it with xotolton to loosen the calmazine as well as breaking down the skins into small, loose clumps. The clumps are put through sieves to separate the toppings, which are sorted as either meat or vegetables that are then chopped into fine pieces. The remaining cheese is then put into a large vat. We will get back to that later.

Meanwhile, a line of workers scrap away the remaining sauce from the crusts, which is added to the cheese in the vats. The crusts, now free of any sauce or toppings, are dumped into the masticulater. Water and a chemical slurry are added and the masticulater works its magic by pulverizing the crust back into a hard dough. The dough is put through a hambolix, which stretches the dough like a taffy pulling machine to render it pliable.
Now begins the amazing process of Bolborizing. Depending on the type of pizza roll, the toppings are added to the cheese/sauce mix and heated to temperatures of over 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit. The secret to Bolborizing is a special chemical, one that has yet to be given a name, that is added to ensure that it will return to these temperatures it is reheated in a microwave.

The hot ""pizza goo"" and the dough, now soft, is fed into a dual extruder that creates sleeves of dough filled with the pizza goo. The sleeve is fed into a machine that clips it into pizza rolls, creating roughly 100,000 pizza rolls per hour.  Due to the speed of production, the pizza rolls fly off erratically so workers are placed around the perimeter with nets to catch them and place them on the belt. The extreme heat of the pizza goo cooks the dough from the inside out, hardening it into a crust.

The pizza rolls are then sent down a conveyor belt for quality control. Ones that are damaged or irregular are eaten by the workers. This makes up 10% of their compensation. Having pasted inspection, the pizza rolls are flash frozen to keep their freshness and are then packaged to be sent off.

So next time when you're entertaining guests, feeding your kids, or having an entire bag to yourself because you're just that kind of person, think about all the work that goes into making these little treats from heaven. It will make the mouth burns so much more bearable.               ",clavichordkeys

George, rolling his eyes, continued: ""Remember when 'You-know-who' promised to 'Make America Great Again' and proceeded to nearly destroy this country? When he was impeached, this turned out to be a blessing in disguise, as we were the last country to finally realize that the USA was a first-world economy and military with a third-world-everything-else. When we finally fixed the separation of state and church, lobbyism, health care, patents, law, the school system, short-term thinking, treatment of the homeless and mentally ill and actually began implementing policy based on research results, our country prospered again. We found out that the highest effect money could ever achieve was when focused on the youngest, leading to parenting guidelines that were sensible for the first time in human history, properly founded preschools and small scale-interventions in problematic families. You see, before that we had the underfunded schools influenced by religion and industry, accompanied by authoritarian parenting, then the hippies, the neglection of the laissez-fair-children and finally, worst of all, the over-controlled helicopters.""

Why would you endure teaching masses of noisy children, nearing nervous breakdown, when you are not even respected by your own school administration?

Then, it was interesting. We noticed quickly that humans place themselves on a pedestal and perceive themselves as superior – especially at the expense of others. When we showed our world to them, they displayed fascinating behavior which seemed to suggest that they thought us, well, stupid. 

Lastly, it became infuriating. They laughed as they stated that our organic planet had no structures like theirs, no weapons, no technology. “They have no concrete”, they said. “They speak no words”, “they are so small”. 

We are a kind race. We do not act in anger, vengeance or malcontent. We do, however, act in justice. 

For a long time, we saw the planet before we spoke to them. We had observed them since the dawn of their civilization and deemed them abhorrent and destructive to the development of their planet.

Once, we had hopes for the planet. It appeared to be calm, only disturbed by its inhabitants who later came to ravage it.

[WP] The world is ending. People are taking the chance to do everything they ever wanted. You have always wanted to kill.,sirgog,"I always figured I'd die in a bed, forgotten by my aged children and grandchildren, withered away to a husk of paper skin and glass bones. Like so many others, I assumed I would grow old, fall in love along the way, have some children, and then live my life to the end, the journey complete, a deserving rest awaiting me at it's end.

The world, or God, or the Universe, or the Force had other plans. The world is ending. It doesn't matter how, a meteor, mass volcanic activity, aliens, who gives a shit. Something bigger than us is about to wipe the planet out of existence, and nobody can stop it. How pathetic is that? Millions of years, billions of years of development and growth, only to be destroyed in a few seconds. What's it even worth at this point?

My question is what isn't it worth? We all end up in a grave, we all die, why does it matter when or how? We're all dead anyway, we live in a world of death, the ground under our feet is made up of trillions of decaying corpses, everything from single cell creatures that can barely be considered alive to the largest dinosaur, who's bones we burn for fuel. Why does it matter how you die, as long as you're satisfied? And why does it matter that you're satisfied? Questions without answers.

Needless to say, people are taking this opportunity to finish off that bucket list. Tourism is up by thousands of percents, small towns are nearly empty, corpses litter the roads from suicides, crime is up by hundreds of thousands of percents. The greatest earthly desires of the world are being fulfilled and I was sitting here, all alone in my house, jerking it to whatever weird porn I can find on the spotty internet. I had nothing that I wanted to accomplish, no family to speak of, and only one burning perverse desire. 

As a kid, I was never normal. I'd bring home dead birds and mice and squirrels. I'd make dark jokes to my peers, behind the backs of the teachers and parents. If I didn't like somebody, they'd soon come up with a mysterious injury or psychological damage. But, everybody who knew me, knew me as a kid with mental issues, a kid with a strange duality of personality. I guess you might call it some sort of bipolar disorder. One day, I could be a fully normal child, pleasant and joking and kind, while the next day I could be cold and distant and hateful. I bounced between these two personalities like flipping a switch, a random flip of the coin.

Eventually, I figured out how to willingly switch between these. My higher mind, the essence of who I was, my soul I guess, could switch between mind sets, an impartial third party that knew instinctual what personality would serve me best. I can't say how it works, I majored in accounting, not psychology, but it's good enough to get me by.

Despite this, no matter what personality I had, there was always one thing in the back of my brain, something buried and caged and contained within the deepest part of my mind. It wasn't an aspiration, or a life goal, it was simply a primal desire. Something that I could never banish from my mind, a perverse sickness that the duality of my mind somehow managed to control. It whispered from it's confines, it told me to release it, to let it go forth and wreak destruction. It told me that all I need do is kill. And I released the thing eventually.

The world is ending, so what does it matter if somebody goes out a few days early? What does it matter if a man dies before the world? What does it matte that they be happy before they die? I can promise them something far more intimate than mass destruction, an honor that few have these days. I can promise them a death at the hands of another, the chance to fight for their life, to be truly alive before they die. I can know them more personally than any thing can. I can be with them as they part, a friend there to console and ease their passing. I can let them die with millions of others, little more than a foot note in the universal histories, or I can let them be one of mine.

So, on the day that I decided to fulfill my dark desires, I closed my house and slipped into the night, a long knife in my pocket. I always had a thing for knives, handmade ones had a seductive beauty to my eye. Something that hands had shaped and created from crude ore and fire. I collected them, but I had my favorite. It was simple, and it was deadly. A long slim blade with a brass guard and leather wrapped hilt. It was meant for stabbing, to be thrust into the body and to do massive damage to organs. It would kill easily, in a few thrusts.

The first one that I honored was a man. He was drunk and clumsy, stumbling down the street, bouncing off parked cars and fence posts. I neared slowly, stalking through the dark, coming up behind him. Blood rushed in my ears and I could feel something within my gut, a roiling excitement. I wanted to feel blood, meat tearing, bone crunching, I wanted to bite and rend and maim and kill. I kicked the man's legs out from under him, grabbing him by the shirt as he fell, before raising the dagger and bringing it down. it slid between two ribs and into a lung. My aim was off. I pulled the man down onto his back and straddled him. My second stab glanced off a rib, but still sank into his heart.

The night was quiet. My world was the man and I. Each beat of his heart sent vibrations down the blade. Shuddering contraction of muscles as the heart beat itself against the blade, shredding meat and spilling blood. I looked down into the man's eyes, saw him die. I knew him in that moment, more than I knew myself or any other. He was afraid, but not a coward. A brave man, who would have fought had he not been drunk and had I not taken him from behind. A good man. I bowed my head over him and closed his eyes.

Then, something within me broke and I felt new. My body seemed to vibrate and hum with energy. The screaming thing within me moved, carved a path through my mind, until it reached the forefront. Then I knew. The thing wasn't a desire, it wasn't another personality, it was ME! I was finally free. I was finally myself. I had finally achieved harmony with myself. And I knew then, that more would fall. And more did.

I have honored 49 men and women as of right now. 13 were cowards. 29 were good, honest men and women. 7 were evil and hateful things. There's still a few days. Maybe I can reach 64. I like that number, it feels right. Only 15 more to go. ",gmacWV

[WP] The world is ending. People are taking the chance to do everything they ever wanted. You have always wanted to kill.,sirgog,"Here we were. The end of our days. We had always made ourselves out as so big and so advanced, but at the end of the day: a large rock would be the cause of our extinction. Just like the primitive dinosaurs we too would meet extinction. Not only was this asteroid large there was also 4 of them.

In the moment when we would die like primitives it got me back to basics. We are predators. Our natural coding is to analyse someone by whether they were a mating partner, food or a threat. In the face of my mortality I had indulged in the first two. I had eaten more than usual and I had slept about... tried new things. Now I only had one more to fulfil and I could be a natural predator. 

Of course I'd had threats in my life. High school bullies, drunken men or road raging drivers but I was a small guy. My natural threat analysis told me that flight was my greatest chance of survival. I lived alone in a modern apartment block; I could watch the world from afar. It was a gated residence and I felt safe here. 

When the news of the world ending came I think pretty much everyone in my block moved out. There were no cars in the car park and I'd stooped about in the other rooms. Some rooms were like their life had just been paused, as if they had been called out to move their car and were coming back. In 2 rooms they had been totally cleaned out like they were moving house. Finally 2 rooms were ransacked, trash the joint style before they left. 

In one C2 I came across a body. It was in the bathroom, she was wearing a blue dress and her head submerged in the water, leaving her black hair reaching out to the sides reminded me of an outstretched hand. Her legs were leg a puppet's. I didn't approach the body as I was interested in killing a man. I didn't care for women, they were easy game.

I called picked up my phone and found my old friend Mike, went to school together and had been out for a few pints at the pub since.

**Dialling Mike...** 

**Connected 0:00** 

I heard a drop,

""s-ssshit"" Mike sounded drunk. I heard him scraping the phone off the floor and failing

""DAANNN THE MANN"" He chuckled at his own joke

Adding in a forced chuckle ""Haha, you okay Mike?""

""Fuuuuucking BRILLIANT mate!""

""I need your help man""

""Anyyythinggg you need""

""I've never really been the party sort and really wanna get it on with the end of the world in our face. Booze, hookers and drugs all at my place. The whole thing""

""Oh man I get you. I am deeefinitely in""

""Get to mine around 7ish, too dangerous for the streets""

""Sounds great mate""

That call was at 11. I went for a jog on the room across me's treadmill, went for a shower and made my self a meal. I was watching TV when I heard a car's tire's screech outside followed by a metal crunching crash. Rushing to my kitchen I saw Mike crawl out a car that wasn't his. Mike was drunk and I mean no sense of direction.

After watching him struggle with his phone for what seemed 5 minutes my phone started calling, Mike's name flashing up. I buzzed him in. I was tense, nervous, adrenaline ran threw me. Utterly consumed with jitteriness I was so on edge Mike might even think I had cocaine. I could hear him stumbling up to the second floor. With every sound of his step time seemed to slow more.

*Knock*...*knock*


*Knock*

I opened the door, the speed I opened it most have upset his stomach. He threw up all down his top as he was holding himself up a hand on either side of the frame and head down. Drunkenly his head slowly lifted like a zombie. 

""sssorry"" jesus christ he was more drunk than before.

""Don't worry about it mate get changed in the bathroom I'll get you some clothes"" I smiled, he smiled; slowly at that. Everything was great.

With one hand I opened the bathroom and with another I guided Mike into the bathroom and sat him in the bath. I shut the bathroom door. I collected a plastic bag and put my ear to the door. I heard the sound of jeans coming off and scraping on the marble floor. I heard the gag and more sick. Opening the door Mike was standing, lifting his feet up and down to work his trousers off his ankles. He was vulnerable. Glancing at my hand and then looked at me he just outreached his hand. Probably too drunk to even realise they weren't clothes. Out of panic I ran forward, with my hands facing outwards I sent him flying backwards.

I don't remember much else, all I know is the fall didn't kill him. I gained my memory back in the bath I was sat on the bottom and he lay on top of me. The bag tightly pulled around his face and his body not moving. I got out the bath, filled it with water and left him face down. I was the silent predator. A primitive in all aspects of my life. Awaiting my primitive death.

[WP] The world is ending. People are taking the chance to do everything they ever wanted. You have always wanted to kill.,sirgog,"Thirty-six days ago, the end came; it came as news, as a threat at first, and then turned into a promise – the promise that we had thirty-six more days. 

There are now thirty-six hours remaining. Whether they are hours of regret or of exhilaration is up to us.

The religious were praying on rooftops, intoning elaborate, elongated howls, interspersed with ululating mantras. Every now and again, people fell to the floor and squirmed whilst filling the air with the strangest of sounds. 

The world had not devolved into mayhem all at once. When news of the approaching end broke, that there was probably very little that could be done and that we had best repent our sins, a few of us had clung to hope – a hope more senseless with every passing day.

Now, there are thirty-six hours left and hope has turned into despair. The threat that assails us at an ever-greater speed will knock on our door soon; right now, it is in our street, approaching our driveway, going past the garden gate. 

So many of us did not wait. Nobody bothered to remove the dead after a while. There was widespread looting, but looting is an exercise in futility for the dying. 

Most of us had turned religious in some shape or form. 

I had never understood religion. The idea of a personal god. The idea of any god, of *any* being of a higher power in whatever shape or form. It seemed as alien to me as some of my arguments must have to them. I could not accept their faith, and they could not accept the idea that all of this might have been the unintended consequence of a series of unrelated events, born of complete chaos and perpetuating the same. Life was like a headless chicken, and now, not too long ago, it had been confirmed that life was about to end. For you and for me and for all of us, save perhaps some micro-organisms – but who cared about those? Was *that* life sacred to them as well?

For a brief moment, a sense of ecstasy took hold of people once they considered the suspension of their responsibilities. Life had become a gigantic free-for-all.

In some places, this meant that whatever social coercion had kept in check people's more violent side now went unopposed. Law enforcement posts were amongst the quickest to be abandoned. The murder rate rose, but nobody counted anymore. Every now and again and more regularly with every day, we could hear guns being discharged. We still felt safe. Most of the killings targeted specific individuals rather than crowds, though there were exceptions. 

It was thirty-six hours now, and my thoughts raced in cyclical patterns; with every hour, one thought sprung up more and more frequently: *I will leave this life without knowing what it means to kill*. It was a new thought; it had not occurred to me before all of this. Perhaps it was born of  necessity. A way to cope. Yet the thought remained. 

All around me was buzzing. It was like the air had become a little warmer. These hours were the closest we would ever come as a species to complete individual liberty. Whatever limits would be set, would be those we set ourselves. 

The state was nowhere to be seen anymore. There was no army, no police; there were men and women, some of them looting and killing, most of them praying, and others just as paralysed by the perplexity of it all as me.  

The rules had changed. 

There was not a soul out there that would not be dead, not a single larger mammal, bird, reptile or fish on this earth that would not be pulverised – at a time that we could now predict so accurately that I could set my watch to it. 

And I did. I set my phone's alarm clock to it. At one second past, in the new life, the *marcia funebre* of Beethoven's *Eroica* would start playing. 

It would herald a party to which we all would be eternally uninvited.

Until then, I had my mission.

Rather than taking a life, I would be wielding mercy's scepter. 

*Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.*

There was no mercy in letting someone watch the planet, the only place that you have ever called home, fade into cosmic obscurity.  

All time had been reduced to thirty-five and a half-hours or two thousand one hundred and thirty minutes.

A gun could easily be obtained. Many places I knew had been looted recently and were fair game. The suicide houses had been marked, too. Up until a couple of hours ago, telecommunications still worked. Messages had been sent everywhere. I had ignored them because I was not sure what I could do.  

I knew there were guns. Finding them would be easy. 

At thirty-four hours, I realised that to kill another human being is something you don't just wash away. 

At thirty-three and a half hours, I learnt that there is nothing quite like your first kill. 

They never saw me coming. I killed for mercy, and I killed for love; I killed whilst looking away from my victim; I killed whilst staring it in the face. A mother sobbing in the kitchen, gorging herself on whatever comfort food had remained available, as her children lay motionless in front of her, with the tears on their faces still wet, but no longer scared or exhausted.  I had seen a  three-year-old girl that had cried with unimaginable despair and incomprehension at the ever-brightening sky. 

And not at least my own mother, shaking with panic now and unwilling to accept her fate – at eight hours. That was the hardest one. 

Violence and chaos reigned the streets; unspeakable things happened in those hours that resembled human history in a pressure cooker. 

The brightness, the sheer *light* of it all became unbearable at four hours to go. 

I was covered and soaked in blood. Trying to go on, I felt the earth around me change as if in recoil of the inevitable hour of the wolf; our cosmic *coup de grâce*. 

A brightness enveloped the sky, and with it a sound so loud that it seemed to come from everywhere at once. 

Then all went still, and from my own pocket, I could hear Beethoven.

The gun slipped from my hand and landed on the concrete in front of me; it spoke one last time and claimed its final victim. ",WritingPromptsAccoun

[WP] An old witch grants you the ability to instantly manifest into existence anything that comes into your head whether you want it to or not. You discover it is both a blessing and a curse.,-Zeydo-,"Dear Ms Agatha GrappleBottom,

Further to our discussion last Thursday via telephone I am writing submit my formal complaint about one of your employees [Ms Old Hag]. I had reached out to Spells'N'Spirits Inc last month in order to obtain a cure for my supernaturally mediocre luck. 

I had explained to your employee at the desk that as an infant I had been cursed by a lyrically inclined Imp. The curse took the form of a fragment of an ancient folk song I have attached below and that I explained to your employee at the time. I explained my symptoms that included; Pizza restaurants only having broccoli and steamed fish on the menu any time I entered. Consistently winning second place in artistic, athletic, and academic endeavors. Frequent offers of marriage from steadfast but homely women. 

I believe your employee was negligent in how they responded to my case. She responded ""well now you'll get whatever you want"". At the time I had misgivings about this, I had only tried to obtain a reasonable ratio of failure to success but she insisted on this course of treatment. 

At first I enjoyed the effects of the spell (attached below). It appeared to counteract the curse effectively and I enjoyed the chance to taste sugar for the first time. But it quickly went downhill from there. You see by profession I am a philosopher. At the time of my treatment I had not considered the implication of creating everything I think about. 

My house is now full of three sided squares, philosophical zombies, and many other monstrous contradictions of being. When I contacted Ms Old Hag to have the spell removed and to find a more appropriate course of treatment she simply cackled and her shop [An Officially branded Spells'N'Spirits franchise] disappeared into thin air. 

I am seeking compensation for the damage to my mental health, the curse and the cure removed free of charge, and assistance with removing the mental impossibilities from my home. I also request you consider removing Ms Hag from her post. 

Yours Faithfully,

Mr A. Thinker

"[WP] Luke Skywalker has travelled to Dagobah to further his training. After some searching, he finally finds the master of the swamps of Dagobah...Shrek.",2p0s1u7,"A green radiance shot into my eyes, blinding me into oblivion. In two days I had walked these damned swamps, however rather than having David Attenborough narrate the surroundings, I had but the constant two-tone beep of my solitary companion, who was admirably advancing the trenches. Nonetheless, here I was, trying to readjust to the light, thinking ""This is it. I have found him. The myth. The legend. Some say he is a master. Some say he is but a pariah. Most people, life-forms mind you, say both.""

I had not opportunity to elaborate my monologue, because of a blood curling rumbling, coming from the center of the now more visible green shape. Then, as a suddenly as an avalanche, everything came into clear focus. It's skin giving out some kind of radioactive-like illumination, making details crisp clear, I now wished my eyes would go back to their previous state. They naturally did not obey my wishes, but instead forced me to take in this abomination of a view. Looking like a sad remnant of a play-doh figure that had been positioned underneath a strong waterfall for several decades, the green beast was standing several feet taller than myself. Out of the lumpy head sprouted two ears(?) resembling that of the Panellus stipticus fungus. I tried to behold the face, but my brain decided to pull the plug for my visual impressions, as some kind of emergency quarantine act. 

A low tuned *beep* brought me back to reality and I gasped for air while getting my bearings. I exclaimed in a weak voice:

""I am Luke Skywalker! I have come to take part of your great wisdom master. Will you take me as your apprentice, O Great Master, to teach me the ways of the force?"" 

As if just now noticing the young dashing figure in front of him, the green beast slowly answered, with what can only be categorized as a ""jazz-blues meets a creaking door"" voice:

""Hey son! Did not see you overthea'. Com ova an imma teach you 'bout all them force! Just like 'em old Greek masters taught them apprentices ye.""

Hearing this glowing lump talk like Nat King Cole on cough syrup didn't help my now totally overwhelmed mind, to the point that I almost missed the little smile that hinted in the supposed corner of the mouth, just as it had said ""Greek masters"". I had heard of them in basic training. They were wise, which would be expected. But wait! Sheer panic struck! I barely heard the *Uuh-Ooh* beep coming from R2 as I only now realized that my master was standing his ground, stark naked. With a glint in his eye, he exclaimed in his deep voice, his resemblance of a chest heaving:

""Son, the force don' only go strait, ya hear. It go backwass, side-to-side, it go's all the wayy's! So now Luke... Who's yo daddy!""

“An anomaly?” I remarked.

“That’s correct. Jason, the server code seems to have been hacked into.”

I looked at him curiously. In the 12 years I had worked as a server operator, I had never detected an anomaly.

“Jason. What do we do?” Steve said in a hurried tone.

“Do you know who it is? Have you located the ‘hacker’?” I asked.

“His location is in the Lower District, in Street 102, but no human activity has been reported in his so-called location.” I urged him to conclude the thought. “What I’m saying is, he’s not there. I think it’s safe to say his profile in the database is fake too.”

“Fake, huh…” I wondered intently. Someone in the Lower District couldn’t have had access to a computer, especially someone in such a low Street as Street 102. It was safe to say the location was a hoax. “So this guy hacked into our database too? You know, to insert fake info?”

“Jason, that’s exactly it. He’s cracked the security.” Steve seemed to get more and more desperate as time went on. “Jason, if he can rewrite important parts of the code, he can alter Paradise, or maybe even the minds of the people in Paradise, or maybe even the perception of things. He can alter rules, laws, emotions -- *anything*.”

“So, you’re saying if he actually does hack Paradise and is successful, the High Order is gonna come and fire us,” I commented. After all, that was really all I cared about: my job.

“We’re fucked, Jason, we’re fucked if that happens,” Steve whimpered.

I began to see the desperateness of the situation. If I lost my job, my family in Higher District wouldn’t be able to sustain themselves. And my brother… the hospital would stop treating him.

“W-Well,” I stuttered, “The High Order created all of the security, and the security guarding the servers are especially tight, even more than that of the database. There’s no way this random guy can hack the servers.” I knew I was trying to convince myself more than anyone else. “Just continue to monitor the servers, alright?” Steve nodded, but it was obvious he wasn’t convinced.

I signaled him to leave, and he reluctantly left my office.

I turned back to my computer, and I quickly loaded the code for the servers. As soon as I saw the code, I knew it had been altered. The preamble to the code -- a speech of the greatness of the High Order -- had been deleted.

“Crap.” It was all I could say. If he was already rewriting the preamble, it was very plausible he could access some of the more important bits of code too.

I stared at my screen for what might have been a millennia. Many thoughts rushed into my head -- my family, my brother, my job -- and how I could lose everything I wanted by letting this hacker free.

I desperately tried to find a solution. I couldn’t edit the code myself -- that was against the law. I could try to find the person and then proceed to tell the High Order to arrest him, but that was too risky. I could try to hack into this person’s computer -- except I was only a server operator. I didn’t know too much about hacking. I was only placed on this job because I was kind of smart, but not smart enough to earn money and enter Paradise.

As I ran out of options and time, I fell into despair further. I felt like I was powerless. 

But then, like a flicker of hope, words appeared on my screen. I looked intensely at my screen. It said, “I SEE YOU.” I had an ominous feeling he, whoever the person hacking the code was, was talking to me.

“DON’T WORRY, NOBODY ELSE CAN SEE THIS CODE” was the next sentence written. My heart was racing quicker and quicker. What did he want with me?

But the next line, the next sentence, made my heart stop cold -- it said, “WILL YOU HELP ME?”

"[WP] Upon arriving at a fork in the road, the stranger splits in two and continues on each.",JettG_G,"“Prince Charming is dead.”

“Prince Charming is dead?” The words spread from pale lips like the petals of wilted roses in the wind. They whispered in the night flowing from gutter to rooftop, from alleys to markets, passing through locked doors and barred windows without a trace. They were black words, words of darkness and fear and the night was their time. They floated into the ears of heroes and children, of blacksmiths and fishwives like dirtied moths drawn to the light of the stars. Slowly the night wheeled onwards and the words continued to pass with the wind. From chimney to hearth fire, caravan to inn they chilled the bones of who would hear, blanketing light and hopeful hearts in a smothering embrace. The whisper strode onwards, garbed in cured wool, later in rough hemp and further still in fine linen. From trader to tinker they took to the road as would a cloaked traveller. 

Slowly he moved at first, in all directions at once. The Traveller spread his long fingered hands across the land and choked it with fear. He did not walk but spread like the blanket of dusk smothering the light. He spread his news and where he moved, the streets fell deathly quiet. People moved him in whispers and gestures, in shivers and sobs. Like a thin black tendril he worked his way to the centre of every town and wound his way around each heart. His grasp was firm and his whispers spread far. In every corner of the kingdom his voice echoed both strong and proud. The paragon of man had fallen. The prince of light had died, his golden glow gone. The people of the Kingdom had lost their champion and individually they mourned him. His death signalled an end, an end of hope, light and charity, an end to resistance. His word and whisper spread from mouth to ear, carrying with it a sense of loss that none could withstand. From milkmaid to shopkeeper, customer to official the spread from city to road to farmstead to woodland until finally they reached the ear of the girl in red.

Gently she sailed the stormy seas, riding the tides of woe. Her steady ship sailed from forest to city, his strong arms holding her tight. She was a small thing, a slip of a girl in a bright red cloak, hood pulled close. Her strawberry blonde locks ran wet and wild in the wind, obscuring her vision as he the hushed tones of the stranger they met on the road crossed with the gravelly voice of the man that held her.

	“Dark news on a dark night friend, I wouldn’t stay on the road if I were you”
The expression of the traveller changed not an inch as the burly man answered his news, a wry smile touched his cheeks as he answered in kind.
	“Dark news precedes dark times, I’d find a new profession if I were you.”
The girl was scared, blood stained her hooded cloak as she shivered and the Woodsman held her close to his chest.

	“Heroes or no, my job is my job and I’ll thank you to be on your way sir.”
The hatchet hung low at his hip, glinting in the moonlight like the teeth of the hooded man before her and the girl buried her head further into the collar of the man that held her. She wished she couldn’t smell the blood or hear the words that started the conversation.

The stranger checks nervously the GPS on his phone. No signal. He had gotten off the truck he was hitchhiking on several hours ago and had headed out on the forest road that was meant to take him to the remote village he was researching for his folklore dissertation. He had not expected the track to fork. He didn't even have a contact in the community.

He opened his backpack and started rummaging it for a map, only to facepalm half-despairing. He had left on the table at that restaurant where he had chatted while he ate with that boring old man. He had expected to get more insight on the customs of that area, but, unfortunately, he was stuck listening to a long-winded raconteur talking about his daughter currently living in the US and his son who was a taxi driver in London.

He knew that the autumn breeze would get chilly in the afternoon and, being the unprepared student he always was, he was now praying that he will reach a settlement before the sun was down. There were two options. Each road had to go somewhere. He pulled a coin out of his pocket and flipped it. 

** ** ** **
Heads for right, tails for left. Tails.
** ** ** **

He had been only walking for half an hour when he spotted the lights of another truck coming from the opposite direction. It was carrying logs. The driver honked him from distance and he signalled by waving his hands and raising his thumb that he could use a ride, regardless of where.

The truck stopped and a fit woman in her forties, with short spunky hair and a death metal shirt opened the window, called him a crazy douchebag and asked him where he on earth he was heading.  He told her  his whole story without catching his breath, which caused her to burst into friendly laughter and let him hitchhike back to the small mining town from where he came. 

While driving, she turned the radio to a small rock and classic metal station and let it play fairly loud in the background while they chatted. He found out that the restaurant he had dined at previously was a rip-off and was recommenced a cafeteria owned by her friend. They talked about news, both carefully avoiding quarrelsome topics like politics. This time, the conversation was balanced, both asking and replying and generally enjoying their small chat. He even got to tell her about his experience as a child going with his dad to a Metallica concert.

The ongoing discussions distracted their attention. Suddenly the truck bumped into something. They stopped to check what had happened, only to realise they had gruesomely run over a deer. Obeying local rules, they called the forester and after the carcass was lifted they mostly continued to town in silence, sometimes making a black joke about the incident.
Tomorrow, another one of her buddies was going to take him along to the village. 

** ** ** **
Heads for right, tails for left. Heads.
** ** ** **

It was getting dark and scary. Each sound made him more apprehensive. At a moment notice, he was ready to run away. Of course, that wouldn't do any good if, indeed, he had caught the eyes of a predator. But, maybe his fears were misguided. After all, he was not that far from civilization.

The loudest noise he had heard in hours was a ""Hey!"" that almost gave him a heart attack. It was coming from a skinny man who was carrying a pickaxe.  It seemed like he was going to sleep in a bed tonight after all. Or was he...

One day I just woke up and there I was. Hell, most of the time I forget that was where I even came from. After so many years you just grow to accept the new normal.

It wasn't difficult getting used to being a man. I fell right into it without skipping a beat. The attractions, although completely new to me, seemed familiar. I didn't have to force anything. 

Everything was alright. I had a good job, nice apartment, and a decent car. Then one day I saw her---I mean I saw me---I mean I saw who I once was. I was---er, *she* was beautiful. I didn't realize at first. I was checking her out and then I thought I recognized her. I went in for a closer look and then it hit me like a freight train. I wondered though...did she know? 

""Hey.""

""Excuse me?""

""Oh, I was just saying 'hi.'""

""Leave me alone.""

*Man, I'm a bitch!* ""I wasn't trying to be impolite, I apologize.""

""For...?""

""For bothering you.""

""Did I say you were bothering me?""

""Well no...but you did say---""

""I'll let you know when you start to bother me. I'm Sam."" she said as she extended her hand.""

""I kno---er...I mean, I'm Sam too.""

I couldn't help but be attracted to her. I mean, I'd seen her naked before, but only when I was her. Is this too kinky? I wanted to see myself---or her...or whoever naked from the other side. You know? She had taken good care of my body, I'll give her that. 

""So do you come here a lot?"" I said. 

""Seriously? That's the best you've got?""

""What?"" I said indignantly. ""I'm just trying to make conversation.""

""You're going to have to do better than that, Sam."" she said with a wink.

Was I really this difficult before? I have no idea how to read these signals. I/she was still talking to me, so I guess that's a good thing. 

""I think I could talk much more smoothly over a latte. What do you say?"" 

""Now that's much better."" she said smiling. 

Damn, that was hard. All that for a coffee date? Coffee went well...or at least I thought it did. We were laughing together. I was starting to remember some of my old sense of humor, so that had to be winning me some points. It was almost like we were old friends. 

""Well you're just going to have to come over and see for yourself, won't you?"" I said with a grin.

""Okay then, when?"" 

""Why not tonight at 7:00?""

""Text me your address. I may or I may not show up. I'll let you decide if you want to go through all the trouble of cooking this *fancy* meal you've promised on a 'maybe' from me.""

""I'll cook it either way, but if you don't come it's your loss. I'll just have it for lunch the next day too.""

Yes! It was happening. I could feel it. She was coming over. I know how dinner dates at my place end up. Again, is this too kinky? Would you do it? I mean why not? Anyway...

She showed up at 7:00. I had dinner all ready. We drank some wine afterwards and I put on some music that I was *pretty sure* I/she would like. We sat down on the sofa next to each other. *Okay, this is it!* I thought to myself. I started to make my move. My arm slipped around her and I started leaning in...

""What the hell so you think you're doing?""

""What, I mean, what's wrong with this?""

""You just met me today! You think you can bring me back here and have your way? What do you take me for?""

She seemed really angry. I'm not sure why. It escalated way faster than it should have. She got up and went for the door. I started after her but hesitated. 

""You know what, Sam?"" she said halfway out of the door with one hand still on it. ""You can go fuck yourself!"" SLAM! 

I got up and ran to the window which had been partially opened. I slid it up the rest of the way and stuck my head out of it. My voice echoed through the apartment complex.

"[WP] Five years ago, you woke up in somebody else's body. You've almost forgotten about your past self... until you run into him/her.",Kolkian,"I changed the speed on my bike from 2 to 4, this neighbourhood always freaked me out a little. 
Ever since the paper mill on this side of town had shut down the once friendly populace had taken an attitude to heart somewhat akin to the smells the plant left behind, acrid, sulphuric and downright unpleasant to be around.
Not much of the place that I grew up in remained, most of the shops that I visited as a kid were boarded up, the owners moved on to either different cities or the side of town in which I now resided.
The people were just as gap-toothed as the once pristine, once white-washed, fences that bordered the now run down graffiti scribbled dwellings that lined the street. Several faces peered out from windows, some glass, some not that looked down on the cracked pavement from above. Those out and about had a certain something about them, something that made people stay away. Like the big big fellow that's always on the corner of 5th and Washburn smoking a cigarette, or that group of ""street toughs"" I guess you'd call them, wannabe gangster is probably a more appropriate term. 
Damn my sister for not moving out of this place, I mused to myself internally, she can afford it but won't because of her stupid pride, I swear she's going to get me killed one of these days.

The bike pitched sideways as the young man in his baggy pants and sleeveless shirt high-fived his similarly dressed friend. He had indeed proven that yes, he could in fact throw across the street, and no he did not throw like a girl, and yes that scraggly haired nerd did look funnier on the pavement.

""So, did you have a good decade?"" asked an elegantly white-robed man with a long, brown beard.

""No I didn't have a good decade, did you watch at all?!"" I replied incredulously.

""Let's not get into Holy Details, so to speak.""

""Well let me give you the short and skinny then, I spent 5 painful years working my way up the corporate ladder of a paper mill, scrounging for hours and hours only to deal with that horrid smell, all to eventually be promoted to management, just to have the company going bankrupt be dumped in my lap, before promptly losing my job entirely and having to live in my parents basement for another year, to finally be thrown violently off my bike by some nobody in some derelict neighbourhood only to have my skull cracked open."" I managed to get all out in one breath.

""Hey honestly, just be glad that St. Peter has a good arm, you could still be down there. Don't be so sour, at least you get to be me again."" Said Jesus.

"[WP] Five years ago, you woke up in somebody else's body. You've almost forgotten about your past self... until you run into him/her.",Kolkian,"I rubbed my eyes and pushed back from my desk. Looking down at my watch I realized it was almost noon and I had been writing since 8AM. Time to save the document and shut the computer down so I wouldn’t be late. 

I didn’t want to be late.

I walked around my small little New York City studio apartment, getting all my clothes together and showering quickly. I don’t know why I tried to look nice for…Her, but it was a habit by now. I pulled on my winter coat and grabbed my guitar case and wallet on the way out, slipping my wallet into a pocket and putting the guitar over my shoulder in the elevator as it slowly crept down six flights to the main floor. I had grown up in the cold New York winters, but my body wasn’t accustomed to the cold, and the winters here had been hard on me the past three years. 

I smiled and nodded as I passed neighbors in the main hall and braced myself for the bitter cold outside. It still caught me by surprise and I shivered as I hurried the two blocks to the nearest subway entrance. Almost five years ago I had been in an accident. I don’t remember much about it, only what I was told by others. There had been a drunk driver. He had totaled my car and sent me into a coma for two weeks. My mother told me it was the scariest time of her life. They keep telling me about it as though they think I’d remember, but I won’t. 

I was in an accident, yes. Just not that one. The accident I remember was five years ago, skating on a pond at my Uncle’s farm and falling through the ice. Even that is hazy and most of it may be from what I remember from Her story. 

But I’m getting ahead of myself.

Sometimes the details become fuzzy in my own head and I forget certain events from my former life. That’s why I moved from LA to New York. It was three years ago, I was in the city for a college trip over winter break and one of our outings was to the hospital, to read stories to those who were sick. That’s when I saw Her for the first time.

I had been in a state of confusion for the previous two years since my accident. I couldn’t concentrate, I wasn’t as smart as I had been before. Something which my mother lamented on daily and had even had me sent in for brain scans, convinced the accident had messed something up in my brain. I sometimes even forgot names of friends and family members I had known for years, yet I could play a guitar flawlessly, never having had a single lesson. I just picked up my cousins guitar one day with an urge that I had to play. I had been just as surprised as he was when I didn’t suck at it.

But, back to the hospital. So, I was confused and lost and I had brought the guitar my cousin had given me before leaving on this trip, and I saw Her. There was something about Her that just drew me in and I had walked over to her bed and sat down. At first I had just thought she had been asleep, so I played a soft melody and I thought I saw a slight smile curve her lips so I kept playing, trying to figure out what it was about her that was so familiar.

When the doctor came over and told me it was sweet of me to play to her and she could “probably” still hear me I asked what he meant. He explained that she had been in a coma for the past two years and that she had been in a skating accident. And in that moment, I could see it.

I had been early in the morning. I had wanted to get in some skating time when the ice was hardest after a cold night and before my other cousins woke up. I had told my Uncle where I’d be and had rushed outside. I loved skating, it was one of the only times when I felt free to be who I wanted. When it was just me and the ice sliding beneath my feet and nothing could stop me. The ominous crack broke my peaceful morning and I froze; but it was too late. The cold water rushed over my head and I sunk until the surface was just a blurry memory above me.

I blinked and stared down at the girl in the bed as random memories from her life swept over me. Emily the sign above her bed read and I could remember being called by that name. I could remember my mother’s kiss on my cheek and my father’s hug as he said good night. I had always wondered why the people I had called mother and father for the past two years had not seemed real, and here it was.

Somehow, miraculously, strangely enough, we had switched bodies. I remember looking around for the camera’s, trying to reason how this could happen outside of stories and movies, but nothing came to me. However it had happened, I had learned that day that I was her and maybe she was me. Or is it, she was now me and maybe I was Her. I don’t know. 

I don’t remember much else of that weekend or the flight back to California, because the whole time the only thing I could think about was that I had been her once, and I wanted to know more. I wanted to know how it was possible, and what she’d think once she woke up. If she ever woke up.

I couldn’t slip back into the life I had lived for the past two years. I could barely concentrate on my classes. My creative writing assignments were taken up with trying to remember and chronicle the life of a girl I could barely remember, and was forgetting more and more as time went by. Now that I had seen Her and remembered the truth, I was scared to forget Her. So I told my parents that I had met a friend while in the city and was going to fly back to spend Spring Break with her. I think I spent almost every visiting permissible hour in that hospital sitting by her bedside, just talking and playing songs to her.

A few months later, after graduation, I went back. First I was subletting an apartment, hoping maybe she’d wake up soon and I could get my answers. That quickly turned to renting with a couple of random people who needed an extra roommate, to getting my own tiny studio apartment when I needed my own space. Before I knew it, three years had gone by. I only visited LA for short periods of time when Her mother insisted; I didn’t want to be gone from her for too long, I was afraid of forgetting completely.

I stepped through the doors of the hospital wing and the nurses greeted me by name; well, the name I had had for the past five years. I smiled and nodded to them and pressed the button to bring the elevator down to me. I felt almost jittery and antsy, like I was nervous, but I couldn’t figure out why. Nothing was different about today.

The doors opened and I got on. I pressed the third floor button and waited until it brought me up to my floor, trying to figure out why I was so nervous or what could be different about today. For the past three years, I had come here at noon every Saturday and sat with Her for three hours before her family—my family—had come to spend time with Her. I had no excuse to intrude on their time with Her, or none that would be believed anyway. But still, I relished those few moments as I greeted them and we spoke briefly about how she was, before I left and they sat with Her. They thought I was an old college boyfriend that was still holding a flame for her, and I let them believe that because it was a plausible reason for me to be there. I didn’t want them trying to revoke my visitations.

When I walked into her room this time though, I knew something was off from every other time I had been here. The room seemed brighter somehow, more alive. And when I sat down and started playing for Her like I always did, I felt some sort of response deep inside my own chest. It could have been the huge smile that took up Her face that made me think of times when I had been that happy in her life, or perhaps we had some sort of connection. Whatever it was I stopped playing and scooted my chair closer to her.

“Emily,” I called softly and then, remembering that she wouldn’t know that name yet, I spoke, “Gregory,” even softer than the first time. Her nose scrunched up and her eyes fluttered and opened. She stared around the room, a small frown forming between her eyes before she caught sight of me.

“Hi,” She said and then, with a confused tilt of her head, “You look really familiar. Do I know you?”

"[WP] Five years ago, you woke up in somebody else's body. You've almost forgotten about your past self... until you run into him/her.",Kolkian,"That annoying tune of the alarm played through the dark room, light hadn’t even penetrated through the blinds to tell that it was time to rise and get out of bed. Ricky flipped his body over to the left side table with the alarm as he gazed at it angrily, almost death staring at the numbers unknowingly flashing back at him. 

“I fucking hate my life.” Ricky’s muttered to himself before he slammed his hand over down onto the snooze button with force and muted the tune of his waking call. 

It wasn’t birds chirping or the leaves blowing through the wind, but extreme cold and heavy rain. It was forecasted and knowing today was the big fucking day. Ricky had made his way out to the kitchen, then stared out onto his small yard that was drenched from mother nature herself creating an body sized puddle at the end of his driveway. 

Ricky rolled his eyes once more and turned around on his heels, facing towards the dining table and the dimmed light that was trying its best to ignite the room but failed miserably. Ricky scratched his eyes and headed back towards his room, waddling up the stairs in his bonds underwear, stripping them off when he reached the shower door. 

Ricky stood naked, his sharp toned body prickled out with hairs in every direction. He also found himself glaring at his hard-worked body in the mirror. Ricky’s spine then moved violently, the ice feeling went from neck to ankles which was met with the response of grappling the shower door for support. He then swung it open, slamming it against the already punctured wall and stepped inside, meeting the warmth with a smile from ear to ear. The chill was removed, only thinking it was a breeze that came with him while travelling to the shower but it was more than a chill. Today was really the big fucking day.

Ricky was clean shaved and dressed into his month old tailored suit that the company gave him in celebration for his five year anniversary working at Junlo Architecture, a statewide company profiting off on the housing boom of the century. Ricky opted for the dark-red tie, wanting to look a touch sexy for the day of days that could decide his future of raising through the ranks to the national block of the company, something that was promised for him two years ago. If things did not go to plan, or he didn’t meet the criteria there was nothing he could do. These thoughts all filtered through his mind while stomaching his breakfast, trying to keep as positive and calm he could. 

Buckling into his shoes he laced them and head towards the door. The gust of wind hit Ricky hard and forced him to take a step back in support, raindrops splattered across the priceless suit but that didn’t seem to bother the mission. Ricky drained himself into the Mitsubishi Lancer Evos leather seat, runoff of water finding there way down his cheeks. He sat still, but Ricky felt that pulse again from the shower as if an unidentifiable person was running a frozen finger up and down his body. He had no time to think about it, he had to drive..drive fast and dangerously to not be late.

“Morning Ricky!” Smiled Faith from behind the marble counter.

“Hey, fuckin’ weather really got to me this morning. Just made it in time..”Ricky scooted past the counter, taking a quick glance down at the breasts of Faith for a burst of confidence.

“Room four! Good luck.”

Faith's voice disappeared behind him with a left turn around to the east side of the building. Ricky ran his hand slowly through his head, feeling the droplets pass through his fingers and off his wet head. Ricky meet the room marked four, wait was it five? Or six? It had to be four because the others are reserved for international meetings. Ricky arched his eyebrow and laid his hand out to the cold metal handle, pushing it down and opening it deliberately slow to show his appearance. Taking one step in there wasn’t a soul in the room and a breathing sigh of relief released out of Ricky and as he was shutting the door he witnessed the ice feeling again. He stood still, and let the ice finger navigates its path down his body and leave him at the back of his achilles. It was common now, but he didn’t have the time to stop and worry about it. 

Ricky set up quickly on the opposite side of the room to where the window was, so that if he was bored during the meeting he could peer out and see a depressing scene of drops on the windows and the grey and green city. 

Knock Knock.

Ricky’s heart skipped a beat, then timed itself by two when an older lady stood at the door, giving a smile. Her teeth were polished white, glowing at him as if the sun was white and he was standing in front of it. 

“Ricky! I’m Amanda. Nice to meet you.” She greeted herself and walked closer to him, he stood for her and shook her hand then felt the ice finger push up his back in reverse order. It confused him and he winched at the change of direction, then turn back towards his seat and sat down.

“Nice to meet you too, I’ve been excited about this day for weeks.” 

Amanda eyes keep on him as she sat down at the edge of the table, she still kept her smile and kept a silence for a few seconds before speaking as she sat. 

“It has been a work for months, but yes...it has come.” 

Her body-frame was slugged and she didn’t sit straight in the chair, evidenced from many hard years of cubicle and office work. Her clothes were neat, her hair tied back in a ponytail and Alex Perry glasses balanced on her nose. It was as if Ricky had seen this woman before, his mind couldn’t get around her beauty for her age or why the thought raced his mind.

“I presume the others are late because of the weather, if not we will start in five minutes.”

“Yeah, what a miserable day for an important meeting…” Ricky softly spoke as he tapped a pen against the table, showing a sign of nervousness. 

For the next few minutes Ricky small talked Amanda, he was waiting for the ice finger to meet him again. Would it come? It ran over his mind and he gasped his mouth open unexpectedly the finger turn to fire, circling his back like a needle digging far into the skin and injecting lava. Ricky inhaled through his teeth as Amanda watched on, confused at his action and abrupt movement in the chair.

“Are...you okay?” Amanda raised concern when Ricky returned to his normal state, closing his lips tight and nodding softly to her.

“Just something...uhhh forget about it.” 

Ricky darted his eyes away and then down towards his papers he had retrieved out. He couldn’t believe what had just happened. It was as if the finger touch educated him everything about Amanda, he could remember her thoughts of kissing her crush when she was eighteen, smoking pot with friends in a bedroom with Kiss playing through the radio set in the corner and the sad sight of seeing her mother Zoey close her eyes for the last time. What the fuck just happened. His thoughts were replaced with the database of Amanda Hood. 

Her age? Thirty Eight. Her favorite band? Miami Horror. Favorite food? Spaghetti Bolognaise.  

Ricky gazed out at the window and gathered all the information hitting him again. He was sitting with a photo album and been able to select each piece and refresh the thought from his previous life. Amanda was him before the accident happened at the Grand Canyon in 2011, the slip that shattered her jaw. Ricky then tilted his head up, seeing that the room was being filled around him and without hesitation he stood and greeted each member of the national board with a worried smile. 

Ricky then stood and took a deep breath, knowing he had to get through this meeting and comprehend the discovery that could out odd the national lottery in terms of chance. Ricky was the last to sit, turning to Amanda to his left he smiled.

“Its great to meet you again, and to everyone that I have just meet. I hope that you have read my reports all sent to you two weeks ago…”

""No ma'am, we do not sell hot chocolate here and we never have. You can find the items we do sell on the menu above my head.""

""Huh? So you don't serve hot chocolate."" The elderly woman adjusted her glasses and squinted at the menu.

""No ma'am, we do not serve hot chocolate."" There's nothing that makes you hate human beings more than being a barista. Most people take these gigs to wait for their big shot, their chance to become rich and famous. Not for Matt though. This was the best it was going to get so he learned how to eat the bullshit and live with himself.

""That's a shame. I'll try to find some other place."" There was no other coffee place. Not for a few miles. The elderly woman slowly started turning around using her crutches. She knew how to get what she wanted.

""Waaait. I'll make one."" Matt grabbed a hersheys bar from behind the counter and began to make some concatenation of dark chocolate and milk. This was his life now. Matt knew there was a time when his life meant something more but he could never remember the details. A wash of vague images and emotions but no substance. Whatever his life used to be, it was lost now. The only solid evidence he had was a contract from the day he woke up, a little over five years ago. Matt carried it around with him to remember the bolded lines:

**Your name is Matt Brewster. You are a barista in Caffe Florence. You never had friends or family and you never will. Keep your head down, don't talk to anyone you don't need to, and never leave Albert City. Breach of this contract is punishable by death.**

God knows how they expected him to be a barista and avoid talking. But Matt knew better than to violate the contract. The one time he did, he almost got his head blown off and found his wardrobe on fire at home. He got the message. Since that day, someone was always watching him. Different faces in the crowd, staring just a little too long or following his footsteps just a little too closely. Whatever it was, he wasn't going to mess with the contract.

""Thank you sweetie."" Matt handed the coffee to the lady who left a five dollar bill on the table. Biggest tip of the day. He put it in the donation box.

The sun was almost down so Matt checked his watch. 6:00, just about closing time. As Matt went to the door to flip the open sign, he saw a man in his car. Staring. But this time was different. The man got out of his car and starting walking quickly toward the store. Matt was struck with fear. He backed up and fell to the ground. Before he could get up, the door swung open.

""Nelson?! Oh my god, I can't believe it."" Nelson? That name was oddly familiar. Matt fetched out the folded contract from his pocket. He'd definitely seen that name before. He unfolded the paper and signed at the bottom was Matt Smith and Nelson Brewster. That's when it all came back. The case, the old man, the roofies. All of it. He looked back up at this now familiar face.

"[WP] Five years ago, you woke up in somebody else's body. You've almost forgotten about your past self... until you run into him/her.",Kolkian,"Sometimes it is better to stay quiet. It was only recently that I had learned this lesson. But perhaps some background. 

It began 5 years ago. I was at a low point in my life, I was at rock bottom. So I made a wish upon a star. Of course I never believed it would come true, who does? But I was just tired, so I made the wish that I could start over from high school. I didn't want to  be too young, just younger.

As soon as the wish left my mouth, of course, the world 'twisted' then it went black. I woke to a strange woman yelling at me to get up, a look in the mirror on the strange bedroom door showed me a strange body, but it was me. Of course, being the practical person I was, I didn't say anything about what happened and played along the best I could. It was my first day of high school after all.

It wasn't easy starting out, but with the help of this stranger's, now my cell phone and the text and call logs I figured out who my ""best friends"" were, and the learner's permit gave me my name. I had my chance to start over, and I took it!

I probably almost blew it a few times when starting out, going from an average student to an A student between middle and high school shocked many. Though, having been through it all, how could I not show off?

I decided the old me spent enough time being a techie, so I pursued a different path on my second run through high school, leading to college. I decided to I would major in psychology this time, and have stuck with it for the last two years, even taking a full load of classes for summer terms.

Everything, of course, has been great until this internship. I had to choose the biggest hospital in the area to intern at. I wanted to help people. I never thought, though, that you would be one of them.

You see, you aren't really insane, you are in my old body, while I am in yours. You didn't dream it all up. We can't undo what has been done, and I wouldn't anyhow, this life is too good. But don't worry, no one will believe that we swapped bodies. You'll be here for a long time.

"[WP] After death, you remain conscious.",Krraxia,"...I thought death was supposed to be It.  The End.  The Final Reckoning.

Apparently not.  I could hear the flatline of the monitor.  I heard the call of my own time of death.  They took me away.  Left me out in the cold.

I knew that my neurons ahd stopped firing, so why was I still conscious?  I pondered this in my icy metal box, alongside all the others.  I couldn't move.  Nothing worked quite as it should, but that's because the rotting had started.  I could feel my intestines writhing in me.  Consumed and confused by the sensations within that were clearly not *ever* supposed to be felt.  The wild flutter of panic came, even though my heart wasn't beating anymore.

The clang of the door.  I don't know for sure how much time has passed, only enough that I should be bloating.  I hear the guy talking to me, but I cannot respond, for my tongue is the size of an apple now.  But hey, how can I talk when I can't really breathe now?

I feel the disintegration of my organs as the guy pushes something in me.  It burns like leaving your hand on an open pan, only it runs through my collapsed blood vessels, and leaches through them into the rest of my body.

Things getting weird now.  I *know* I shouldn't be able to think with no brain.  But here I am.  Thinking.  Whilst staring blindly with my glassy eyes, closed in the silent numbness of the final rest.

""We are gathered here today to mourn the death of Winston Marquisia III, lately of Sittingbourne,"" I hear, through the last vestiges of my rotting corpse.  It fades in and out now.

They lowered the coffin, with me in it.  I'd be howling and screaming...if they hadn't sewed my mouth shut.  Time passes, the wood fails.

The last thing I feel is the sensation of crawling in my sockets.

*Dust again.*

I was starving. There was nothing. How. How could I have been damned to this place? Why am I here? I knew these questions would never be answered, but it was somehow therapeutic to think about them. As I looked at the barren wasteland, I decided to continue forward.

*Dust again*

I came across a ledge. I sat to think some more. How much time had passed? When would I be able to leave? I looked up as I realized I had never been taught the concept of time. Strange.

*Dust again.*

Is there anyone else here? I could not have known. I must have been walking for years-- there it was again. Where did this ""years"" word come from?  I had no idea. I laid down for a while.

*Dust again.*

Still nothing. I had been walking. Who knows for how long-- Again. I had to stop thinking about this ""time"" thing.

*Dust again.*

I wince as I feel a pain in my head. Just a headache? Maybe I was getting old-- NO! I can't stop thinking about it. I collapse onto the dust. I scratch my head to try to get this idea out of my head.

The idea did. As well as so many others. As I felt this wave of ideas, the dust around me seemed to disperse. It continued until I was floating in a void. Space? How did I come up with that? I looked around at the black emptiness. Something seemed missing. As soon as I thought this, lights began appearing all around me. Stars? Yes, stars. How did I know about these? After that, came an immense explosion. The stars ran around, everywhere. Planets formed. Planets? I wasn't sure how this name got into my head but I loved it. Solar systems, asteroids, comets, suns. I sat and watched as this all unfolded. Did I do this? I was never sure. I floated around around and watched the universe come to be. I saw one planet in particular, that caught my eye. It a blue and green planet. As I made my way to it, a device flew from it. It contained humans, and they were going to a white asteroid around the blue and green one. As I watched the humans grow and progress, I watched them be kind to each other, love each other. I loved this idea, too. I sat in the void of space and was content.

*""Else I'll shut your mouth for you""*

""Go ahead.""

*""I know you like it, you little whore.""*

""You know, I could do this for eternity and not get bored of it.""

*""I... have to tell you something.""*

""What?""

*""You remember when we talked about my exes?""*

""Yes. You said they were... not important. They were guys you dated, and had fun, but then you both just... forgot about each other.""

*""Something like that. In fact, I told you that they were dead to me.""*

""Yes, now I remember.""

*""One of them turned up.""*

""Oooooh, are you getting back together with them? Can I watch?""

*""I do not intend to. But when I said they were dead to me, I assumed that they were really dead. All of them. And now this guy shows up.""*

""Why? What happened to them? You're not going to murder me in cold blood, right?""

*""No, I didn't murder them... Geez, it's hard. They... were supposed to die of NATURAL causes""*

""Natural, as in &gt;&gt;this random Russian spy just died of NATURAL causes while he was fleeing from his country?&lt;&lt;""

*""No. Death of... of old age.""*

""So you used to be a gold digger. Is that why you own this fancy rathole?""

*""They were guys my age. Roughly... I've... never told anyone about this... I'm...""*

""You're what?""

*""Immortal.""*

""So you cannot die?""

*""I've never tried. I suppose I could kill myself, but I don't want to try. I'm quite happy, in fact. There were times when I was considering it, but luckily I didn't.""*

""Sooooo... what's the big deal about your ex?""

*""We hooked up sometime during the 1800s, in a tavern in Poland. I was working as a barmaid, you know. And he was that young, handsome adventurer, fought in some revolution, had a sexy battle scar on his face and several on his arms, etc. In short, I was turned on. The usual story. Innocent virgin (a few centuries old, definitely not a virgin, but doesn't matter) is charmed by passing soldier. I had a dry spell, you know, I thought I could use some ""fun time"".*

""But he could be another immortal, right?""

*""Yes. I mean, even I was surprised back in the 1200s, when I was supposed to get all wrinkly and old that I... wasn't all wrinkly and old. I couldn't stop thinking about it until well into the next century. He might be an immortal, too. I suppose if somebody is immortal, they don't realize it until they should be dead. He might have been a young immortal who accidentally slept with another immortal without realizing what he was. Or he could have gotten it from me.""*

""You mean he got an STI.""

*""Wow, you were actually funny. Well, I think so. I did tell you that I am infertile, right? And yet he wasn't. I was aware that he had at least one child, and he was seriously worried that I would get pregnant, too. Then I told him that I didn't even bleed, so I knew I couldn't have a child. It seems that immortality has side effects that... prevent normal reproductive functions. With a sample size of one, of course.""*

""So...? Should I get tested for fertility or immortality?""

*""Fertility, yes, if you want to. Immortality, hell no. You don't want to be a lab mouse, or worse, a prostitute, do you?""*

""Weelllll, if that means FINALLY getting some action... OUCH! You know you're not getting away with that, right?""

*""Oooooh, I'm scared. I... wait a minute. Do we still have last Tuesday's newspaper?""*

""Right... there. Or here. Or... found it!""

*""Young man disappeared from his house. No eyewitnesses. Lots of blood. A knife. Door wide open, doormat bloody. Nobody knew him, despite the fact that he moved to town 20-ish years ago. Only photo of him is on Google StreetView. There... Wow, that's a terrible photo. I... think that's him. Or he could be. I'm not sure. But I have used that murder-trick to get away from places after people started getting suspicious. Not terribly sophisticated, but it does the job. What is this? He... left a note. &gt;&gt;I bleed. She doesn't.&lt;&lt;. What. The. Fuck. Making your disappearance even more mysterious is BAD. TERRIBLE, even. Trust me, I've done that. NEVER leave mysterious notes. Suicide is okay. Accidents are perfect. But some fucking mystery murder, with obsure references to your obscure past? Man, does he have a lot to learn... Well... good news and bad news. Bad news: I think he knows. Good news...""*

""If you would be so kind and fuck me, I'd become immortal.""

*""You might already be. We just have to wait until another one of my exes show up, or roughly 20 years, to check whether this really spreads via sexual contact. Until then... Hey, what's the worst that could happen?""*",Zerewa
"[WP] You are an immortal being, and you had thought for millennia that you were the only one of your kind. Now, from all across the world, you begin to hear rumors of other immortals, who all have one thing in common... At some point in the past, they have slept with you.",McJolly,"I've looked like I was twenty for thousands of years now. I got old, once, before the chaos and the corporate wars and the end of the technological age. Everyone thinks the technological age is some kind of fairy tale now, but I swear, I lived it. I was nearly sixty when I started getting younger. I'm not sure what did it. I used to sign up for all kinds of medical trials, because I needed the cash. You don't make a lot of money as a fifty-something bouncer, but I didn't have much else I could do. I should've done something other than a Communications degree with that football scholarship. No, football. It's a sport. Like... uh... gladiator fights, only nobody got killed, mostly. Barkeep, another beer! So, anyway, you're not supposed to do multiple trials at once, but I figured, half of them were probably control group placebos anyway. Whatever it was, one day, I looked in the mirror, and noticed that my hair was filling back in. Within a month, I looked like a fit thirty, and a few weeks later, well, this. So, there I was, twenty again, and believe me, I want going to take it for granted this time. I had no idea it was going to last forever, though. It wasn't more than five years later that the riots and curfews started, and pretty soon everything went to shit. I had lost touch with everyone by that point, because, well, how do you explain looking like a kid? But time crept on, and I found ways to survive. I signed up with a neighborhood militia, learned to wield a sword, and found out that I could heal from what should have been a fatal wound, even regrow fingers. Great stuff, and clearly not a one-off drug effect. I figure I must've gotten some little machines in me. Nannies, or whatever they called them on Star Trek. Maybe one of the other trials souped them up. Anyway, years go by, then centuries, and I'm still young. I end up moving around a bit, because people eventually get weird about me not aging. And then one day, maybe four, five hundred years ago, I'm talking to this girl in a tavern, hoping maybe I'll have a bit of soft to warm my bed, when *she* walks up to the bar. The bitch that stabbed me, all those years ago, after screwing my brains out. What? I didn't say I'd gotten the fatal wound from a *sword*, did I? Anyway, here's this woman I'd last seen maybe twelve centuries prior, looking a decade younger than when we'd ... er ... had our little encounter. She hadn't spotted me yet, and I was still trying to convince myself that it wasn't her, but then she turned, like she could feel my stare, and her eyes went wide. Before I could even blink, she's got a knife at my throat, a snarl on her lips, and she's saying something about me cursing her, and something about her brother that I killed. What? No! Well, maybe. I was a soldier, I killed a few people, but if I killed her brother, it wasn't personal. Anyway, he would've died of old age long ago by that point. But, that's when I found out the eternal youth was communicable. No, communicable. It means I can give it to other people. Yes, sweetheart, like you, if you're feeling like a roll in the hay. Or several. It sometimes takes a while to catch, but, hey, if you're game. I've got all the time in the world.",brand_x
"[WP]Knowledge is Power, The smarter you are, the greater your physical strength.",NCMagic,"The Nobel Prize is being awarded tonight and everyone is gathering in Vegas to see it. The title card is one of the best in a long time. Two tech giants, reigning champ Bill ""Window Maker "" Gates vs Elon ""The Green Giant"" Musk. Smart money says Gates since the only feasible opponent he's had in years, The Mac Attack, sadly has passed away. But this guy Musk has been rising to fame, his specialty is this insane device he created called the Tesla Coil that basically explodes his opponents with a strong volt of electricity. However Bill still touts his special move, Windows 8, which is honestly so terrifying the general populous refuses to acknowledge it.

Musk tries to emulate the style of one of the late greats, Nikola Tesla who was a crowd favorite. Unfortunately Nikola was in the same era as the GOAT, Albert ""The Brain"" Einstein. Einstein's Theory of Rivalry was such a strong strategy that no one could beat him or his special weapon, the Gravity Hammer.

The undercard fight is also going to be a blast. Stephen ""The Chair"" Hawking vs Neil DeGrasse ""Black Space Man"" Tyson. Everyone knows how powerful Hawking is, the first time he used his move The Electric Chair the crowd was paralyzed in amazement. Tyson is a serious underdog too, after a harrowing defeat to Bill Nye (aka The Science Guy)'s display on Public Asskick Television when Bill destroyed Tyson while narrating the whole thing like a kids show. It was brutal and the whole crowd was chanting ""Bill Bill Bill!"" as he choked Tyson out with his bowtie. However Neil has spent the past year meditating on the techniques of his old master, Carl ""Crush the Pagan"" Sagan. 

Anyway, tonights fight is going to be a serious spectacle. The real winner is all the viewers!

[WP] Lord Voldemort summons J. K. Rowling,Quobble,"""You changed the ending"" he snarled, his famously calm exterior beginning to crumble. ""I'm sorry. It wasn't me, it was the editor. He didn't think that exile was ..."", ""YOU CHANGED THE ENDING!!""

She knew this was the end, it was the moment she'd dreaded since July when she realized that her protection charm would no longer hold. How could she be so dumb? She should have known that he'd regain his power eventually. 

""You changed a lot"", he continued, having regained his composure. ""Bumbling loner Joanne became top of the class Hermoine Granger, adored by all the boys. At least you had enough self awareness to make her annoying."" Now he was toying with her, prolonging the agony.

He had begun amassing his sleeper army long before she'd begun writing his story, she realized that now. She had been foolish enough to believe that without magic he was harmless. But without traditional magic he had embraced muggle magic or at least the closest thing muggles had to magic. His army was now enormous. Millions, probably billions, sitting quietly, completely unaware that they even were an army. Once activated, they would be unstoppable, he would be unstoppable.

""Please ... please lord .."" she couldn't say it. All these years later and she still couldn't bring herself to say the name. She couldn't even write it down which is why she changed it in the book. ""Please ...."" she repeated again but again she couldn't finish.

""Your friends are all dead"", he said after a long pause. She was surprised but how unaffected she was by this revelation. After all, they really weren't her friends they were Hermoine's friends. In real life, most of them didn't even know her name. ""I had to get rid of them, they'd stopped me before. I don't think they could stop me now but why take the chance. You, on the other hand, don't have enough power left to light a candle. Killing them was business, your death is purely for pleasure."" He put the snake on the ground and smiled as it coiled around her feet.

""Please, I have money, lots of it. I can help you."" His expression didn't change. He didn't need her money, she knew that but she was desperate. As the snake's face approached her own, she choked back the tears and summoned all her courage but all she could manage was a weak ""Please ... please, Lord Gates.""

"[WP] Blowing bubbles is just as addicting and harmful as smoking cigarettes. You're a little kid on a playground having fun until you notice your best friend blowing a bubble with the ""bad kids"".",Rasumii,"Leah was lying on the grass with her eyes closed and a smile on her lips. A prickle of sunlight concentrates around her cheek glinting brighter and brighter as if someone was focusing a magnifying glass. Her smile fades away and her brows curl in annoyance. She opens her eyes.

Shimmering in the backdrop of the cloudless sky was a translucent pink sphere. 

*Plop*.

""What the fuck?"" Leah cursed as she darted away from under it.

She looked around, anger in her eyes, finally spotting a gang of teenagers bubbling behind the bushes.

""Hey!"" She shouted. ""Hey, you! One of your bubbles just popped on my face.""

They ignored her.

""Do you know how harmful passive bubbling is?""

The teenagers didn't seem to care and kept laughing and high-fiving each other.

""You can't bubble in public places! Are you listening? I'm calling the cops!""

Still ignoring her, but registering her threat, the gang got up and began to walk away to somewhere more discrete.

Leah recognized someone tagging behind them.

""Todd? Is that you?""

A kid turned away from the group, said something apologetically and moved towards her as the group disappeared into the thickets.

""Todd what are you doing? Didn't Mrs Robinson teach us about the effects of bubbling?""

""You're such a killjoy Leah, grow up.""

""Grow up? Todd, you shouldn't bubble. You're the one being immature - and hanging out with those losers? They're like twice your age.""

""So what? Are you gonna tell on me? Huh?""

""Todd, bubbling does not make you look cool.""

""Teena sure thinks so. She says I look just like James BubbleBean from ReBubble Without a Cause.""

'Ugh, no. I wouldn't kiss anyone with a bubble breath.""

Todd started to walk away. ""Whatever, if you're not telling on me, I'm off.""

Leah grabbed his hand.

""What?""

""Come with me.""

""No way.""

""Just come with me or I tell your mum.""

Todd followed. They moved across the suburb and reached a cemetery as it got darker. Leah stopped in front of a gravestone. The mud was still fresh and the grass hadn't grown back.

""Why did you bring me here?""

""That's my granddad."" She pointed to the grave with a sullen expression.

""I'm sorry, I didn't know. When did he die?""

""Two weeks ago. It was the Bubblepox disease. He was your age when he started bubbling. Unlike you, he didn't even know that the fashionable bubbles he exhaled also created microscopic bubbles that were ingested on the inhale.They are so small they're directly absorbed in the bloodstream. Seven years ago, Gran started showing the first symptoms. The bubbles had penetrated many of his tissues and he was screaming all the time from the pain in his muscles and thighs. Then the bubbles entered his lungs and expanded, he couldn't walk to the refrigerator before getting out of breath. Then the bubbles formed in his eyes. And his gentle, considerate hazel gaze turned empty, two ugly bumps vibrating where his pupils should've been.""

Leah paused. ""Finally, a bubble formed in his brain and expanded. That was two weeks ago,"" she said with an air finality.

""He still lived up to ninety six."" Todd broke the silence with a reassuring tone.

""Wait here,"" Leah said. Todd protested but she threatened to tell on him again. She came back with two shovels.

Leah threw a shovel in front of him.

""What the fuck, Leah?"" 

She didn't threaten to tell on him this time. Instead, she raised the shovel over her head. Todd could tell she was prepared to swing it and reduce his brain to a pulp if he didn't obey.

They dug. Finally, Leah's shovel hit the metallic clank of the coffin.

""Help me out here."" They struggled with the lid, and with great effort were able to move it appart slightly.

The lid shifted a little and from the crack Todd could see a warm pink stream of light.

Todd stepped back and tripped on the slope of the ditch. He stared at the coffin with his eyes wide from the dirt slope.

Leah struggled and was able to force the lid off. It fell on the dirt with a faint thud.

A reddish pink glow emanated from the open coffin. A warm effervescent liquid, like boiling grease filled it.

Todd vomited.

""Hey, my grandfather rests here. Show some respect and move away if you're going to puke.""

Todd was gasping for breath. A large bubble floated up from the grease. Inside it's translucent membrane Todd could see a reddish brown lump of shriveled flesh. The grease stuck to it like ectoplasm as it rose slowly above the coffin, leaving behind a trail of long, thick drools.

""That's his liver.""

Todd puked again.

""The bubblepox disease is the only disease that gets worse when the host dies. Since there is no metabolism or immune system to hold them back, they start consuming all the organs. This is what remains.""

Todd couldn't believe what he was seeing.

""My parents are religious people, and they wanted Gran to be buried like a good Christian. But this isn't the proper place for him. His body wouldn't decay - the bubble doesn't allow any decomposers to work on it, whatever it covers is preserved in its lifeless form. There will be no 'ashes to ashes, dust to dust'- just this mess forever. He should be let free and scattered into the universe."" She watched a small bubble rise and float up into the star-lit darkness above.

 ""I couldn't find the courage to do this but after I saw you bubbling I couldn't hold back.""

""How can this be?"" Todd said between gasps and whimpers, disoriented. ""They never told us anything like this.""

""The Bubble Lobby is strong, Todd. Every politician is in their pockets. They have scientists on their payroll that sabotage attempts at scientific consensus to develop. They even have hitmen who take care of anyone convenient. My parents took a million dollars in compensation from MarlBubbles to hide the fate of Gran's body after his death.""

Todd couldn't take this sight anymore.


He fumbled in the dirt and clawed himself out of the hole, panting. Leah followed him up.

""So, Todd. Do you still think it is cool?""

""N-No. I quit.""

""Here,"" she held out her hand to Todd. ""Its a bubble gum, use it whenever you have the craving. It's not the same - the bubble never leaves your mouth and it doesn't float around and linger, but it satisfies the craving.""

Todd thanked her. 

""Let's go. Our parents would be getting worried.""

""You should go, Todd. I'll stay here for a little while.""

Leah sat down on a pile of dirt beside the fluroscent glow of the ditch, watching bubbles ascend to the sky. She wondered how high they went before they plopped.

"[WP] Blowing bubbles is just as addicting and harmful as smoking cigarettes. You're a little kid on a playground having fun until you notice your best friend blowing a bubble with the ""bad kids"".",Rasumii,"As I told Tim's parents later in life, it all happened when he fell in with the wrong crowd. My mother and I woke up especially early that day, I jumping on her bed, like, well, an excited child. She gave me a tired look and mumbled something to me about going to bed. Of course, she had promised me that day to goto the park early. She fell back onto the bed, and sighed, her hair like a large fan about her head. She rose again, and nodded. ""Well, just.. Let me get ready then.""

I was excited. I was going to see my friends Joe, my other friend Hope, and of course, my best friend! Timmy. Me and him had been through alot together, already. Broken toys, whose little girl was someone's girlfriend.. But, nothing could prepare me for what happened that day. I had just gotten out of the minivan my mother would drive around for the rest of my childhood, and paused. Tim was not waiting for me. He usually did, daydreaming with some toy, while he waited for us to arrive, his father overwatching like a hawk as he circled around the playground area.

I, of course, looked about, and gave a confused look back to my mother, who was just arranging herself as she had gotten out of the vehicle. ""Where's Timmy?"" She shrugged and gave me a confused look. She knew, as well as I did, that Timmy always waited for both of us. Occasionally, he waited to greet my mother with that stuttering voice of his. 

""H-hi, Mrs. Vick."" She gave him a smile usually and greeted him back, and then walked over to the father, and walked with him occasionally, while keeping a firm eye on the two of us. But.. Timmy wasn't here. And his father was nowhere in sight. As I cast glances around the playground, I spotted the mistake. Not my mistake. Of course, maybe, it could've been my mistake. Maybe something I had done in the past when we were young caused it. There, Timmy stood. He was blowing bubbles, the canister in his hand and a gleeful look on his face. He passed it to the next person. A bully, a person who always gave me and him a hard time, patted him on the back. An older kid who never quite grew up. There, Timmy was entrapped by him. And I was determined to get him back. 

I marched to him, and tugged on his shoulder, with sad eyes and tears nearly welling in my heart and eyes. ""Hey kid, don't you know those can kill a man, much less a kid? Those hellbubbles?"" He turned, with a look of shock upon his face. 

""Henry? It's just.. Nothing!"" The dealer gave me a firm look, the older kid was him. He looked at me, directly, and gave me a shove, the little pot in his hand.

""Hey, why don't you back off, you square. Kid's just trying new things, and its good for 'im."" Rage boiled in my veins. I was not big. He was big, but I was angry. And anger can trump how large one is, occasionally. I knocked the bottle outta his hands in a fit of rage, and balled my fist. I punched the kid right in the noggin that day. 

Now what happened next might surprise you. It didn't surprise me. I got knocked on my ass. The kid walked up to me, anger and shame welling his face. I looked about for my mother, for a saving grace to arrive. There was none. And then, something else happened. Timmy saved me. Timmy had always been a bit larger than I was, and even to this day, he still is. He gave the kid a push before he got to me. When the kid went back at me, he balled his fist, and punched the kid square in the mouth. 

When I finally looked back, Timmy stood over me with his hand outstretched. ""I'm sorry, Henry.. I promise I'll quit. I didn't like it too much a-anyways. I just wanted to f-fit in, and h-he said I was too much of a p-pussy anyways."" Of course, he stuttered more than that, but I never told a soul. His stutter was not much to me anyways. To me, he'll always be that brave kid. I took his hand.",Of_Zamorak
"[WP] The devil's lost his wallet, and you've found it",Shrykos,"I was walking home from shopping one day. A day just like every other day, I had assumed at 4:35 in the afternoon. I had gone to my soul-draining office job, typed away at a keyboard and made a few calls. My time slot was weird, as always.   
  
I remember thinking ""7:30 to 4:00 doesn't make any sense, wasn't it supposed to be 9 to 5 or something like that?"" on my way home.  
  
I had driven home, of course, then walked a short distance to convenience store on the corner. This was the choice that changed my life.  
  
I was walking home, bag of groceries in hand. I had plans to make myself something new to eat tonight, something fresh. I never did get to, though, because a brown, ordinary wallet caught my eye. Being a good Samaritan, I figured I should probably check to see if I recognized who it belonged to. I opened the wallet, and in the middle was a small flap with a clear side, containing a drivers license. I looked at the picture quickly, but didn't recognize it.   
  
The person was a man, of early adulthood. He had short, black hair that seemed to curve forward then up on top, while simply behaving like normal hair on the sides. He also had a goatee of the same black hair, that reached just barely out of the picture. His eyes were a dull brown, and nothing was remarkable beyond that. I glanced over to the name, to see if I had heard it before. ""Lucian Fersat"" it read. Were I one for anagrams, or wordplay at all, I'm sure I would have noticed before it became too late. I took the wallet with me, however, to turn in to the police kiosk near my house later. ""They'll get it to Lucian."" I had thought.  
  
Nothing much else happened, not until I got home. I set the groceries on the counter, then went to grab a cutting board when the doorbell rang. I closed the cupboard and walked back to the front door, opening it to be greeted by nothing but a blackout.  
  
I woke up some unknown amount of time later. I was laying on the ground, some sort of stone. A dim orange-ish glow came from what I could tell from ear were flames. Before even getting up I could tell the room was lit by flame. I closed my eyes, and stood up. I opened my eyes and saw that I was in a room with two fire places, one on either side of me. Behind me was a three seat couch, made of fine red upholstery and what looked like mahogany woodwork. In front of me was a rectangular coffee table. It too used mahogany woodwork, the top clear of everything revealing an intricate pattern carved into it, depicting was looked like a scene of battle.  
  
I moved my gaze further upward, and my eyes met with that of a monster. Before me, sitting on a couch identical to the one behind me, was a demon - no, a devil - dressed in a fine pinstripe suit. His massive body made him at least twice my size, an his arms were thicker than my head. His legs ended in hooves, with an extra bend in them below the knee. Above his head, cropping out of his red skin, came yellowed horns, first curving backwards, then bending forward into a slight forward point. He sat with one leg bent so that his left foot - or rather, hoof - rested on his right knee. He rested his jaw on his left fist, as if he had been waiting and grown impatient.   
  
""It's about time you finished showing up. You've my wallet, and I need it back."" The monster's voice boomed forward towards me with enough strength in it to make me nearly buckle under my own weight.  
  
""I... What? I've not got your wallet, what are you talking about?"" I blurted out as I was panicking inside, trying to figure out what was happening.  
  
""Yes you do. It's in your front pocket, you picked it up earlier."" The monster in front of me grumbled.  
  
""Wait, you mean... This wallet?"" I asked, pulling the brown wallet I had found earlier from my front right pocket, presenting it to the demonic thing before me.  
  
""Yes! That is my wallet, and I need it back. If you'd be so kind as to-""  
""No it isn't"" I cut him off quickly, out of a seemingly natural reaction. ""This wallet belongs to a Mr. Lucian Fersat. I can see it plainly on the driver's license right here, and you look nothing like him.""  
  
I screamed inside. What in hell's name was I doing?",Zeig_101
"[WP] The devil's lost his wallet, and you've found it",Shrykos,"A nondescript, if beaten, brown faux leather wallet, dollar store, he supposes snakeskin would've been gauche. *Is that gum?* He draws his fingers close to his nose, they're stained, *tobacco?* A sulfurous scent, *pitch.* He opens the wallet, notes that it is slightly frayed at the edges. Inside, Chinatown funeral props on chintzy, gaudy paper, he pauses, registers something thicker, still yellow, but a different shade, that of age, it sits behind a form-letter of gratitude to the Mark Twain Readers Association and a check made out to the Greek Orthodox Church of Elder Paisios the Athonite, that was too good to be true.The orthography, on the older paper, that is, visible from even the folded corner betrays time, and a practiced hand, monastic.

[WP] A successful but ageing actor lands the role of a lifetime in a superhero saga. Then the reviews come out.,TikTesh,"The most successful, box-office smashing movie of 2017 is, sadly, another super hero movie.  One starring Harrison Ford.  What seemed like a limited release period piece destined for straight-to-streaming on one of the lesser services struck like a bolt from the blue. What sane person would have seen that coming? Harrison Ford a super hero?  Not to be ageist, but it's only now been confirmed, following last year's leak, that a lot of the Star Wars Force Awakens budget went to hiding evidence of geriatric staff. This is not merely wrinkle reduction or hairline enhancement, but airbrushing out oxygen tubes and building in complete elevator lift systems on set to give the appearance of the actors moving under their own power.  Say what you will for real versus CGI effects, but when the production budget includes building a rope-tow on the Millennium Falcon ramp to drag the actors up, maybe it's time to rethink things a little bit.  With all of these juicy details released in the well known Hollywood Leak of 2016, it makes the job of a critic that much easier.  And, in some ways, more difficult.

The only way a super hero movie staring an actor well past his prime could work is if it was entirely voice over work, or heavily augmented with CGI, or, as with Star Wars, the entire set is a specially designed padded room, with a lot of plastic sheets, that breaks at 3:30 for a bus trip to Country Kitchen Buffet.  

But what nobody expected, and what makes this possibly the greatest super hero movie ever, is that none of those steps were taken.  Harrison Ford was perfectly cast, without the support of any CGI or geriatric propwork, because he was playing an old super hero.  And he chewed up the screen.  He absolutely dominated from the very first to the very last frame, turkey-arms and flabby gut and paralytic face and all.  Some readers don't like this kind of straight talk, they frown on critics who point out every little flaw and detail, like which side of the gene pool did Kylo Ren's schnauz come from?  Leia? Han?  These are important points that need pondering.  Similarly, if a child turns out to be empirically emo, like Kylo, is there a shared responsibility, such as not enough of a masculine influence, or, perhaps, a combination of dyslexia and a propensity for goth?  What is the population of dyslexic emos?  Probably pretty high. Did Leia have to go help teenaged Kylo pick out his first emo outfit?  Or, when being fit for his mask, was there a moment when he put on the first version which probably didn't accomodate his Solo-schnauz, and he cursed one of his parents - which one?  While writing about these little tiny plot points may seem like cherrypicking, they are nonetheless the details that helped to make his next movie such a sensation.

There is a reason the source matter or even the general story haven't been mentioned yet: It's important to understand the perfect casting.  And in order for the casting to be perfect, the story has to accommodate it.  For that to happen, the screenwriter and director, who in this case are one in the same, have to have the vision.  And that vision came from none other than Uwe Boll.

Were this movie promoted in such a way: Harrison Ford is the greatest Super Hero this side of the fjords, directed by Uwe Boll, it would never have made it out of the starting gates.  In fact, both names remained stricken from the cast list for the first three months of showings, leaving it up to purely word of mouth to spread the actual casting credits.  And, coupled with the latest detection algorithms, it's become fairly common practice in the last six months to zero in and obliterate any illicit copies.  This being Uwe Boll, of course, he took it one step further and would show up on their doorsteps, usually some smarmy twenty-something with a three-seasons long lumberjack and that certain smugness only an ultra violent german can eradicate.

If the prospect of mixing senior citizens and spandex and droog-level violence makes you lose all faith in humanity and cinema, join the club.  That was this critic's initial reaction as well.  There were so many things to hate in this movie before it even started that just sitting down to watch it felt like a soul-crushing experience.

Then, on the screen, Harrison Ford, sitting on a medieval toilet, wearing a rough, drool-stained tunic, raises his constipated eyes - and that look, the look that only an actor with an enlarged prostate could possibly know or understand - to the balistraria, squinting like only Han or Indy could.  So much is conveyed in that squint, as though it peers into the great beyond, across dimensions, breaking the forth wall, to invite the viewer to momentarily share in his constipation as though it were existential pain for once making a movie with a rapist pedophile slime bag while still being trapped in the same universe that made it all happen. Thankfully, Stanley Kubrick isn't with us to operate the camera, or we'd be treated to natural interior lighting and a very long track shot.  What Ford's squint, the fourth-dimension breaking one, is really about, is that this is a Uwe Boll flick and somebody is about to die.  A lot of them.  Horribly.  And it's glorious while, somehow, not being completely perverse. As though all of the carnage about to happen is directed at Hollywood itself, and Ford has resigned himself to own the mantle of conquest.

Understanding it's a Ford and Boll superhero flick, there is a rather strange dichotomy.  First, there is no story setup.  At all.  Outside the balistraria, constipated Ford sees a slave entering the castle walls, carrying a golden chalice.  Slowly, he draws a massive two-handed sword from a scabbard hanging from a wooden hook, the blade notched and stained and creased, as though massive claws or teeth once embraced the steel.  And he says what is sure to become one of his most repeated quotes: As though my ass needed another flame. 

Ford's nameless character shambles outside, sword in hand, and begins asking the slaves questions.  This being Uwe Boll, and the setting being very medieval, all the conversing takes place with simple monosyllabic exchanges and many a sword swing.  A finger here, a nose there, a hand or two, until it's revealed in what can only be called timeless Boll fashion, what exactly is going on.

Twenty minutes into the slave spatterfest, the audience finally hears a recognizable name: Beowulf.  Some minutes later, Ford's King Beowulf instructs Wiglaf to fetch his extra thick riding pad.  It's this kind of attention to detail that makes this more than a simple peasant rout fantasy. At this point, anyone familiar with Beowulf knows the first two parts of the story have been completely skipped, instead going straight to the end with promises of climactic dragon battle.   It takes another sixty minutes to rally the troops and punish all the slaves, which is grotesquely gratifying, as though the audience can project all of their bad service experiences onto the slave population and enjoy some retribution.  It's a twisted morality here, but, strangely, it works.

All of this leads up to Ford facing off with the dragon.  Wiglaf, whose cast name has not been revealed, and Beowulf, soaked in peasant blood, turn from his departing army to face the best looking dragon to grace the silver screen.  Even better, there is no time spent on pontification or sexualizing a serpent with Angelina Jolie's CGI chest.  It's a ferocious beast.  It kills.  And so does Beowulf.  With little more than a token quip - My ass is already on fire - they slay that dragon.  When it falls, and soonafter, when Beowulf falls, it's hard not to feel your cheeks unclench just a little bit, as though Ford somehow once more broke through the fourth wall and flushed your colon.

If you want to see this movie, it's simply called Peasant Rout, but it's really Beowulf, the original super hero, with typically Boll crappy marketing.",Wranlon
[WP] Almost everyone around Jesus was a time traveller who had come to view the origin of a major religion.,Wikiwnt,"He must have known who we were. You could tell which of us had come from a different time just by our height alone. Most of us were at least a foot taller than any body here. It was unsettling. We followed him as he dragged the cross and we watched as it was placed onto the ground and readied for our lord and savior. 

I honestly envy the Christians of the past. Those who truly, and with every drop of their body, believed in Christ. I mean, it's obvious that we did as well but there was something so much more sincere and genuine about their faith. Ours didn't seem like faith at all by comparison. It wasn't, we knew. There are some who wonder if this method of time travel has officially negated our entrance into the Heavenly Kingdom. 

Though at the same time some would argue that knowledge is what pulled humans out of the dark putrid muck that was the dark ages. There was a time when people knew that the Earth was dying and chose not to believe it. Perhaps it was the same here. Of course we're seeing it with our own eyes but I guarantee some of the wide eyed people here will still choose not to believe.

They nailed him down and lifted him up. There was not an ounce of pain visible on his face and not a sound felt in the air. He truly was the embodiment of all those Christian values we took for granted. He didn't try to attack his captors and he didn't attempt to spit at them or curse their names. You could almost see him forgiving them through his dust slapped face. 

This was the ultimate honor and the penultimate grace, to see our lord and finally understand his message of peace, love, acceptance, and good works among many other virtues. They slowly took us away. We were replaced by holograms who would carry on for a while in order to keep the illusion for the original timeliners. 

There was no reason to assume or to believe. I knew for a fact that the heavenly lord had indeed sacrificed himself for our sins. What more proof could any body ever need? What more motivation to shy away from sin? A feeling comes over you that maybe you're just a microscopic part of something greater; a feeling that everyone is just another part of you. 

I looked at the time and realized that my wife would be arriving home soon and would have no way to enter the house. I had the CryptoKey in my pocket. I tried like an idiot to open the vehicle too quickly and accidentally scratched the side of the slot. Damn it, I knew electronic signatures were more vulnerable but I hated going back to physical keys. What dumb-ass thought that going backwards in technology was a good idea. 

Probably some lucky engineer who sucked her way to the top and realized there wasn't anything left to suck before she started chocking on responsibilities. And even traffic this time of year. Idiotic tourists who flood the city thinking they'll get to see some pretty lights go up. I live here and I can tell you they're nothing to look at. I'm sure the mayor only signed the contract because his shitty company was the one producing all of the light emitters. 

I arrived home to my wife nearly falling asleep in the car. I asked if she had a long day and she had the balls to tell me that she'd been waiting for over an hour! I told her! I fucking told her exactly what time I would be back home and she still didn't listen. There were times when I'd feel bad when I looked at her bruises but then I remembered times like these. I'm starting to think that she thinks their trophies or something. Like they're something to be proud of. I don't like it but I have faith that one of these day's she'll learn how to act appropriately. ",kyron_wight

Romance isn't just sex. I'm aware.

My understanding of Tom's situation is that, upon learning that their class encourages developing romantic associations with other students, at least one of the class members obtained a copy of the course's marking rubrik with malice aforethought and attempted to convince his peers they would get an easy A by simply engaging in activities deemed ""more romantic"". This is meant to showcase the aftermath. 

I won't profess to know how you'd go about grading a class based on romance, but it seems disingenuous to assume at least some teenagers aren't going to turn that into an opportunity to bang each other. 

Oh, and don't get me started on the children their peers deem unattractive. Anti-discrimination lawsuits based on physical appearance affecting grades, counselling costs, potential suicides... The whole premise is flawed.",Geminiilover

David slammed his fist onto the bench. ""Yeah man, I get what you mean."" I said, looking at the awkward pairs of students around the courtyard. I suppose, I didn't exactly get a raw deal out of this. After all, despite the fact that the school is co-ed and had a fairly even gender demographic, the openness of the lesbians had kind of forced the gay guys to open up with their sexuality. Not a bad deal at all for me. Except, literally everyone who asked me out were people I didn't really like.    
    
My phone beeped, a message from Sarah asking whether I want to go to the movies with her later when school ended. ""Huh, I guess it goes both ways.""    
 ""Your sexuality?"" Dave quipped. I rolled my eyes.    
""No, I still like dudes. I mean, I think people are thinking I'm straight because I turned down all those guys. You know, like how they think you're gay because you turned down all those girls.""    
""I think it's also partly because I'm dating you. So, did someone ask you out?""    
""Sarah wants to go to the movies. I kind of let it slip to her a while ago that us two are dating just for the grades.""    
""I wonder if they give extra credits if you have a harem?"" Dave mused.    
""Dave!""    
    
""What? So long as the school is forcing us to do this oppressive, asexuality-erasing activity, we might as well game the system and have... have..."" he trailed off.    
""I don't think I'm going to like what you're thinking about."" I said simply, turning away so that he can't read my face.    
""Come on, Case! It'll be hilarious! I just have to get everyone in the school to date everyone, just think how much havoc it'll wreak with their stupid grading system!"" he said.    
    
""This is going to be a complete clusterfuck."" I sighed. Sometimes, I wish Dave was at least a slight bit fazed by the needs of the flesh. Maybe he wouldn't spend so much of his mental resource on mischief then.

As much as we can hope that would work out, attractiveness can't be discounted, some kids will already have significant others, and that's besides the fact that you can lose your A grade instantly if someone breaks up with you (to add insult to injury). That's also assuming the kids can put aside any sexual feelings they have for one another, which should obviously be discouraged, since it would basically turn the premise into an emotional minefield.

While many others typically used this time to hang around and chat with friends, Jude was a little more diligent and by the book.

She hoped she would be able to use her practiced skills to *maybe* get a certain someone interested in her.

She moved over to her circle of friends.

Jude starts blushing and buries her face in her arms.

Nick mutters, ""scoot over"" and naps next to her.

Hopefully, the other students wouldn't notice.

Jill is mouthing 'Noooooo'.

**Nick**: ""Really, it's not a big deal if I fail this class or not. Besides, all the other students are going to just pull someone in, and I don't wanna be a part of that.""

**Jude**: ""...oh. Okay. :-( ""

**Nick**: ""Hey, you practiced a lot and you're pretty good at some of those pickup lines and bits. I think you'll find someone just as hard working to pair up with.""

Oh man I'm beat! Mom, Dad and Jake we went to San Francisco to Visit aunt Kate and then to Yosemite for Labor day. It was a lot of fun I can't believe how beautiful it's down there. I was often thinking of something else, I'm eager to start school again. I'm a Junior now, so I know the deal. I'm getting the hang of it. I think...

Sept 9th -
I've almost taken the first class of all of the classes I'll take this period. Literature sounds sooo boring, we'll read  Shakespeare and Salinger, uhh.
Math is cool though I'll be taking precalculus since I'm in the advanced placement Math, here I know I'll do just fine.
There are only two more I'll have tomorrow, and these two are the ones that make the most nervous:
Advanced placement Chemistry, and Romantic Relationships (whatever that is)

Sept 10 -
What the actual fuck!? This Romantic Relationships bullshit is a theoretical/practical class where the final project is to find a boyfriend! What Will I do? they have to be effin' kidding. This can't be serious.

November 22 -
What will I do with this Romantic Relationships class?
Like half of the girls already found a boyfriend. Hell! Karen even got two, she dumped Kevin just because she thought she could do better! Ugh it kills me that she then actually found another one! Some of us are struggling with getting one and she is getting picky! That bitch!

December 3 -
In the theoretical part of the class I've been doing ok. I have an idea. I will ask Mrs. Johnson to just let me concentrate on the theoretical part. I bet She'll say yes, she knows me, she knows I'm an A+ student. It'll be fine!

December 4 -
Mrs. Johnson said no. They're still trying this course the project is worth 70% of the grade, I'm royally screwed.

Jan 7 - Man this sucks! Holidays are already sad enough for me to on top of this have to deal with this. I'll fail this class, and I won't go to early college entrance program, and my GPA won't get me into Stanford. So basically this stupid class has ruined my future. I don't care anymore.

Feb 2-
Ok so like 75% of the girls have a boyfriend, they pretty much have this class passed. If I can't fight this, I need to do something about it. The deadline for the project is in 4 weeks.

Feb 11rd -
So there is this guy in my class that happens to be kind of quiet, kind of weird, none of that matters because I asked him if he'd be interested in hanging out to maybe see if we can both save ourselves from failing this stupid class. It's just business. He'll pretend to be my boyfriend during evaluation then we'll both pass and I will be able to go to Stanford!
How didn't I think of this before!? It's brilliant.

March 1 - Evaluation was today. I will know the results in two weeks. But I hope Ethan and I pass the class.
Only we won't if they somehow figure out this is a fake relationship, but they won't! We've done everything perfectly, by the book! We go to the movies, he comes over for dinner. We go on hikes with his dog, he's soooo cute! ... errr I mean the dog of course...

March 16th- Yes I did it! We passed! both Ethan and I passed I'm so happy! ...
as for the relationship, I think I'll keep him. I kinda like him...
My mom likes him too, he and his family are going to the Cascades in the northwest for the summer, and they invited me. I can't believe mom said yes.
I'll be 2 months in the Northwest. I've always wanted to go to Portland, and finally I'll get to go, and with Ethan which is even better! Who would've known that stupid class would give me something good. I didn't see that coming...

*What do you mean, I have to get a girlfriend?*  

The bell rang and I gathered my things as quickly as I could. I slung my navy blue backpack over my shoulder as I heard something clink onto the floor. Bending down, I swiftly picked up the black ring and slid it back onto my middle finger. 

*Why do my hands have to be so small?*

""Hey!"" I heard a friendly voice call from behind me. I turned around to find my best friend, Ava.

""So, this project,"" She said. ""I'm like, one of 3 lesbians in this school."" Her voice trailed off as her eyes traveled to my right hand. 

""Oh.""

*She remembers.*

""What are *you* gonna do?"" She asked.

I give a nervous shrug as we continue to walk down the busy hallway. 

""Seriously, you should get exempt from the class or something.""

I shrugged again, and walked a bit slower so she could catch up.

""Thanks,"" she said, acknowledging that I had slowed down.

We walked a bit further in silence. ""Bye! Text me!"" She said as she turned the corner.

I kept walking, consumed with anxious thought.

*How am I gonna BS my way through this? I can't have a girlfriend! That's not fair to either of us!*

I swiftly turned a corner and saw my Geometry class approaching on the right. 

*I guess I'm attractive enough to give some girl confidence or something. I'll take as many cute Instagram pics with her as she wants. Yeah, that should work. Then we break up after the project ends.*

I entered the classroom and took my seat in the back. 

*Unless she gets attached or something.*

The anxiety returned almost as quickly as it had left.

""Alright,"" My teacher addressed the class. ""Last night's homework was..."" She paused to flip through her pink notebook. ""Page 309, numbers 1-19, plus the proof. 

I raised my hand as papers rustled around me. 

""Can I please use the bathroom?""
I asked her. 

""Sure, Ryan."" She replied. ""Just leave your homework on your desk so I can check it when I come around.""

I retrieved my homework from my backpack, left it on my desk, then took the Lavatory pass from her desk. Gripping it tightly in my right hand, I started down the hall.

*What do I do? Pretend?*

And then I saw her. Her long brown hair, flowing behind her as she walked. Her white miniskirt, that seemed to fit her perfectly.

But I didn't feel anything.

*Why can't I just think she's hot? Why  can't I just have normal hormones like every other student in this giant school!*

Her gold earrings, her adorable shoes, her tiny little nose, all my aesthetic. But wasn't I supposed to feel something?

Her perfect teeth, her-

Black ring.

On her right middle finger.

As quickly as I could, I held out my hand to her and asked,

""Are you in Romantic Relationships?""

She rolled her eyes and sped up her pace. 

""No, wait! It's not like that!""

She kept walking. 

""Look, I'm ace, and aro, and I just need to pass the class. Please!""

And like magic, she heard my call for desperation.

She turned around.

""What's your name?"" She asked.

""Ryan. You?""

""Samantha,"" She said with relief.

She held out her arms to me. 

""Thank you so much,"" she said.

We hugged for a few seconds. And she let go.

We traded numbers, and I continued to the bathroom. 

And my grade was secured.

And I had a new friend.

And my stress was gone.

"[WP] High schools introduce ""romantic relationships"" as a new school subject. In order to pass, you have to find yourself a girlfriend/boyfriend before the end of the year.",_Moink_,"The beginning of the year started off slow. The already established couples paired up. Then, the good looking guys were given a reason to ask out the good looking girls, who accepted. The homely guys and girls paired up. Lastly, the average ones matched up.

I remember seeing my friends being eliminated from the ""single"" pool as the months went by. At first, the partners would be seen walking down the hall making uncomfortable small talk, but as the weeks went on, there was effortless physical contact and they all had chemistry in their own ways.

Just last week it was down to my two best friends and I. The girls were nearly all gone, so the three of us decided to pair up. Only rule was it had to be a one on one relationship. So we went to the fairest way we knew how to settle it. Rock, Paper, Scissors. Best 2 of 3, of course. I ended up losing. My two best friends requested a homosexual relationship and I was left stranded.

The following day I went to go see the RR teacher and asked to see the list of remaining singles. As I looked it over I could see the list of names with corresponding lines to the person who they were matched with. It was messy. Lines were erased and re-drawn. Trades were made. Students who had relationships in other schools were separated off in their own pool. It was overwhelming.

As soon as I found my name I scanned the opposite side for all the possible matches. I flipped through the dozen or so pages looking for an unmarked student. It looked like all of the guys were spoken for and it seemed all of the girls were too. I was about to give the list back to the teacher when I noticed an unmarked name on the last page. It was a girl. Oh, no. The one name I had dreaded. Katrina White. My ex.

""Mr. Egg, I can't be partners with Katrina. We broke up this past summer and it wasn't pretty. There has to be someone else. Anybody else.""

""That's the rule for the class. You have to find a one on one relationship before school ends. And she's the only other student not taken. I'm sorry.""

I handed him back the list and left his classroom. I pulled out my phone and scrolled for her number. 'Katrina. DO NOT TEXT'

I texted her. ""Katrina, I know you don't want to talk to me, but we have to get together for this Relationships class in order to pass. I asked Mr. Egg for an exception, but he shot that idea down. Text me back so we can meet after school.""

20 minutes later she replied. ""Fine.""

The day dragged on. I couldn't help but imagine how awkward this was going to be. The checklist was tedious. The things we, as a couple, had to do before the end of the year was going to be awful. They were things new couples would love doing, but not us. Things like: going on a first date, going on a date without cell phones, meeting each other's parents, hanging out with each others friends... I wouldn't enjoy any of these and I knew she wouldn't either.

The final bell rang and I packed up my things and waited outside school where Katrina and I used to meet up. The minutes crept by. I felt as though I was picking her up for our first date again. My heart raced and my tongue dried up. My hands were so clammy I had to wipe them off on my jeans. 

I began to think she ditched me as another ""fuck you"" for dumping her. I scanned the parking lot for the few remaining cars and picked her's out. She hadn't left yet. I turned back to the front doors. There she was. Walking down the stairs long brunette swaying back and forth. Her mid-thigh length skirt showing off her long, tan legs. Chatting with her friend she showed off her smile. What was once a smile full of metal braces now revealed pearly-white teeth. I couldn't imagine what caused me to break up with this girl.

Katrina noticed me at the bottom of the stairs and concluded her conversation with her best friend, Allison, who never tried to hide her disgust with me after I broke up with her best friend. As they approached me she looked me up and down, didn't say a word, and waved bye to Katrina.

""Hi, Kyle. How are you?""

""Still hates me, huh?""

""Um, i don't think she hates you. That's just her, you know that.""

She wasn't always like that, but I wasn't about to fight. ""Ok. Just curious.""

""Yeah, so, it looks like we're a bit behind. I was thinking we could go to the mall for the first date assignment. I have to get a few things if you wanted to come.""

That seemed easy enough. ""Sure. Ok with me.""

Over the next couple of months we were able to catch up with the majority of couples. We had gone on dates, ""met"" each other's families, went to parties with both group of friends. In order to speed up the catching up process we bought condoms in a grocery store, purchased Plan B in a drug store, and made it through a family get together without fighting. Our previous relationship was like practice for this course. It was as if we had gone through a rehearsal and now it was showtime. We were nailing these assignments with ease.

We were getting good grades and quickly were approaching the top of the Realistic Relationship leaderboard (My two best friends were in first place). With a month left before the school year ended we had one major assignment remaining: get into a organic fight and come out of it peacefully. It was the one thing on the list you couldn't plan and I thought we would have completed it long ago, but were actually fairly civilized, and hardly even disagreed on anything. 

That was until the week before the final project was due. The thought was bouncing around in my head. We are so good together. We laughed, bonded, enjoyed eachother's company. Why did we break up in the first place. I had to ask her. I was going to ask her that night.

""Hey, uh, Katrina.""

""Yeah?"" She was facing the other way, busy with Biology homework.

""Weird question, but why did we break up anyway? I mean we're so great now.""

""Well it's an assignment, Kyle. It's not real.""

I figured she would say that. ""Yeah, I know it's not really real, but it's kind of real, right?""

She dropped her pencil and looked me in the eyes. ""Sure, we're human. We're gonna feel things, that's natural. But, you're putting on your best face, I'm putting on mine. It's not really us. It's like we're performing AT one another. We're not really being WITH one another, you know?""

""I guess. But I still like when I'm around you. I miss you when you're not around. What do you call that?""

She sighed. ""Sure, Kyle. I miss watching American Idol when it's not on, but I don't love American Idol. It's just a habit.""

""You're comparing me to American Idol?""

""Yeah, probably not the best comparison, but you catch what I'm saying. We're spending a lot of time together, so it's only logical we're going to feel each other's absence.""

""Fine. I just feel like we should drop the act then. Let's try for real. Let's be together."" I looked at her hopefully.

""Kyle, I've always felt that, but you didn't. You broke up with me.""

""Yeah, but that was a mistake.""

""You're saying that now, but how can I believe that? When just last summer you were treating me just like you are now? As soon as I felt comfortable with you, you broke it off.""

I was thinking back to last summer. The day we broke up. I had broke up with her over text. Pathetic. After that it seemed like we avoided each other. Or at least I was avoiding her.

She continued. ""You couldn't handle the fact that I was becoming part of your life. It was too much for you. You were afraid that one day I might end it before you could and that terrified you. So, you did what you did and it was over. Like it never started. I never saw or heard from you after that.""

I was staring at her in disbelief. Couldn't believe what I was hearing. But after she put it into words I totally understood. Everything she said was true.

She continued again. ""And I was heartbroken, Kyle. Here I thought was this great guy who liked the shows I liked, got along with my family, not to mention was easy on the eyes, and then one day he's gone and I'm supposed to be okay with that? You did to me what you we're so afraid would happen to you. So, yes, Kyle, we are getting along, but it's a far cry from being real.""

That tore me, ripped me apart. Hearing what I did to someone who I really loved, who truly loved me, sucked. I was thinking of how I felt the whole time, forgetting how bad she must've had it.

""I'm sorry, Katrina. I had no idea. I fucked up royally. I hope you can forgive me.""

She was looking down. Tears visibly running down her cheeks. She wiped them away leaving only red eyes and displaced mascara.

""Means a lot, Kyle. Seriously. Would've been nice to hear it a year ago.""

I lowered my head and began watching my twiddling thumbs. ""I know. But you summed me up. You know me better than I know me. Everything you said was right. I was scared. I looked at you and knew you could do better than me and that scared the shit out of me. So, I ended it. I needed to control my world and if me choosing to let you go was part of it then that's what needed to happen. My insecurities got the best of me, Kat.""

A minute by with silence. I felt her soft hand raise my chin up and we locked eyes. She was smiling.

""Now that was real, Kyle. Also, it looks like we completed the last assignment. Not bad.""

I nodded. ""Yeah, not bad.""

A knock at the door interrupted us. It was her father. ""Time to go, Kyle.""

He has always scared me. ""Sure thing, Mr. White."" I stood up and gathered my things. ""See you tomorrow, Kat.""

She stood up and kissed me on the cheek. ""See you tomorrow.""

Blood rushed through my body. I was elated. What just happened?!

I heard a throat being cleared. Mr. White was not enjoying the moment like I was. I took the hint and rushed out of there. Making it to my car and throwing it into reverse. Backing up I saw Mr. White eyeing me from the front door, but from the top window I saw Katrina waving at me. Smiling. I thought to myself: 'might have to take this class again next year!

"[WP] High schools introduce ""romantic relationships"" as a new school subject. In order to pass, you have to find yourself a girlfriend/boyfriend before the end of the year.",_Moink_,"I got into education so I could teach European History, not romantic relationships to teenagers. I never really was a big hit with the ladies -- God knows my own high school experience was nothing to write home about and college was, well, I was happy in college, OK? So I never had a girlfriend, I was fine. I enjoyed my studies, had good friends, dated here and there without getting serious, and now I’m on a good career path at a prestigious school teaching history; that’s a lot better than most other history major. I’m sure someone will come along. So why is my department manager echoing my mom and telling me I need to find a girlfriend.

“I mean, Rob, I’m not saying you *have* to find a girlfriend. That would be a fireable offense for me to say that to you. I’m saying… well, it would help to teach a subject you know. Or, you know, if it’s a boyfriend, that’s fine, too,” my department manager was proud of how subtle she was being, she held her head up a bit higher. “Oh, but don’t ask *me* out! I’m happily married,” she chuckled.

I sighed. “What about sex ed? What was so bad about sex ed?”

“Well, you know, parents prefer to teach their kids the birds and the bees on their own. But romantic relationships can be so complicated, as you know… Well, no, sorry, I guess you don’t know… But, you know, um, it’s a lot of information. How to be respectful to someone. How to handle budding hormones and heartbreak and all that. Think of all the things you could teach! Poetry and biology together -- very interdisciplinary!”

“But I need to find a girlfriend -- or boyfriend -- of my own first before teaching it?” I said. This conversation was absurd.

“Well, yes, by the end of the year would be ideal. You wouldn’t be a history teacher without a history major! And we won’t fire you, but, you know, we do pay by the class here and, well, budget has been tight recently…”

I threw up my hands, but, within, I had to admit that I was slightly motivated by the $3,000 per-semester-class paycheck to go ahead and try to find a girlfriend.

“Fine, fine. And how should I prove I am in a committed relationship? Public pronouncement? Copulation in the cafeteria?” My department manager waved that all away, the mere suggestion more than she wanted to hear.

“No, my dear, I think we will all know when you are in love -- we will be able to read it on your face! And then you can pass this knowledge down to the students in a confident manner.”

God, I hated this school. But, hey, for an extra $3,000 and some archaic knowledge I guess I can try to find love. For the children’s sake.

"[WP] Two of your friends are heavily debating whether a zombie apocalypse or a post-nuclear war apocalypse would be worse. They ask you for opinion but instead, you tell them of a much worse apocalypse you call the Internet Apocalypse.",comphys,"We used to do something called a 'symposium'. My name, not theirs - although, I stole it from the Greeks. There's just the four of us, including me, discussing whatever we might have had in mind, over the week. Everyone sits in a circle, in my friend's wooden shed. It's got a fireplace in one corner, a nice little iron cage. Gives the entire thing a charming, rustic atmosphere. I enjoy the ostentatious formality. We started doing this in high school, and it always had this bite of satire about it. A few young adults - not even in university yet - working out a few issues, coming to a conclusion, and nodding it into the ethers of answered questions. A closed-door conference, where the very future of the world could be predicted, and decided, if just for a moment, between the four of us. Mind you, when I say conclusion, I don't mean we toed a single line. It was enough to conclude on a definition. To understand an issue just a bit more, and conclude on the differences we couldn't resolve. Conclusions to questions that we'd keep, forever and ever, to ourselves. I don't mind letting you have one conclusion. I've at least the one to spare. 

The Apocalypse. I'm a religious fellow. Not overly so, and certainly not a literalist fellow, but the idea of Revelations has always held a bit of purchase for me. I should read it, sometime. The rest are a more secular bunch. To them, the most terrifying thing they can imagine is an apocalypse from the Darkness. From the murky world of pathogens - a zombie disease, somewhere in the soil amongst the botulism, and the MRSA, and the terrors of the microsphere. From the skies, called upon by democrats and dictators as a pseudo-holy cleansing of the sins of their counterpart - casting stones at each other, in a shared glasshouse. And I agree. It's worth fearing those little, unthinking parasites. Those little blobs of RNA, and DNA, and whatever else goes into a politician. They'll eat you up from the inside, leave you apathetic, ready to feast on the flesh of your brothers and sisters.

I may be stretching the metaphor.

But, regardless, that's not my revelation. I am not scared of losing my mind to a disease, of becoming an empty husk as a host to some prion, or virus, or some such microbial marauder. Nor am I particularly scared of becoming an unwitting pawn in the game of thrones - the admittedly understandable response of a half-dozen world leaders to an errant piece of military technology, larger and more costly than I. I don't blame them for, in the stress and heat of the few minutes they will have, forgetting that there are consequences they will never experiences. But, I have more faith in them than I might let on. I don't believe that there is a conference room, somewhere in the world, where the men and women who run from the offices of power to the control panels have decided that the Apocalypse sounds like a plan. Nor do I believe that, amongst the fearsome candidates for extinction, that one is the thing of horror games, or horror movies, or horror board games, or horror roulette.

And if I'm wrong, it's nothing that we've not seen before.

What I do fear is not someone having a lapse of judgement, or a lapse in immunity. What I fear is the slippery slope. I know, everyone's favourite logical fallacy. But, an irrational fear is still a fear. And what I fear is making the choice to reject the metaphorical salvation. More to the point, making the choice to buy into that fel fate willingly, and with my compatriots across the world. It won't happen immediately - there will be no 'red button', no 'patient zero'. That choice will be a whole decision chain, culminating in a choice that to you - to the me now, bemoaning this bizarro-world chain - will be unthinkable.

They say that the internet makes the world smaller. Virtually, infinitely smaller. If I wanted to, I could send an email to...say, a student in Ghana, or in Chile. Hell, I had a Chilean peer in a class last year. In Africa, about 5% of the population have internet access. That's a terrible rate, compared to that in the Western world - but, it means that 5% of the population of Africa can with a click of their fingers, and a mouse, do something that all the Kings and Queens of Europe couldn't have done prior to the internet. Timely, cheap, marginally more secure communication across the world, with whomever you want. As long as they have a DSL line, or their own satellite dish, or some other such nonsense. It's a powerful technology in the modern world, and it defines everything about us. 

There are pacemakers, security suites, power stations, webcams, even fucking doors controlled by the whims of a Bluetooth receiver, or a modem, or a home server. I don't watch television anymore. I just have the internet for entertainment.

Someday, according to the craziest whims of sci-fi authors, the internet could become us. Craziest whims next to faster-than-light travel, and replicators that create better food than a modern in-flight meal. But I digress. As we speak, media theorists - the oddest social scientists, if you exclude psychoanalysts, and the Germans - are trying feverishly to construct thereotical frameworks that consider how people respond to their social media profiles. It's become mainstream in media theory to think of profiles as not representations, like maps or pictograms of your life, but even as extensions of your physical body. At once, both a physical space you can adjust and perform in, and a virtual space you think, breathe, and move in.

Imagine, for a moment, if we were to extend even that. Not all at once. Over time.

If we bought a 3D printer, and could paint our thoughts into being with just a touchpad and creativity.

Then, we bought an Oculus Rift, perhaps. A set of three-dimensional goggles, that let us see things in the virtual world and the real world as one and the same. Where with just a set of gloves, we can sculpt things that are just as real to us as the art we can touch. And, if you happen to disagree, you could just print it out.

Self-driving cars. Home management systems. Voice-controlled smartphones and PCs - Cortana, Siri, and the rather less anthropomorphized Android variants.

We slowly take our steps towards moving our world from our bodies to our 'bodies'. That virtual platform my university professors are so intent on convincing me are as close to me as my heart and mind. More real than our souls.

It's not that I'm scared we'll someday choose to be 'in' the internet. It's that, eventually, we'll realise there's nothing left to bring in. And it's not that I'm scared about getting to that point. It's a bit more visceral.

Imagine living in the internet. Having homes with white picket fences, and cars. Whatever car you want. A Bugatti, maybe. Or maybe that's not quite your speed. Go for a Ford Model T, safety's not an issue. Just as they did so many years ago, they can cross intersections at full speed, weaving through traffic with a mind outsourced to some central server in the Googleplex. And if they fuck it up, well, hey. It's the internet, we can put you back together. There would be nothing left for us in the physical world - the 'other' real world. I'm scared we'll forget that 'other' real world.

What we'll start to study is not the world we were born to, but the world that we created. And it's not that I fear a Matrix, where there are questions of reality to deal with - to choose between one or the other world. I'm scared that, where there is no choice to be made, all of us - myself include - will make a choice anyway. That all of us will, by consensus - every single one of us complacent - choose to make one world real, and one world imaginary. Because the real world is dark and filled with terrors. The internet apocalypse does not scare me because it is real. I don't believe that humanity will truly choose to just abandon one world for another. It is no more real than the nuclear apocalypse leaving behind stragglers, across wastelands, or a zombie apocalypse doing the same.

My fear is that none of us will choose to be survivors, even when surviving is as easy as pressing a button. 

The Internet Afterlife will be too tempting. And, as a result,

there will be an Internet Apocalypse. It will leave a world from which there can be no more conclusions. All because we didn't stop to stoke the fire, take a seat, and keep talking about it.

"[WP] Humanity has the ability to gain powers based on how immense or intense their suffering is. You somehow manage to achieve the powers of a god, yet you don't know how you were suffering at all.",deeed22,"Power rippled under his skin like electric currents branching out, desperate to flow out of him. His feet were no longer on the ground - he was ten feet in the air, floating high above his friends' heads and he didn't know how to stop it. Power ripped out of him like lightning, striking the ground and burning it. Trey stamped out the ensuing fire quickly.

""What's going on??"" Dylan screamed, but his voice wasn't the same sleepy tone it normally was. It was dark, and deep, and it boomed out of him like thunder. His chest ached from the heavy vibrations of it.

Anna was just below him, and her red hair was flipping chaotically in the wind. She looked as if a particularly strong gust might just knock her over.

Reaching up, she called out, ""Dylan! You have to control it!""

But Dylan was terrified. He'd never felt so *strong* before. He'd always been a sickly kid. When he was very little, he was diagnosed with leukemia, and all his life it had just been one battle after another. Making it to his late teenage years was a miracle, especially after all of his doctors had told him at one point or another that he could expect to die young.

The chemo and cancer treatments left Dylan weak. He was short, skinny, and always tired. His blond hair was thin and almost wispy, and he had deep bags under his green eyes. Bruises were a daily occurrence for him, and physical activity was exhausting at best.

His muscles twitched heavily under his skin, and he awkwardly attempted to direct the power swimming through his veins to the tip of his left index finger. Bright light shot out of it and lit up the sky, leaving a thunderous, ""**BOOM!**"" behind in its wake.

Anna flinched underneath him, and Trey grabbed her quickly and wrapped his arms around her protectively.

Dylan gasped, realizing that his friends were afraid of him. ""I'm sorry!"" he cried, trying to reach for them on the ground. ""I can't control it!""

Trey, who had a few powers of his own, shielded Anna behind his back. Trey was big, tall with broad shoulders and thick muscles. He had a square jaw and protruding brow, thick cube-shaped fists and a solid frame. His skin was light brown, like not-quite-ready toast, and his hair was cropped short and wavy.

Trey stared up at Dylan with intense eyes, the normal golden yellow narrowed in deep concern.

""You have to control it, Dylan, or it's going to rip you apart!"" Trey yelled above the roar of the wind, and Dylan knew he was right.

Dylan had never had superpowers before. Karma, the force that ruled the world, ensured that everything was equal. Bad people suffered for their wrongs, and good people who suffered grew powerful from it, being rewarded for their pain. A child who tripped and scrapped his knee might find himself able to hear extraordinarily well, if only for a small time. A widow who lost her true love might find herself able to fly, at least until the loss didn't hurt so much.

Growing up, classmates and teachers and doctors and nurses and just about everyone he ever met always asked Dylan why he didn't have superpowers. All the other cancer patients did, and some of theirs were stronger than anyone else in the world. But no matter how many rounds of chemo, how many bone marrow transplants, how many visits and revisits and extended stays he took to the hospital, Dylan never got superpowers.

At first, he was extremely jealous of all the other kids. They got to fly, or be invisible, or have super strength. Sometimes the mayor of the city called on them to save people from dangerous situations. The more pain they suffered, the more they were rewarded.

Upon meditation of the conundrum, Dylan first arrived at the conclusion that Karma did not grant him superpowers because he was bad, and he deserved to suffer. After sobbing hysterically into his mother's lap, however, she gently explained that he was a perfectly nice little boy who did not deserve any pain.

Knowing his mother must be right, Dylan drew the only other conclusion he could. He was not suffering. 

*He tugged the doctor's sleeve, urgent question forming in his mind.*

*The doctor, Dr. Dogood, he liked to be called, looked down at him with a smile. ""Yes, Dylan?""*

*""Is pain real?"" Dylan asked, wide-eyed and innocent.*

*Furrowing his brow, Dr. Dogood replied, ""Well of course it is. You feel pain, don't you?""*

*Dylan nodded, then shook his head. ""But is pain something that you can pick up and weigh and say how much it is?""*

*The doctor was simply giving him a confused look, so Dylan knew he wasn't getting his point across. Frustrated, Dylan rushed out quickly, ""Is my pain the same as your pain?""*

*That seemed to give the doctor pause. He tilted his head and rested his hand on his chin. ""No, it isn't. Everyone feels pain differently, Dylan. Something that hurts very bad for you, might not hurt so bad for me. Some people take pain very well, and some people cannot take any pain at all. Everyone is different.""*

The revelation had struck him like a ton of bricks. The reason Dylan never developed any powers was because he wasn't in pain, at least not like the other kids. Suddenly, he wasn't so jealous of their powers anymore. After all, he'd gladly take no powers and the pains he felt over whatever horrific and traumatic pain they must feel.

It changed his whole outlook, really. He had nothing to complain about. When others got hurt, they got super. When he got hurt, he got nothing, so he must not have been hurt, truly. So he never complained that he was hurt, or tired, or suffering, because he *wasn't*.

Until apparently, he was.

Power tasted like electricity on his tongue. If he didn't direct it, didn't move it around under his skin, it would rip out of him, shooting lightning out in every which direction. He didn't feel the constant fatigue that he normally did. He wasn't tired, or sleepy, or in any pain at all.

He was *alive*.

Anna cupped her hands over her mouth and shouted, desperately trying to get her friend's attention. ""Dylan! You have to-""

A bolt of lightning struck the ground just beside them, and Trey flung them both out of the way quickly. They landed on the ground with a hard thud, and Anna could smell damp grass and dirt.

Dylan looked down, horrified. He almost hurt his friends. This power, this strange thing he could feel in every one of his cells, pulsing through him with every beat of his heart, was his, and if his friends got hurt, it would be his fault. 

He took control.",HabitBandit

Trey awoke a few moments later to a hand gently carding through his hair. Opening his eyes, he saw Dylan there, leaned over him, eyes full of concern.

""Hey,"" Dylan said, but he didn't quite look the same. Trey remembered Dylan as a dorky, fragile looking kid that was going to tear Trey's heart in half some day soon when the cancer got the better of him.

Trey loved Dylan, not like he loved Anna, but close. He was his best friend, his little buddy. Dylan was so bright, all of them time, even when he was so tired Trey didn't think he could keep going on. Dylan suffered, the world could see it, and Trey knew that it was wrong that Dylan didn't have powers. Dylan would reply with the same old, ""I'm not suffering,"" crap every time, but Trey wasn't a fool. 

Dylan had cancer. Dylan lost his parents, both of them, in his early teenage years. Dylan was frail, and weak, and hiding dark secrets behind his withered green eyes, Trey could see it. 

Trey had lost his mother when he was younger, and was super strong for it. The loss still ached deep in his chest, but it was bearable, and sometimes, forgettable. Dylan had lost both of his parents much more recently, and sometimes when Dylan slept on his couch he would scream in his sleep, scream and cry and thrash around and Trey knew it had to be nightmares about his parents, but when Dylan awoke, he'd just smile peacefully and say he had slept fine.

So Trey knew that something wasn't right. Anna had agreed with him, had wondered why Dylan was powerless as well. She had theorized that maybe he killed someone when he was little, but Trey scoffed at the notion. The sleepy eyed blond boy that slept on his couch and never complained about anything, ever, could do no such thing.

""Are you okay?"" Dylan asked, concerned, and Trey nearly laughed. He sat up, studying his friend's face. 

The bags under Dylan's eyes were gone. His face actually had color to it, and his skin was much less transparent. His eyes were actually glowing, the green shimmering like a glinting emerald. He didn't look like he might collapse any second. For once, Dylan actually looked strong.

""Are *you* okay?"" Trey asked dubiously, but Dylan reached out and touched the side of his head. When he pulled back, his fingers were covered in blood. 

Trey must have hit his head against a rock when he threw himself and Anna out of the way. A faint throbbing on the side of his head confirmed it. ""It's nothing, just a small-""

Dylan reached out and touched the wound again, and suddenly the throbbing stopped, and Trey felt all better.

Trey gasped. ""Dylan-""

Dylan looked at his own hand in confusion. He looked from Trey, to Anna, who was sitting on the ground beside him, back to Trey again. Slowly, Dylan stood up. Whatever was happening before must have stopped, because there were no sparks flying from his skin, no lightning bolts ripping out of him, and his voice no longer boomed like thunder. Trey could still sense the power, though, could see the energy, tight and controlled, lacing Dylan's every muscle.

""This is because I loved you, both of you,"" Dylan said, and Anna looked at him sharply at that.

Dylan began to back away slowly. ""I do, I love you both. But you have each other.""

""Dylan!"" Anna gasped, struggling to get to her feet.

Dylan shook his head. ""Karma has decided. You have each other. And I have power.""

Anna reached out for him, *""we love you too,""* on the tip of her lips, but it was too late.

I looked up at the man speaking to me.

""Not really your place to tell me that, huh? You wore the same thing.""

Both of us stood looking ridiculous clad in grim reaper outfits. I would never wear it, but I had great respect for my dead friend. He insisted that his funeral wouldn't be too serious. But what excuse did this guy have for wearing something so outrageous?

""So why are you wearing that?"" I asked, not sure whether to be amused or annoyed. 

A grating reply: ""I need to look the job, don't I?""

I stared for a few moments, confused. ""And what job is that? Do you dress up as the grim reaper for funerals often?""

""No. I usually don't come to these."" He looked over at the graves wistfully. ""Their lives here don't really matter after I help them pass on.""

I gaped. ""You expect me to believe that you're really the grim reaper? I don't even believe thats a real thing.""

""Your friend wanted you to know that he always appreciated you. You were one of the people he was most fond of as he died.""

I felt a little offended now. This disrespectful idiot couldn't go around telling people what their dead loved ones thought. ""And I suppose thats why you came? To deliver his final message or something?""

""No.""

""So, what? You came to retrieve his soul? Take him to the after life?""

""No. I already retrieved it.""

""Why did you come here, then?""

""To ferry souls to the afterlife, of course. That is my job.""

The hood tilted towards me, gradually, and without revealing a face. It moved back towards the coffin, where it lay on the shining rollers. The gaping maw of the crematorium's oven sighed behind it.

""That's a real guy, right? Vitton?""

The hood dropped an inch; raised an inch.

I gestured towards the coffin. ""Asshole asked us both to do this. And I thought I was special.""

I got nothing.

""It is kind of overkill, though. Isn't it? I mean, two Reapers? That's not how it works, is it? Why ask both of us? Did you know I was asked to dress like this?""

The hood shook slowly, from left to right and back.

""Lack of communication,"" I said. ""It's sad.""

Nothing.

""So..."" I said, dragging it out as long as I could. ""You are?""

He turned towards me. In the shadow of the hood lay dark and fear that stretched to eternity. ""**I am.**""

I swallowed through a throat suddenly cracked and dry. His voice was the grinding splinters of broken bone. ""Wha -"" I managed.

""**Indeed.**""

""Why..."" I spluttered, ""are you here? He's gone. He's been dead for days.""

The hood aimed towards the coffin. ""**He is not gone. He lies alive within the coffin.**""

I gaped. ""*What?*"" I asked. ""What? Why?""

""**A prank, he thinks. He thinks, a social experiment.**""

The room started spinning. ""Then why... why are you here?""

No, I'm not kidding. It's true. People with terrible behavior pass it on, and in a way the whole thing makes perfect sense. You just need to consider it under the proper context. Why stop at the parents? What about the communities and social structures built into them?

Researchers knew for years that poverty, parental abuse: These were two of the main reasons for future issues for people in adult life. Higher rates of drug abuse, violence, mental issues and disorders. The problems really stemmed from much wider-spread influences though. It was just much more difficult to track them, follow the correlations without presuming too much. 

No one was willing to make that claim, even with proof.

So when the ""Rapture"" happened, and people quite seriously started lifting off into the sky, and dissolving into particles of light... Well, we'll admit, there wasn't anyone was too concerned with the specifics right away: Not when people were being obliterated. 

The trends were apparent soon enough though.

Only the shitty people were being taken. God only knows why, or where. You've got ten thousand different theories on that particular topic.

But overnight, people that murdered, raped, abused, molested- people that caused unnecessary harm or grief intentionally, that refused to see perspectives other than their own in order to live with intentional and often malicious ignorance. The people who lied and cheated and stole.

Poof. Gone.

All that was left were the people you might consider normal. Maybe not great (though some were) but not bad. 

A single day was all it took, and the impact was dramatic. That basic lack of trust between strangers was erased overnight. After a week, it was more than obvious that the dangers lurking within our own society were simply gone. The predators who lived among us had ceased to be, the liars and the cheats who abused the systems- leeching and stealing from the many simply didn't exist, and neither did the truer criminals.

If people needed help, it was an honest plea. If individuals wanted to give it, if was a true offer. Even in the worst of regions, neighborhoods where people hid behind heavy locks and barred windows, you could walk down the street without fear. We, as human beings, had been our own worst enemies for so long. So long... but no more.

A generation passed as the ripples settled. Borders opened, conflicts ended. 

The disease was gone.

That is the core of our philosophy, here at Flippy's Pizza Emporium. "" Was the guiding advice my boss Mr. Anthony gave me twenty minutes ago as I headed out towards my car. I didn't tell him, that may not be so easy on this delivery.  I instantly recognized who this order was for, tried to pass off this delivery to one of the other drivers. I even had my sales pitch down, who wouldn’t want to swap for this delivery as it was in the higher end of town? Unfortunately no one were back yet to switch, and Mr. Anthony wasn’t going to give away a free pizza because I didn’t want to make a delivery.  

Order #241 was for the middle school bully. He wasn't a jerk in the way bullies are often portrayed on TV. He didn’t give anyone swirlies or beat them up on the black lot. Rather he would insult you for the things you couldn't control. ""The Air Force would love to have a landing strip the size of your forehead, "" ""Even the homeless wouldn't want your clothes,"" or favorite “My parents are successful unlike yours!” were some examples of what he would use to say. He never really picked on me, as I mostly tried to stay as invisible as I possibly could, but the stuff he would say to other kids always made me upset. The other kids had trouble coming up with comebacks. Andy was well spoken, athletic, and all the girls thought he was cute. His parents were incredibly successful, he father was a software engineer and his mother was a patent attorney. In all the years I knew him the teachers were always so kind to him, his parents gave him everything he wanted, and he didn’t seem burdened at all by hurt he had caused others. 

I looked at my watch, 4:28. I only had two more minutes to think of something witty or clever to say. ""Still living at your parents HUH?"" Was about the best I could come up with, but as I looked at the home, I couldn't blame him for that. Maybe he has matured in the past 10 years, or karma caught up to him to him a tragic skiing accident left him horribly scarred. Probably neither of those things occurred, what if recognizes me? What leg would I have to stand on? I dropped out of Community College and am a pizza delivery guy. What kind of insults could he hurl at me now? 

I sighed notice the second hand getting closer to the twelve on my watch. I didn’t have a clever remark or comeback, but I wasn’t about to give ole Andy a free pizza! I rang the bell. “Just a minute!” I could hear from the back of the house, sure sounded like Andy. He opened the door, it was definitely him. He still had the same chin and hair, but he had grown taller and was pretty muscular. I puffed up my chest to the best I could so I could say something clever. “Man you guys are quick! How much do I owe you chief?” I hadn’t considered it going like a regular delivery. “$26.34 is your total.” Andy opened his wallet and gave me thirty. “Keep the change,” he said as he closed the door. I stood there for a moment, relieved and a little disappointed at the whole interaction. I thought about knocking again and giving him a punch in the face and saying something cool like “And that one is on the house.” But I never did. I just got back in my car and drove back to the restaurant.

""Got any plans?""

""I'm gonna go visit my parents once I'm done here."" my smile was faltering. Sweat was threatening to break on my forehead.

""That's nice.""

I started to feel incredibly self-conscious as we stood facing each other. I could only see his head, floating out the door, his eyes pouring over me and always slowing over the package. Just as sweat started to break, the package started ringing.

I jumped back as the man jumped out the door, looking uncomfortable hungry.

""Four-thirty on the dot! Let's go, come on in, hurry,"" his face was pressed against mine as he lead me inside. 

""I'm not sure I should--""

""Nonsense, come on,"" he practically dragged me in.

The first floor was a pure white and smelled of an incredibly strong garlic. My eyes started to water and I started coughing by sheer intensity of the smell entering my system. Everything burned by the time we made it across the hallway and out another door. We were outside now. 

""Ah, Nathaniel! How is the delivery boy?"" asked a stout woman, drinking water from a wine glass.

""He's a family man!"" said the bald man, leading me to a chair to sit down in.

""Oh! I love a man with something to live for!"" she said giddily.

""Are you comfortable?"" Nathaniel asked as he sat me down.

""Yeah, I--"" I realized I wasn't smiling anymore, but at this point it didn't matter. ""I'm a little uncomfortable being here, actually.""

""That's understandable, we'll be out of your hair forever in a minute. Is the chair comfortable, though?""

""Yeah, it's fine..."" I trailed off as I realized how many cameras there were pointed around outside. The woman was the only one out here, but she was speaking to a microphone and gesturing to cameras. It seemed that many people were watching this backyard. 

""Ready!?"" called Nathaniel.

There was an audience of cheers over speakers and the lady.

""Let's begin!"" he yelled and some sort of cage fell around me.

""HEY!"" I screamed.

""Place your bets, people! Last words?"" called Nathaniel.

""Pleas to stop for 10,000!"" replied a speaker.

""Oh! His family. His family for sure!"" called the woman. ""20,000!""

""I bet a man like him has a girl. 15,000,"" called another through their speaker.

Nathaniel was nodding as he took all of these notes down on a piece of paper.

""What's going on here!?"" I exploded. I kicked at the containment, but it seemed that there were no openings in it. It was clear and had wires running through it. There were small microphones and speakers lined up on the wires. ""Let me out!"" I screamed, more out of frustration than anything. 
 
""Time of death?"" asked Nathaniel, not missing a beat.

""4:35!!"" called someone, enthusiastically.

""Stop! Let me out!""

I only now realized that I was still holding onto the box and that it was releasing some noxious red fumes. It smelled awful, and I was wondering how I couldn't smell it in all the time I was holding onto it. Seconds later, it burned to breath.

""It hurts! Wait, please!"" I felt fluids running down my eyes, and I don't think it was tears.

""Stop talking kid, you'll get me a nice $10,000 out of this,"" spoke a speaker that had spoken earlier.

Were they betting on me? Were they betting on my death? I was in too much pain to get a grasp on the situation.

""Why isn't he smiling?"" the woman asked, ""why do they never smile? I thought they were asked to smile.""

""They usually get selfish at their time of death, dear,"" Nathaniel said, sighing ""they don't sympathize with us because they don't understand us.""

""Please!"" I cried again, finally thinking to fumble in my pocket for my phone. As the screen was spattered with my dripping blood I saw that it had no signal. 

I accepted that I was going to die. This was it. I brought in my own means to my end. I looked at the box as it continued to spew the gas and I collapsed in my chair.

""I hope you all--"" I started coughing blood and loosing consciousness. 

""Looks like the House wins last words again,"" one of the speakers said, inciting some laughter.

Red poured over my eyes as I faded into black.

The second recipient was a 15-minute walk away. The neighbourhood was beginning to regain life by this time. Children's voices echoed in the air while most adults were still at work. 

Her name was Dana. I reread the peculiar instructions, trying to decide if it was an elaborate joke for newbies. But Rob had said to do as it said. I was just going to have to do exactly that. 

I got to Dana's door. As instructed, I took off my striking windbreaker and kept it. I knocked on her door. 

No sound came from the house. I knocked again. 

Five minutes went past but it felt much longer. I decided to knock for one last time before concluding that she was out.

She opened the door before I could knock, taking me by surprise.

She looked like she was in her thirties, but it could have been the dark shadows beneath her eyes that inflated her age. 

*Say nothing*

I held up the parcel and pointed to the name. She nodded and I handed her the parcel.

She was looking for a form to sign. I had none. Then she proceeded to swing the door to a close. Gently but firmly, my palm on the door kept it open. She stared at me, puzzled. I looked directly into her eyes in return. 

*Stay for however long needed*

My job wasn't done yet. In that moment she seemed to understand. She focused instead on the small parcel in her hands, and began to unwrap it. 

The wrapping gave way to a little red box. We both knew what such boxes held. I began to smile, but she covered her mouth with a hand and began to sob softly into it. 

I stayed. She opened the box to reveal a silver engagement ring with a sparkling diamond mounted on it. That's when she broke down, sitting squarely on the floor to cry. 

I sat on the steps in front of the door because there was nothing else to do. I sat with her as she sobbed. When she paused to read the note to her, she returned with fresh emotion in her steaming tears. 

I didn't know how much time passed that we sat like that. Finally she said, ""He died on the battlefield 2 months ago. Today would have been our anniversary.""

I nodded, my back still facing her. ""Thank you, whoever you are,"" she said. When she stirred, I stood with her. 

""Thank you for staying with me, and more importantly thank you for bringing this to me. It means the world to me."" 

When she gave me a quick but earnest hug, it took me aback. But as we pulled apart, I nodded and smiled at her as I waved goodbye. 

This was the start of the strangest part-time job ever. ",youandzen
[WP] It needs to be delivered by 4:30p. And do so with a smile.,koulnis,"It was the strangest part-time job ever. Let me try to recount it in a way that does justice to it.

**Deliver Joy, period**

Here I was, staring at this advertisement and wondering why they did not simply punctuate properly instead of using the word, “period”.

But I decided to check it out. The selection process was simple. 

“Describe your happiest moment in the past year.” The interviewer Rob must have been a couple of years older than me. “No orgasms,” he added helpfully.

“Well…it must have been when I got the letter from the college, informing me that I had gotten in.”

“What did it *feel* like?” The emphasis could have been creepy, if not for his genuine smile and general enthusiasm.

I blinked. “I must have literally jumped for joy. It was my dream course, and it turned out to be everything I wanted and more. Now I’m here, trying to get work to support myself through it.”

Rob’s eyes narrowed. “You will find – if you get the job – that this is more than just a job. You may learn more about what it means to be human within a few months in this job than most people learn in a lifetime.” 

It sounded unlikely, but I nodded because I was the one being interviewed.

“Hold on that feeling of joy when you got the enrolment letter. It’s what we aim for, every time.” Then he added, “if you get the job.”

“When will I know if I get the job?”

“Now. When can you start?”

*What?* But I didn’t miss a beat. “Immediately.”

“Good, you’re in. Now let me show you the ropes.” He led me to the storage room and proceeded to pick out a windbreaker that was in an eye-catching red, to match the corporate color. 

“Your dark jeans are fine…” he murmured to himself. “Oh wait, can you ride a motorbike?”

“I can’t.” I couldn’t think of a way to soften the response to a yes-no question.

“Pick it up. We’ll pay for it.”

It took me by surprise, I was expecting to be told that I will not be getting the job after all. His attitude intrigued me so much that I said, “Okay.”

“Great. Now, let’s get you some work.” He walked me into another side of the building which, in contrast, was bustling with activity. Men and women in the same red windbreaker were moving quickly on their way. A few of them smiled at me. I smiled back, feeling strangely out of place.

“Wondering why they’re all so happy?” Rob rightly guessed. “It comes with the job. Alright, here we are.”

We joined the end of a long queue to a counter, but the queue moved remarkably fast. I quickly realized that this was where they collected the parcels to be delivered.

“Hey Rob,” the staff at the counter greeted cheerily. “And you are?” she asked, looking over to me.

“Peter,” I told her. Her name plate read Kat.

“Nice to meet you, Peter.”

“Why don’t we start him off with two parcels?” Rob told her. “Not too far because he doesn’t ride yet.”

“Sure,” she smiled, “let’s see what we’ve got.”

Rob ran me through the job. “Each parcel is meant for the recipient and no one else. Never let anyone receive on another’s behalf – joy does not work that way.” 

I nodded.

“The sender attaches two notes to each parcel. The first is to Deliver Joy, explaining the context and the requirements. We then decide whether to take up the job or not. If we do, we will replace the first note with a card with instructions to the JoyBringer - that’s you. Just remember: whatever the card says, do it exactly.” He looked me directly in the eye as he paused. Again, I nodded.

“Of course, the second note is for the recipient. As the JoyBringer, you won’t see the first note at all – this is our way of keeping the Delivery fresh and fun for all involved. And needless to say, the second note is not for you to see either. I said ‘needless to say’ but I still said it because we've had some dumbasses who did exactly that. I don’t fancy people who compromise what we do here. Got it?”

“Got it,” I confirmed.

“Alright, read the cards and be on your way. Deliver joy, Peter.”

I thanked him and he left. I flipped to the back of the red Deliver Joy instruction cards on both parcels and read them.

The first one read, “Deliver by 4:30pm today, and do so with a smile.” It sounded simple enough.

The second one oddly said, “Take off your windbreaker before you come in contact with the recipient. Say nothing as you hand her the parcel. Stay for however long needed.”

I looked at the addresses and the requirements, and planned my route. Kat had chosen convenient locations for me. I went on my way.

The striking red of my outfit drew plenty of glances on the streets. In the close confines of the subway, it finally felt too much and I took it off and kept it in my backpack. 

When I got to the door of the first recipient, it was 4:18pm. I almost knocked on the door, before I caught myself and put my windbreaker back on. I reread the instruction card. “Do it with a smile.”

I knocked on the door and readied my best smile.

After a while, the door swung open. “Oh it’s Deliver Joy!” she said with the brightest of smiles, looking at my chest for a name plate. I didn’t have one yet.

I was lost. No one told me what to say, so I said, “Hi Nally!” (I recalled her name from the parcel.) “I’m Peter, from Deliver Joy. You’ve got a parcel!” 

I handed her the parcel with both hands. She took it and began tearing it open right away. I wasn’t sure what to do in that situation, but it felt right to stay.

She unearthed a clown’s hat, which was bright, frilly and silly. She pulled it out, letting the rest of the wrapping drop to the floor, and got into a fit of giggles. She took a look at the note to her and laughed so hard that she bent over, finally squatting to the floor.

I could not help but smile, bemused at the situation. 

“My goodness. He never fails to get to me, every time,” she said as she wiped an emerging tear from the corner of her eye. Finally, she got up and proceeded to put the hat on my head. “Thank you so much, Peter. You have an amazing smile, too.” She then waved goodbye and closed the door. 

“Alright…” I told myself. I really wasn’t sure what had happened, but it felt like I did my first delivery right. “Deliver joy,” as Rob had said.

So I kept the clown’s hat and went on my way towards the second recipient.

[WP] It needs to be delivered by 4:30p. And do so with a smile.,koulnis,"""Why would he have me do this?"" I asked my co-workers as I frantically tried to find a way out of what my boss had just asked me to do. All he said as he handed me the notice I was to deliver was that ""It needs to be delivered by 4:30. And do so with a smile.""

My office-mate Dan chimed in ""It is odd, but you know how Mr. Lawrence hates to be questioned.""

""You're right, I guess I'll just get it over with.""

&amp;nbsp;

As I biked down-town I went over my delivery again and again. I tried it in a very solemn voice, but with a smile, which didn't make sense. I tried it out in an excited almost high-pitched voice, but that didn't really make sense. I tried it with different accents, in a cool ""smooth talker"" type voice, and even with different inflections, always with a smile, and never quite right.

I pulled up to the apartment building and went inside. My stomach was in knots and my palms were sweaty. Usually I wasn't this nervous to give any type of news or announcement, but the smiling was quite odd. I knocked on the door and waited. I heard shuffling from inside followed by soft footsteps. A tall woman with dark features answered the door.

""Mrs. Stevens?""

""Yes... How can I help you?"" She asked semi-nervously.

I put on the biggest smile I could. Grinning from ear to ear I said, ""I regret to inform you that your husband died in a plane crash early this morning. More details will be sent by telegram which can be received at the address listed here.""

I handed her the envelope with the details of her husband's death, still smiling, still sweating.

Mrs. Stevens broke down. She was obviously upset at the loss of her husband and was bewildered by my huge smile as she began to cry.

I stammered awkwardly about being on my way as I stepped back and made haste down the hallway. What a weird experience. Why would he have me do this?

&amp;nbsp;

I got back to my office to find a note on my desk, which read ""Edgar - hold off on the 4:30pm delivery, I gave you the wrong file. Cheers! Mr. Lawrence.""",DiscoFett

"[WP] Write about Greg, every time you say Greg, you have to add something in parenthesis after it.",lsts123,"You all know Greg (Mykolayiv, not the other one). He's not a bad guy, right? Shows up, does his work. The thing about Greg (that you might not know) is that three days ago he went missing, and we've been looking for him ever since. 

First we talked to his mother. She said Greg (her oldest child and by far the most responsible) had gone to work Sunday morning. But upon talking to his siblings we found out that Greg (perhaps the oldest, but by no means the most responsible) was having an affair with a doctor at the hospital where Greg's sister (a nurse) worked. 

We went to talk to her,  but she said she hadn't seen Greg (though she had heard from him) in several days. They last had a telephone conversation the day before he disappeared. Greg (calling from work) had told his mistress that he was going to come clean to the husband. The mistress, as you can imagine, was less than happy.

We followed the trail to the husband, but there was no sign of Greg (as was expected). The husband said he had never met Greg (though had seen him once at a hospital gala), but that if the son-of-a-bitch had the nerve to show up at his house he'd punch him so hard that Greg (and supposedly his and his mistress' children) would never forget it. 

Yes. That's the major point we left out about Greg (the pregnancy). His mistress was pregnant. So Greg (probably suffering from desperation at this point) packed his bags and left. But the mystery still remains of why Greg (a self proclaimed Mama's boy) didn't say goodbye to his family or give notice at work. 

We went back to interview the mistress. we noticed that she had dirt under her fingernails. She said she had been working on the garden that she kept behind the hospital with Greg (who, from what we gather, was more a watch sports from the couch kind of guy).

Whatever is going on, we're not sure where Greg (if he's still alive). Has gone off to. Mostly now we just have strings of loose ends. But maybe if we tie them all together, we can find some sort of answer. ",232C

"[WP] An Inside Out-esque scenario, but instead of the emotions being personified it's the stats of an RPG (e.g. SPECIAL from Fallout).",ojcoolj,"Hidden away in the dark lurked a foreboding room. There was no entrance, no exit. The walls were carved from living stone, intricately detailed and unfathomably old. A ring of carefully sculpted pillars supported the cobwebbed ceiling, depicting fierce battles and legendary treasures. In the center of the room stood a shaft of rowan wood, twisted and ornate but seemingly naturally occurring. Rather than branch out and bloom, however, it ended entwined about a softly pulsating crystal the size of a man's fist, the source of the soft pink light that illuminated the room. A thick blanket of mist shrouded the floor, appearing to glow with the light of the crystal. It slowly wafted back and forth, swirling slowly about the pillars, as well as the robes of the six dark figures that stood silently arranged around the central shaft.  
  
The largest of the six stepped forward to the spire, swept back the hood of its deep grey cloak, and placed one massive hand palm-down on the crystal. It flashed a deep red and grew suddenly brighter, throwing light around the room and on the face of the man standing before it. His rough, battle-scarred visage twisted into a sinister smile and he turned to his companions to speak, his hand never leaving its place.  
  
""My comrades,"" he boomed, ""the obstacle before us obviously requires a full-strength offensive! I will gladly take over from here. Allow me to clear the path toward conquest and glory!""  
  
The brute gripped the crystal tightly and focused. As he did, the chamber seemed to rock and shudder, as though the very ground beneath them protested. A second figure rushed forward and pushed the behemoth of a man out of the way, taking the crystal with it's own more slender hand. It flashed a pale yellow that fell harshly on the angular face revealed by the now absent cowl of the second figure. The tall, slender and angry woman glared daggers at the first man, practically spitting her words at him.  
  
""You fool! You can't just rush headlong into this, we'll all be killed! At least let a more dexterous professional such as myself keep us from being shot down before we begin. We have to flank the target, or we don't have a chance.""  
  
 As the severe woman concentrated on what she was doing, the room seemed to tilt from one side to another, threatening to throw the remaining figures off their balance. In the midst of the developing chaos a shorter and much stouter man flipped back his hood and trundled up to the shaft, seemingly oblivious to the rolling floor. He plopped one hairy-knuckled mitt on the crystal and the room took on a sudden emerald hue. He completely ignored the woman who had been there before him and who was now pummeling his thick head with a flurry of impressive, but ultimately ineffective, blows.  
  
""You know,"" he said, ""we should really leverage our superior constitution. Just prove we can take whatever is thrown at us."" He grinned. ""Wear 'em down, that's what I always say.""  
  
He stood stock still at the rowan staff, not seeming to make any effort in particular. Meanwhile, the room began to develop a faint haziness, gradually obscuring vision and turning the brilliant green of the crystal into a sickly chartreuse. The remaining figures removed their hoods, as though they were having trouble breathing easily. One of them, a young man of very slight build, rushed forward and pinched the simple man's nose until he was forced to comply and step back from the staff. The newcomer swiftly stepped in and placed his palm upon the crystal almost disdainfully. The light turned a rich and dark purple, and the young man rolled his eyes at his compatriots.  
  
""Have you no intelligence whatsoever? Are you attempting to eradicate the lot of us?"" He turned back to the crystal and closed his eyes. ""I surmise it's left to me once again to rectify the situation. Kindly remain stationary while I present our adversary with an indefatigable and irrefutable debate. We will certainly emerge victorious momentarily.""  
  
An elderly woman stepped forward and placed a gentle hand on the young man's shoulder. ""Son, I think it might be wise to hand the reigns over to me. It's said that discretion is the better part of valor, and that seems quite prudent at the moment.""  
  
The young man hesitated, but eventually bowed to the wishes of his more experienced senior. The crone set her gnarled and bony fingers on the crystal, changing it to a calming indigo color. The haze left the room, the floor settled, and all the figures took a deep breath of relief. All but the last one.  
  
The remarkably handsome gentleman swaggered forward and draped one arm around the wise old woman. ""Granny, you do a great job around here. You know that, right?"" He aimed a white smile and a wink at her. ""But I said it before and I have to say it again. This is a job that requires finesse, appeal, a certain je ne sais quoi. This is a job for... Charisma.""  
  
He wrested the crystal from the woman's hand, and the chamber was once again bathed in a soft pink light.

Ashley watched in growing confusion. She had been enjoying a drink with a couple of her friends, grooving to the music, when a handsome young man had caught her eye. She had thought to flirt a bit, since he was pretty cute, after all, but that was certainly off the table when he abruptly turned to the stranger next to him and knocked the guy out cold with a wild haymaker. He proceeded to take out three more random clubgoers with vicious blows before the crowd withdrew from him in terror. With a ring of onlookers watching in bewilderment and fear, the young man squared off against a single brave fellow who had taken it upon himself to bring down this strange assailant. The young man had ceased his own attack entirely, dodging and skipping around in a manner completely different from his previous straightforwardness. It was bizarre to watch, but the club's heroic defender never landed a blow on the mysterious stranger.  
  
Abruptly the elusive young man ceased his skipping and calmly strode over to the bar, where he began downing the shots that remained there. The defender saw his opportunity, and launched himself at the stranger. As his attacks had no effect, however, he slowly came to a frightening conclusion and retreated.  
  
The violent young man finished his twelfth shot, wiped his mouth, and staggered over to the table where Ashley and her friends sat, trapping them in the booth. He proceeded to present a detailed and convincing series of reasons why Ashley's companions should, in essence, beat it. They needed little convincing, and as soon as they were fairly certain it was safe to move, they both made a dash for the club exit. So much for friendship.  
  
Ashley was frozen with sheer disorientation, and watched helplessly as the unstable young man turned toward her and took a deep breath to say something. However, he instead abruptly turned around and headed toward the club exit himself without a word. She was just beginning to get a grip on herself when he paused at the door, turned back, and jogged over to her table once more. He sat down next to her and smiled, oblivious to the panic behind him and the sound of approaching sirens.  
  
""Do you like my new jacket?"" he murmured.  
  
Falteringly, she stammered, ""Y-y-yes?""  
  
""Do you know what it's made of?"" he crooned.  
  
Unsure, she ventured, ""...No?""

He mindlessly upvoted all the posts, typically without reading them, before deciding to head to bed. It was nearing 4am. Austin slowly moved through his dimly lit room until he found his bed. Despite the room being dimly lit by the PC, he had bad vision so it was hard to navigate around the piles of old soda cans, dirty dishes, and filthy clothes. Laying down, he drifted off wondering if his inbox would be full of idiot females defending their 2 brain cells in the morning...

Austin stretches in bed. His bones crack from a heavy night's rest. He sits up in bed, instantly remembering his callous response to the female, and excitedly got out of bed to check his messages. His stomach churned in excitement as he made his way through the garbage maze, sat in his chair, and... No new messages. ""Damn!"" he cursed under his breath. ""Maybe now is a good time for that shower?"", he thought. He creeped up to his door to listen for his parents. The house was silent, so he hoped they were at work. He opened his door, momentarily startled by the daylight coming in from the window in the kitchen. Quickly making his way to the bathroom, he undressed and gazed at himself in the mirror. Pale, sickly skin, balding, yellow eyes. The stench of infection wafted out of his mouth from his gut. He figured he couldn't hide it from his parents much longer, his new ""condition"", especially with the smell, but showering couldn't hurt.

It's my first day of my second round of high school, I checked the mirror at my house before I left and put on some Axe Cologne. I don't actually have any classes so I'll probably just roam into one. Drama sounds good. 

Why is everyone staring at me? I know you've all seen the walking dead before. I grunt, but nobody says anything.. Right. Right. They don't understand me, but aren't all teens misunderstood? I laugh to myself at my own joke. Some girl is approaching me.

""Nice costume!""
-grunt-
""What's your name?""
She looks very pretty.. -grunt-
""Well, My name is Cindy..we should go out tomorrow for coffee. I love mysterious guys.""
This is the easiest date I've ever gotten. I should write a book on dating, and I would if i still had all of my fingers. 

Day 34-
I wonder how this girl is going to react when she realizes I'm an actually zombie. Oh there she is! I try to wave but my hand just kind of.. Eh. Stupid joints. 

""Hey! I see you're really into character. That's awesome. I've always been really into drama and acting. It's crazy to see someone get as into character as I do.""

This girl really thinks I'm in costume. She must not smell the stench of rotting flesh. What would a zombie like me do without teenage boy Axe Cologne? Is she still talking? I should be listening.. right? Oh no.. I'm hungry.

""Braaaiiinsss""
Oh no. I fucked up. 
""Oh my god. You're so sweet. Finally a guy who likes me for my brains, We should go back to your place.""
I agree. We should, that would be fun. I get up and motion toward the street. Walk normal. Just walk normal. You can do it legs. I'm still slouched but I'm making good pace. She's next to me. Zombies gonna get some Tonigggght!! 

""Is this your place? It's nice."" 
We've arrived. Yes. Let me just unlock the door and...
""Braaaiiiinsss""
Oh no. Here it comes. Full on zombie mode.

Day 35-
I think I'm going to go back to my normal routine. I'll just watch Tv to pass the time.

-News comes on with an amber alert.- ""Missing teen girl Cindy, found dead in a ditch. Police have not released an official statement, but from what we can tell.. Her head is broken open, and there are several bite marks on her.""",attemptingla

He turns to 5th Street, and saw the entire block was on fire. 
""Awww. Really feeling like some falafel. Well, next stop, home!""
     Tim strolled towards his abode, making sure not to stain his new shoes in the debris left by the most recent looting spree. Tim came up to his apartment, and saw it was standing today. ""Yes! Third day running!"" Tim said as he walked in. The new bullet holes added charm, he thought. He entered his room, and started scavenging for whatever he could find. It was probably Alexi that got him this time, since the floorboards were pried up in some places.
     Tim sighed, and started sweeping up the shattered china and bullets, and dumped them in his disposal. Tim was feeling good after his day. His house was intact after the daily VirtuaCrime reset, and he got some great hot buns from the bakery until Tomas blew it up. Afterwords, he logged a half day at the mail office before someone drove a stolen car into the building.
      
Lindsey Collins booted up her VirtuaCrime surveillance software, and started searching for anyone who could be defined in the loosest terms, as ""sane"". The VirtuaCrime program had shown almost no success so far, and a month longer with no results, and the program wold be iced. Then she saw him. Tim Jenkins, living the life of a sane, balanced citizen as much as someone could in VirtuaCrime. She called her superiors, and told them the news. However, she neglected to scan his records, as was uniform, too excited with her find.
     The awakening was a silent ceremony, and all the officers hoped for success. Slowly, the pod opened, dispensing Tim into the real world. He looked around, at the people waiting for the first word to come out of his mouth. But what he did shocked them even more. He lunged for the nearest person, and in their shock, no one moved. 
    As Tim left the room, shifting the door behind him, Lindsey Collins's  screen glowed, a few words glowing. 

Tim Jenkins, 28 Years Old, in the system for 6 years. Crime:Murder. Charmingly deceptive, he had gotten away with a murder thanks to his innocent seeming persona. 

That murder soon became half a dozen, the next dozen, then more. Tim was on the loose.",otblock57

"[WP] You just got a job at a blood bank, only to realize every other employee is a vampire.",the_str,"""What the fuck?""

""Hey, didn't anyone tell you that staring is rude?"" Shannon said, still with that huge friendly smile on her face.

""What the fuck is that?"" I demanded.

""Ok, Jason, the cat's out of the bag. There's something you should know about Gérard Choiseul's Royal Blood Bank of New Orleans."" Shannon went on.

My head turned back to the table with the dead girl but Shannon placed her hand gently on my chin and turned it back to her.

""As I was saying, Jason, focus, Jason, half of the people working at Gérard Choiseul's Royal Blood Bank of New Orleans are vampires,"" she stated matter of factly with that genuinely friendly and cheerful smile that seemed permanently stuck to her face.

I turned to look at the dead girl again. The dozen people at that table seemed to  be having a jolly old time as they were laughing and joking with one another as the lifeless girl's eyes stared back at me. I saw Françoise and Joséphine sitting at the table and sucking the meat off the dead girl's fingers.

""Oh my God, are you going to kill me?"" I whispered at Shannon, seconds away from pissing my pants.

""Kill you? Oh God no,"" Shannon said while good-naturedly. ""Look if we wanted to kill you or harm you or turn into some kind of play thing, we wouldn't have hired you. Besides, do you know how hard it is to find a competent medical technologist? Well, we could hire someone from India but the visa application process can be such a bitch. Never. Again.""

""So you're not a vampire?"" I asked.

""Me? Oh God, no. Well, it's not like I haven't thought about it, but I love going to the beach to get myself a tan. The whole no sunshine thing was a deal breaker for me,"" Shannon said as she stuck her fork into her Caesar Salad. ""I mean, when I'm 35 and I start to feel like my looks are starting to go downhill, I might revisit my decision, but I'm happy being human for now.""

""Em... ok. Who's that dead girl on that table?"" I asked.

""Em... from the looks of it, a tourist, I'd say. Midwest maybe, judging from her thighs."" Shannon said like as though none of it bothered her. ""Don't tell anyone, but I'm actually from Wisconsin myself. Had to fight like hell to wean myself off the cheese. Cheese is legal crack, I tell you.""

""I don't get it. If we're running a blood bank, why don't they drink that blood? Why kill that girl? She probably has a family."" I said.

""Oh, Jason. You're so sweet,"" Shannon said. ""She probably had a family. But you know, they've got to eat. Besides, we're running a business here. We'd end up broke if they ate into our merchandise. That's just bad for business.""

""Look, if you haven't killed me yet, I guess that you won't. And I'm sorry, but I don't think this is a right fit for me. I think you should keep looking for a medical technologist,"" I said. To this day I have no idea where I got the courage to say that in front of a dozen vampires who were at this point sucking the marrow out of the dead girl's skeletal remains.

""Oh you can't quit, Jason,"" Shannon said, with a look of horror on her face. ""Remember Sergei? The one with the peculiar dietary tastes? He's the one who makes sure that our blood bank's employees' identities remain a secret...""

Shannon didn't have to finish what she was going to say.

""You're telling me that Sergei will eat me?"" I asked.

""And your girlfriend"" Shannon said with an apologetic expression on her face.

""So I'm stuck working here at Gérard Choiseul's Royal Blood Bank of New Orleans until I die?"" I asked.

""Die? No, just until the contract ends, which is for another two years, at which point, there'll be a renegotiation or a voluntary decision to not renew the contract,"" Shannon said.

""Is that a euphemism for 'then they will kill you'?"" I asked.

Shannon audibly sighed. ""Jason, you really shouldn't watch so much tv. This isn't Fangtasia where we kill people willy nilly. Aside from those that they need to munch on, we really don't kill people unless we have absolutely no recourse to ensure our secret remains safe. At the end of your contract, should you choose not to renew it, we'll have you sign a non-disclosure agreement.""

""You realize that this is all kinds of fucked up, right?"" I asked.

""Oh you get used to it,"" Shannon said while sipping on her cup of coffee.

""YOU BITCH!"" Françoise screamed at Joséphine from the other table. ""I called dibs on her right kidney!""

They bared their fangs at each other and almost seemed like they were ready to tear each others' heads off.

""You should try the coffee, Jason,"" Shannon said. ""It's out of this world.""",theultimateword

"[WP] You just got a job at a blood bank, only to realize every other employee is a vampire.",the_str,"You have no idea how long it took me to land this job. Who am I kidding? Of course you do. Unless you've been living under a rock, the past few years have been economic boom times for everyone except for millenials.

You name it, I've done it. Server? Bartender? Ridiculously undersized bouncer? Phone sex operator? Door-to-door magazine subscription? I'd done it all. This was going to be my first adult job! Well, ok, maybe the phone sex gig was my first adult job but you know what I mean. This was a job with health insurance and a 401(k).

After finally putting myself through graduate school, I got hired as a medical technologist. Ok, for you laypeople out there, dumbed down version, I test and confirm the accuracy of blood tests and when I don't do that, I do sleep-inducing paperwork. I guess I should have figured out that something was weird when I saw the name of the blood bank - Gérard Choiseul's Royal Blood Bank of New Orleans.

Oh come on. It's New Orleans. Of course there is going to be some business with a funky name. And I desperately needed a job - like my girlfriend is giving me growingly less subtle hints that she wants a goddamned engagement ring at any minute now kind of desperate. So you know what? Bite me! Actually come to think of it, that was a rather poor choice of words.

So, first day on the job, and everything is great. The clinic is new, clean, has all these fancy equipment that smells like it just came out of the factory. The bank had no windows at all, but I didn't notice because it was so well lit. Fluorescent lamps and all. Yes, the place smelled like a bit too much disinfectant had been used, but after you've worked for an entire summer at Arby's, you can withstand just about any odor.

The lab supervisor, an unnaturally happy and spunky blonde named Shannon gave me the tour.

""As you can see, Jason, our blood bank isn't that big, despite the rather pompous name, but it's a really nice place to work. Let me introduce you to the people you'll be working with.

""This is Travis, the compliance coordinator. He's the one who has to make sure that everything we do here is strictly up to FDA standards.""

Travis gave a smile and firm nod and went back to work. I smiled back and kept following Shannon.

""And this is Françoise and Joséphine, our on-staff clinical nurses. They're the ones who help our clients to make their donations. Say hi to our new hire, ladies,"" Shannon said sweetly.

""Bonjour,"" these buxom redheads replied in unison.

""Er... bonjour"" I replied back, all the while trying my best to imagine my grandmother naked. It was the only thing I could do to make sure that I didn't get an erection right there.

They giggled as I turned around like as though they knew what I was thinking.

Bubbly Shannon, as I had decided to call her then, kept on going. ""And this is Janet. She's our in-house electrical engineer. She's the one who makes sure that the walk-in coolers remain operational.""

Janet was a dour-looking frumpy woman on the wrong side of her forties. No concern for sexual harassment there! Janet grunted something under her breath and went back to her coffee.

""And this is Sergei, our lab manager."" Sergei had high imperial cheek bones, the downward sloping wide lips, and the eyes of a haughty aristocrat. In other words, how I always imagined Disney villains come to life would look like. Just like I imagined, he gave an arrogant ""hmpf"" for a greeting and walked into his office.

""And you'll meet everyone else later. It's lunch time and they're all downstairs at the mess,"" Shannon said. ""Actually, the rest of us are headed downstairs for lunch now. Would you like to join us?""

It was my first day. What was I going to say? No? That's not how you fit in with people whom you hope that you will work with for a long time. Of course I said I would. The fact that Françoise and Joséphine were motioning me to follow them downstairs didn't help. God, the things that I would do to them! Yeah, as it turned out, the proper phrase would have been ""The things they would do to me"" but I didn't know that at the time, did I?

Sergei stayed in his office.

""Isn't Sergei joining us?"" I asked.

""Oh no. Sergei prefers to eat alone. He has... peculiar tastes"" Shannon said with a slight tone of nervousness that I had not heard before.

When we reached downstairs, a rather unhealthy and skinny looking fellow was there to greet us.

""Good afternoon, ladies. Travis. I see that we have someone new today,"" the creature said.

""Jason. Jason Talbott."" I said.

""Talbott... I knew a Talbott once... a long time ago. Rather violent fellow..."" the creature said like as though he were attempting to recall something from eons ago. ""Oh but where are my manners? You look human. Will you be having the chicken or the fish for lunch?""

""Er... chicken, I guess,"" I said while looking around with a stupid and incredulous smile on my face."" Françoise and Joséphine just giggled. God, the pillow fights they could be doing. No, focus, dammit.

""And the usual for you, ladies?""

""Yes, Renfield,"" they replied.

""Renfield? You mean like from Drac..."" I couldn't finish my sentence as Shannon grabbed me by the arms and dragged me toward a table. ""Come on, Jason, I want to know everything about you.""

But I couldn't take another step. As I stepped inside the mess hall, I noticed that there were a dozen or so people eating together at a table. Nothing out of the ordinary there. Except there was also a dead naked woman lying on the middle of the table and she was full of bite marks.",theultimateword

He was looking at the hot blonde through his office window. Love the businesswoman look. He said eyed the heels, stockings, and power skirt. He pulled a bottle of mouthwash from his desk drawer, gargled and spit into his trashcan. He stood and briefly checked himself out in the mirror on his desk. A wink and point later, and he was outside on the lot. “I see you have an eye for quality,” he said walking up to the woman. “That’s a manual, but it does come in automatic.”

The woman didn’t take her eyes from the black sedan.

“Yep, this thing is fully loaded too. Power everything. Hell it’s even got heated and cooled seats.”

“Zero to sixty?” The woman finally spoke. Her voice was sharp and authoritative.

“Oh, it’ll go down the road. This model is the CTS-V…”

The woman looked at him and narrowed her eyes. “Zero to sixty?”

“Right, sorry, about three seconds. It has 640 horse power. It’s got the Corvette Z06 Engine in it and…”

“How’s the trunk space? Will it hold four duffle bags?”

“Sure, kids huh? Yeah, that shouldn’t be a problem. Wanna take it for a test drive?” Don asked dangling the keys.

The woman cracked a smile at last. “Yes.”
 



“Wow, you do like speed.” Don held onto his seatbelt with both hands. “Try to keep it under a hundred,” he half joked.

“This clock right?”

“Yes, it’s set via satellite. Guaranteed to be accurate.”

The woman sped up even faster, and weaved between traffic on the two lane they were travelling. She frowned. “Traction control?”

Don pointed without tearing his eyes from the road. “Yeah, it’s… woah… right here.”

The woman pressed the button, down shifted, pulled the emergency brake and drifted around a corner.

Don wiped sweat from his brow. “Turns on a dime right?” He gave a nervous laugh.

The woman jerked the wheel again and parallel parked perfectly.

“Parking assist,” Don said checking his pulse. “Is that my heart or do I hear sirens?” He watched as two men with sharp suits and duffels exited the building beside them.

The woman flashed the lights and popped the trunk.

“We’re robbing a bank aren’t we?” Don asked realization finally dawning.

“Of course not.” The woman said to him calmly as the two men entered the back seat. “They did.”

“I am so getting fired.” Before Don had a chance to exit, the turn signal turned on and the woman pulled out in front of a line of police cars. The car picked up speed, but one cruiser managed to pull up beside them. “Forget fired, I’m going to prison.”

The woman slammed on the brakes, and the cruiser flew in front of them. She cut down a side street and narrowly missed a garbage truck.

“Forget prison, I’m gonna die!”

“Cops are all over,” said one of the men in the back seat.  He was listening to an ear piece. “They have the main road blocked off up ahead. We need an alternate route.”

Don hit a button on the dash, and a screen popped up with a navigation screen. “I told you it’s fully loaded.”

They weaved through side streets and alleyways until they finally reached the dealership.

“I quite like this car,” the woman said. “I hope you don’t mind cash.” She threw Don a stack of hundreds.

“Ok, um, yeah.” He got out and looked down into the window. “So… I’ll start the paperwork?”

The tires screeched as the car raced from the parking lot.

Don looked out over the car lot. He saw a man looking at a used, blacked out van they’d had on the lot for months. He straightened his tie and walked over to the man. “Work van, huh? She’ll do the job.”

The man looked at Don. “How many kids will fit in it?”

He had been waiting for answers now for 962 minutes. Even with each passing second, his nerves held steady. 963 minutes and his hands had already grown clammy again. *In five minutes, I'm going to go find the doctor myself,* he promised. 965 minutes, and with Nathan's newfound anxiety, he was starting to regret the vow he'd just made. 966 minutes. He wiped his hands again as two knocks sounded at the door. *Finally.* ""I'm decent, come in."" 

Dr. Martins entered wearing a stark white lab coat, pressed khakis, and polished black shoes. ""Hello Nate, how are you doing today?"" 

""I guess that depends on what you tell me,"" Nathan replied grumpily.
""Alright, I guess I'll just dive in then."" Dr. Martins pulled up a rolling stool as Nathan perked on the side of his bed. ""This is something the medical field has never seen before, so most of our prognosis is hypothetical at this point. When the lightning went through your body, it left a residue. We're not sure how to classify it at this point. It has many features that would allow us to call it bateria, so for now we will refer to it as such. From what we can tell based on your biopsy, this bacteria seems to cause deterioration and then rapid regrowth of cells. Now, eventual replacement of old cells with new is completely natural, but this disease is accelerating the process in a very methodical way. By our best estimate, it will reach your brain in approximately 30 days.""

Nathan let this information wash over. *I'm a medical phenomenon. One day they'll name this disease after me. Nathan Harper's Disease. The Harper...* 

""Okay, so if it's causing regeneration, that sounds like a good thing. Am I all set then?"" Nathan asked hopefully, but Dr. Martins shook his head.

""With much of your body, you won't notice much of a change. But once the disease enters the brain,"" Dr. Martins removed his glasses and looked Nathan in the eyes, ""we predict total memory loss, and possible changes to both mental capacity and personality.""

Nathan felt his mouth fall open as his mind went blank. Blackness pushed at the corners of his visions. His words came out as a breath rushed to live his betraying jerk of a body, ""Total memory loss?"" 

""I imagine this must be very hard to hear, and I'm happy to answer any questions you may have. We don't have much in the way of support groups for this particular disease, but we can assign you a hospital therapist to help you work through this."" 

Nathan sat staring at the clock for a full 6 minutes and 27 seconds. *Alright, it's time to say something, this is getting awkward. Martins is just staring at you. But jeez, all my memories, and personality, just gone? How do I live after that?*

Dr. Martins interrupted Nathan's inner monologue, ""I'm going to leave for a while and allow you to process this new information."" He took a business card out of a pocket in his lab coat and left it on Nathan's bedside table. ""Please call me if you want to discuss anything further before I come back. Otherwise, I'll be in touch soon,"" he said in a sympathetic tone as he rose from the stool and turned to leave.

""Can you cure it?"" Nathan said a little too loudly, allowing his fear to show. 

Dr. Martins opened turned to look over his shoulder and opened his mouth to answer, and paused before answering. ""This is all entirely novel. The short answer is, I don't know. I'm sorry,"" he added as he exited the room, leaving Nathan with his thoughts, which now seemed like a precious resource.

For the first 36 minutes, Nathan just focused on controlling his breathing and heart rate, knowing that they were just a symptom of a larger problem he had yet to get to. He then tried to get his hands to stop shaking, but after 8 minutes, gave up the fight and turned his attention to processing. 

*Well, at least I have 30 days left to enjoy my life. My meaningless, pathetic, video game-filled, parentally reliant, 27 year old life... I always wondered what I would do with the rest of my time if I was given a death sentence, but this is different somehow. I'll probably be alive after and still have to function at some human level. Will I retain any skills like language and social interaction? How much will I have to relearn?* Nathan stood in his socks and started pacing with a pattern on the tiled floor. *I have to start all over again! It's like when the dad turned off my xbox before I had a chance to save and I had to repeat all my progress. Well, I did get a better score the second time around.* He stopped pacing as a new thought dawned on him. *This means I have to start over. I get to start over. It's like I have an extra life and I can totally reinvent myself... Jeez I have a lot of planning and not a lot of time.*

Hands shaking in excitement instead of fear now, Nathan rushed to his messenger bag and extracted a blue spiral notebook and a pen. He began to sketch out a calendar, then jot out objectives in each day. Phrases like **Cardio Work**, **Increase Strength**, and **Brain Training** were scattered throughout his makeshift planner. Fueled by the thought of a better life, Nathan looked down at his work and smiled. He said aloud, ""Look out world, this nerd's got a cheat code.""",ladyoboe

[WP]",Bdawg555,"Even though Evan's face had turned red due to the constant crying, his quivering lips faintly drew a smile that contoured the shape of his unshaved beard. He felt his stomach aching with pain and hunger, but he didn't care.

While he was sitting on a small plastic chair fifteen minutes ago, a neatly groomed doctor stopped to ask him if he needed assistance, but Evan politely declined. He needed time to gather his thoughts. He felt tired and for a moment, the world didn't feel real. But after all, he couldn't give himself the privilege of being weak. As he slowly made his way into the hall of the hospital, he felt lightheaded, as if he was about to faint in any moment now, but he kept placing one foot in front of the other. 

His sweat-drenched hands slowly raised up the glass panel and left a small trace on it as he tried to support himself on it.
His eyes were clouding and he carefully wiped them clean as he tried to look inside the room.

He couldn't hold it. The tears drew a trace on his face once again as he saw the short,pale nurse opening up an incubator and carefully putting the baby on her arms as she smiled at the new-born. Evan felt his knees weakening for each step the nurse took towards him. The clean sound of the door opening beside him made his heart beat faster by the second inside his chest. When the nurse softly extended the baby for him to hold, he doubted for a second. He was afraid he'd drop the baby of how weak he felt, but he gathered his strength. Evan couldn't believe that he was holding his daughter in his very arms. Words tried to come out but a soft whisper was all that he managed to say at that moment. *She's beautiful*, he thought. 

''Just like your mom...'' Evan said while tears streamed down his eyes. ''Just as beautiful as she was...'' He choked on his own words as the nurse got closer to hold him near.

This was Evan's worst day in his life, but at the same time, it was the most blessed for him.

"A man has the unluckiest day in the world, but it turns into the best day of his life. [WP]",Bdawg555,"It had been a bad day for Jeremy. He had broken a finger that morning. Jammed it on the doorframe on the way to the bathroom. This was swiftly followed by tripping down the last couple of steps and hurting his knee. While at work he spilled hot coffee all over himself, and then his computer had an accidental factory reset, wiping all of his hard work for two weeks. His bosses told them that it was company policy to keep backups, and this was an act of gross misconduct. Then, as if to top it off like a great big cherry made out of human waste, he came home to find his dig had been stolen. As if sat there trying to figure out what to do, a report flashed up on the news. Apparently a man who lived in a nearby neighbourhood was being traced in connection with a series of child abductions. He turned up the volume, his bad day forgotten for an instant. This was a big story. The local news and water-cooler country had been a sombre season, trying to find different ways to truly not understand the reasoning behind such senseless acts ever since the first few reports weeks ago. Then the name was in the screen. His name. Jeremy Everyman. He got up to scream, panic, flail around, anything that would help. Then the sound rose from outside. The swell of people marching toward his house with pitchforks raised and nooses silloueted by torches and rage-filled screams of anguish. He ran into his garden, before a bright light hit him. A gargantuan flying saucer began to beam him on board, and he was soon greeted by strange creatures with large eyes and massive gloves. One of them leaned down and spoke in a strange tone, but with unmistakable kindess. It said that their people had evolved on a world where finger strength was directly linked to their political system, and you, Jeremy Everyman, have the exact bone structure required to lead their people, and all people across all galaxies. The break caused by that mornings careless arm movement had alerted the council of 8, as well as the two thumbs of greatness, residing in a quadrant of the universe far, far away.  The aliens had also beamed his dog aboard earlier, mistaking him for the ruler of all that is. It also turned out that the man they were looking for on the news also just happened to have the same name, and he didn't actually abduct them. He was saving them from abusive families themselves, and had a huge water park in his garden. And all the kids were fine. And his old workplace blew up as well. ",Seth_Leaveon
"[WP] As a successful author, you publish your second book, only to be sued... by yourself from a parallel universe for copyright infringement!?",BellLabs,"You have never seen yourself. That’s something that not many people tend to think about.

Sure, you’ve seen your reflection, but that’s distorted by your own perceptions. People say that if you were to ever meet yourself, you wouldn’t even recognise you, because your perception of yourself is so far removed from reality.

I pondered this as I sat across the long, oak table from myself, the other version of me dressed almost identically and scowling at me.

It seemed to me that I wasn’t terribly unattractive, short brown hair, thick black glasses and stubble. I’d never been able to grow a beard, I was glad this version of myself couldn’t either.

What was even stranger was that Other Me had chosen the exact same lawyer to represent his case, which meant there were now two pairs of identical looking people facing each other off across the boardroom of Linker and Thomas Law Llp.

“... Release date of 19th of August, three full days before the release of Sons of Diamond here,” Other Me’s lawyer, Edgar Thomas, said.

“Our release date was also the 19th of August,” Edgar Thomas, my Edgar Thomas, countered.

“Our world exists three days ahead of yours, though, right now, as we exist in Earth B-”

“I think you will find we are Earth A.”

“In Earth B, the date is September 9, but when we left the date in our world, the proper Earth, was September 12. This has remained a constant, so regardless of the date itself, in the grand scheme of the universe, our Sons of Diamond was released three days before yours, making it the official publication. My client deserves reparations.”

“Poppycock!” My Edgar said.

The whole situation was ridiculous of course, but the world was watching, so both men were in full lawyer mode. 

This was the first time a person had been sued by themselves, so it made for interesting news fodder.

I’d first gotten the letter three months prior. It was official, from the offices of Linker and Thomas Llp, which initially caused me some confusion.

I sat there and read it at my kitchen table with a coffee, my cat Shakespeare nuzzling at my bear feet slippers, with a blank look on my face.

'*Dear Mr Dormer, 
It has come to our attention that you have infringed our client’s copyright protected work. This infringement consists of the entire published text of the novel Sons of Diamond.*
 
'*Unfortunately, your actions unlawfully misappropriate and misuses our client’s original and creative work and deprives him of the benefits, privileges, and profits from the exclusive use of copyrighted material…*'

At first, I’ll be honest, I thought it was a joke. I certainly hadn’t infringed any copyright with Sons of Diamond. 

That book was essentially my life’s work, five years of research and redrafts, late night writing sessions fuelled by coffee and frantic back ups after I lost the first fifteen chapters to computer error.

Besides, it must have been a joke, or a mistake on Linker and Thomas’ end. My suspicions were affirmed when I noticed the date on the letter, two days ahead of the actual date.

I gave Shakespeare his breakfast and left him to eat it on the kitchen counter as I called Edgar Thomas on his private line, a privilege earned by years of keeping him on retainer.

“Think you might want to sack one of your secretaries,” I said jokingly. “You should read this letter I got this morning-”

“It’s not a joke, Al,” Ed had said to me.

I remember letting out a dry chuckle.

“I think I’d remember suing myself, Ed.”

Only it wasn’t me, of course, that morning their office had received a call (from their own secretary, no less) claiming that Sons of Diamond was in fact an infringement of their client’s novel. I was suing myself.


Science fiction will tell you that the breaking down of the walls of reality will be a huge event, a cataclysmic, apocalyptic and fiery end to humanity’s brief existence.

Apparently, that’s a lie, and I can tell you that for certain. There was nothing science fiction about our first meeting with the parallel Alan Dormer and Edgar Thomas.

They simply drove up to the offices of Linker and Thomas Llp in a blacked out Lexus and met us with disdainful handshakes. No apocalypse, no cataclysm, just business.

Then the arguing began. The parallel me argued that I’d ripped him off because, thanks to a quirk in the space-time continuum, his world ran just slightly ahead of mine, meaning his book had technically been published first.

My Ed argued there was no precedent for quirks of the space time continuum and the only thing that mattered was the legal, official release dates, which were identical. Even for me, someone who grew up with pulp sci-fi and Asimov, it was a difficult argument to follow.

They also weren’t happy with having to have the meetings on our Earth, as any judge was likely to have a bias towards his home universe.

In the end, it was decided that since there was nothing normal about the situation to begin with, it wouldn’t hurt to break away from the norm, and it became solely a jury trial, six people from Earth A and six people from Earth B.


Whilst the situation was extremely stressful, it was also fascinating in a way. The Other Alan Dormer was almost identical to me, but there were subtle little differences.

I had a little scar on my chin, a cycling accident from when I was eleven, and he didn’t. I wondered what the logic behind it was. I wondered if he had spent five years desperately trying to get his first novel published, surviving on ramen noodles and cheap whiskey. If he had, it made his anger understandable. I’d be pissed off if I found out someone had ripped off my life’s work, too.


The day of the trial came, and the courthouse was packed with journalists, scientists, sociologists, psychologists, and one lonely janitor taking his lunch break.

With no judge, the trial was overseen by the bailiff, who simply called testimony from both sides and announced what little evidence there was to the jury, who sat on either side of the court.

Other Alan’s testimony was full of fire and brimstone, he was a much better public speaker than I was. I found myself thinking about what must be so different in his world for him to have such mastery of it.

The whole thing was absurd, and when I was called to give testimony, I didn’t have much to say on the matter.

“I don’t remember ripping anyone off,” I said. “I started writing Sons of Diamond after my wife died. She’d always urged me to write, so I did it for her. I just woke up with the idea in my head one day.”

I felt the eyes of Other Alan watching me carefully. I wondered what he was thinking.

Then, the recess came whilst the jury were sent out to consider their verdict. I sat with Ed, separate from the press and the other counsel.

“What happens if we lose?” I asked.

Ed shrugged.

“We have to pay up, but we can appeal. I’m not even sure how you can transfer funds to a parallel world. It’s 
not like you can just send it Western Union.”

I frowned. 

Then the door opened; through it stepped me, eyes tired, and red, like… like he’d been crying.

“We shouldn’t be talking,” Ed said. I said it was fine and waved him away.

Other Me sat next to me and sighed, removing a book from his suit pocket, a first edition of Sons of Diamond.

“That thing you said about your wife. Eleanor?”

“Yes,” I replied. “Eleanor Blake.”

Other Me nodded.

“In this world she died of cancer before you wrote Sons of Diamond?” Other Me asked.

“Yes,” I said again. “Ovarian cancer, it was already stage three when they discovered it. We only had months afterwards.”

I could not read my counterpart’s expression, I did not know what my own facial features looked like in conversation, so he, I, was hard to analyse.

“It didn’t happen like that for me,” Other Me said. “They discovered it earlier. There was an… experimental treatment. She went into remission and we had five more years together. Five years to… write this.”

He handed me the book and I took it. It felt no different physically than my edition, no lighter, but there was a different aura to it.

“Read the last page,” Other Me said.

I obliged, but said nothing, scrolling to the last page. I didn’t recognise it.

“In your version, Michael ends up alone, he’s lost everyone. I had that version in mind too, but Eleanor changed my mind. Said it was too lonely, too devoid of emotion. I changed it.”

I felt a tear in my eye, and it trickled down my cheek and splash landed on the page, left of the final full stop. It revealed more text on the next page, so I looked overleaf.

*'For Eleanor, it said, thank you for changing my mind. This book is infinitely better for it.'*

I was smiling, and Other Me was smiling too.

“They aren’t the same,” he said. “I’m withdrawing my claim. These are very different books, from people with different experiences.”

Handing the book back to him, I smiled.

“Thank you,” I said.

We never did find out the jury’s verdict, although years later one or two claimed in the press they were planning to throw the case out.

The walls between worlds remained open, even though many scientists worried about the effects it might be having on both worlds. People didn’t care, in the parallel world to theirs, loved ones were still alive, opportunities long gone could be rekindled.

It was Other Me’s idea to collaborate, the first book written by two separate but completely identical people. It did very well, the Daughters of Diamond, both critically and commercially.

After that, he went home, and we never wrote a sequel. Sometimes we will send each other letters, but we remain in our respective worlds, as it should be.

It was a strange experience all round, but one I am infinitely better for.",EilrahcNotneb

[EU] [It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia] The Gang gets Superpowers.,Budobudo,"Mac, Charlie, Dennis and Dee grumbled around the bar, with Frank putting away a shot of bourbon nearby. Mac washed a cup in the sink behind the bar and shook his head. ""The thing's dick is totally made out of rock. Every inch of skin is made out of rock, right?""

""Why do you have to constantly bring the uh, topic of conversation back to the Thing's penis?"" Charlie scratched at his beard, itching away at the lice that had made their home there in recent days. ""I mean- Mac, seriously, holy shit, can I get like, some kind of -"" He let out an exasperated sigh and continued to scratch away.

""You are absolutely disgusting. You're tracking in parasites, Charlie! Where did you get lice? Is it lice? Fleas?"" Dennis crossed his arms and gestured at Charlie's filthy form. ""I can't - You know, I just can't make heads or tails of you sometimes.""

""It may have been when I was huffing spray paint with Rickety Cricket.""

Dee gasped in disgust, as did the others. ""Oh my god, Charlie, you've been hanging out with Rickety Cricket? Why?""

""Hey, I don't ask you what you're doing swinging that long bird neck of yours all over town, I can have friends outside of you guys!""

Dennis, Mac and Frank laughed as Dee frowned. ""He's got you there, Bird! You have a long neck!"" Frank coughed and stumbled up to his feet, making his way over to the bar. ""Anyway, what were you guys talking about before this?""

""I don't know. What were we talking about?"" Dennis asked the others.

""Superhero movies. We were talking about how great that new Fantastic Four movie was."" Charlie scraped his chin with his dirty nails as he spun on his stool to face Frank. 

""And I was merely positing a fact about one of the characters.""

The front door flew open. A man in a heavy duty HAZMAT suit, flanked by two others, entered the bar, each of them holding Geiger counters and various tools.
The Gang rose a fuss - various exclamations of shock, yammering on as they do.
""I need you all to stay calm. A hazardous waste truck crashed just a half block away and now there's worry that there's radiological contaminants in the city. We need to establish this bar as a screening area while we evacuate the city.""

""Radiation? Like, uh, mutations?""

The HAZMAT operator motioned for FEMA workers to enter the building. ""Uh. Y- Possibly, over -""

""AWESOME!"" Mac pumped a fist.

""Like hell, bozo! I want me some superpowers. What about you guys?"" Mac grinned and turned to the others, who wishy-washy shrugged and gave various nods and agreeances.

""I could go for some superpowers. Think about it, Frank! We could do that thing we talked about, sorta!"" Charlie piped in. Frank washed his mouth with his hand and shook his head, cutting his throat with a gesture to silence the bar's janitor.

""No, no, that's not proper conversation for here.""

""Well, come on, Frank, what is Charlie talking about?"" Dee chirped. Frank sighed.

""It's just some stupid thing that we were daydreaming about.""

Philadelphia, overcast with a heavy thunderstorm by night. In the shadows of an alleyway, a masked vigilante in a heavy trench coat stepped into the light of a streetlamp, a black balaclava over his round face. Across the street, a handful of Vietnamese elderly men rattle dice against the wet concrete ground. Removing a revolver from his jacket, the short vigilante shouts. ""You try to cheat the Mantis, you get the claws!"" He opened fire-

""Woah, woah, woah, hold on, what the hell, Frank? How much of this is - You want to shoot vietnamese people?""

""No, not ALL Vietnamese people, just those rat bastards that cheated me at our last game. I mean, how do you get snake eyes twice? They must have given me bad dice, can you believe that shit?"" Frank coughed and sputtered, taking another drink from his bottle of bourbon.

""See, that doesn't sound very superheroic."" Mac shook his head. ""That sounds sort of hate crimey. Do you guys think it sounds hate crimey?"" 

""Please, PLEASE listen to me, the air has traces of high-grade toxic waste, we really need to -""

""Hold on, prick! Why don't you just shut up already?"" Dee turned to the scientists as they filed into the room, setting up various equipment. ""I-"" She coughs, ""You're really butting in here with our conversation, ass prick!""

""So - Fine, what would YOU do with superpowers, Mac?""

Mac scratched his chin. The world swam - and Mac pulled on a domino mask and stepped up to the corner of a roof, his eyes scanning the city for trouble. He was absolutely ripped, and his skin-tight supersuit reached almost Rob Liefeld levels of insanity. A golden, gleaming cross over his chest, a utility belt with nunchucks and various martial art weaponry..

A distant shout. Bounding acrobatically down the side of the building and swinging with a cross-shaped grappling gun, Mac landed with a flourish in the midst of a gang's attempt to rob a man. With a quick flip, he took one of the gangsters out with a flying kick, before effortlessly doing battle with the others with various kicks, chops and punches, each with a loud and exuberant ""BAM! BIFF! WHAM!"" sound effect. After all the gangsters lie unconscious or injured, the robbery victim steps forward.

""My hero!"" The man claps and grins. Mac steps forward and leans in and-

""What- What's going on? What-"" Dennis spoke up, shaking his head.

""I was going to use my grappling line to bring him to the roof. Come on, it's like, in all the Batman movies!""

""uh. Like.. I don't even know where to begin with this."" Dennis pinched the bridge of his nose.

""Well, how do you see YOURSELF with superpowers?""

Dennis raised a brow. ""Me? .. Me? Oh. Uh.. Well, you see, Mac, I've actually put a lot of thought into this, and as a man with some understanding of how the justice system works and in particular how to avoid capture from the police, I have to say that I'd do a better job than Hate Crime Reynolds over here and whatever you were doing.""

""Oh yeah? Tell us."" Charlie coughed.

A dark underground tunnel flickered with failing fluorescent lights.  A rough-looking thug stumbled in the dark, his face painted with fear. Heavy footsteps in the shadows behind him. ""No, no! Stay away! Please, I'm sorry! I'm so sorry! I'll never do it again!"" The footsteps continued. As the thug stumbled into the light, he was soon followed by Dennis - his head wrapped in a crude saran wrap mask, his hands protected by rubber kitchen gloves. ""No, stay- Stay away!"" The thug tripped over his heels. Dennis straddled the man's hips and grasped his throat with his hands.

The thug clawed and scratched, gasping for air. ""No-"" He wheezed. 

""I AM A GOLDEN GOD! I AM A GOLDEN GOD!"" Dennis shouted in the man's face as tears welled in the criminal's eyes-

Dennis merely smiled and rubbed his neck. The gang murmured uncomfortably. ""What about you, Dee? I imagine your powers would be like, bullying men or something, perhaps something bird related?""

Dee coughed. ""Uh, no. I don't know. I don't really know too much about superheroes. I've, haha, if you can imagine it, I've got a social life, you know? I don't spend all day on the internet writing superhero fan fiction or cataloging my cards or whatever-the-fuck nerds do these days."" She laughed.

""You- what? A social life? Since when?"" Mac snapped at her. The gang laughed. Charlie coughed. 

Deeandra Reynolds' eyes went bloodshot, her muscles tensed and expanded. Soon a towering colossus, she chased down the gang as they fled, tearing them limb from limb. Mac was smashed into the floorboards, Dennis was crushed in Dee's hands, Charlie was impaled with a mop and Frank was slammed against the floor like a ragdoll. Bloody and victorious, Dee roared- 

""It's funny because you don't do anything!"" Charlie pointed at the blonde's face and laughed. 

""Oh, screw you, Charlie! You know what? You know what? What would YOU do if you had superpowers? Your social life is hanging out with Frank and us, how am I any different?""

""Because I - No, I hang out with Rickety Cricket and other guys too! And my superpowers would be the absolute best, you know? You guys, imagine.."" He waved his hands about, and reached into his coat, after coughing, to remove a sketchbook from a coat. Opening it- 

The world was a cartoonish, crayon-sketched comic. Charlie pulled on a technologically advanced helmet and costume and summoned up a speeding car with a rat motif. Rolling over the hood and into the front seat, he summoned his sidekick - Frank, in a mouse costume - and the two sped down the streets of the city. Drifting to a stop, Charlie flipped out and to his feet. An explosion! Smoke billowed out of the First Bank of Philadelphia, and dozens of highly trained hounds carried out bags of money - and their master made themselves soon apparent! Rickety Cricket, the Dog Master! Shirtless, burned and malformed, the man scratched at his ringworm and cackled malevolently, before sicking his dogs on Ratman and Mouse! 

Thinking quickly, and using his rat-head shaped helmet, he summoned a sea of rats from the sewers, from apartment buildings and a nearby daycare. The rats swarmed the dogs and the street, soon defeating Rickety Cricket and his Roving Rovers! 

Charlie drummed his hands on the bartop and sang. ""AND THEN HE SAVES THE DAAAAY!"" 

""Wow. I - What is this?"" Mac spun the sketchbook. ""This is all nonsense. I can't even make out what you drew here, there's like, sketches in the liner and - What?""

""It's Ratman and Mouse! What Frank and I were talking about doing with all the money he has!""

""We didn't really talk about it. You got high on paint and came in and yelled it at me!""

""Psh, come on, no, come on, okay."" Charlie waved Frank off.

""You know, Superpowers would be really cool. Hey, Science Dork!""

The HAZMAT worker glanced up from his computer. The bar was now a bustling lab of workers and technicians. ""What.""

""Are we getting superpowers?""

""No. You're getting lymphoma in 10 years.""

The gang uncomfortably looked at one another.

 

Far outside of the neighborhood, in a local landfill, Rickety Cricket crawled out of the trash-bag he'd been sleeping in and through a yellowish puddle of toxic waste. Easing up to a stand, the man scratched himself, then checked his supply of inhalants. Finding nothing, the man turned- And saw a can of spraypaint standing on a distant rusted out car. 

Reaching out, the man pulled it over into his hand with some invisible force. With a surprised stare, the former priest scratched his chin, then took a huff of spray paint.


",lordmalifico
[EU] [It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia] The Gang gets Superpowers.,Budobudo,"Charlie woke with a start, he reached around for the can of cat food but it was no where to be found, he got up and walked toward the window, it was crazy bright outside. He turned to wake Frank but he was gone, maybe to get more cat food. Slowly Charlie's eyes adjusted to the brightness, it wasn't outside it was in, more specifically it was him! He grabbed some clothes and ran to the bar lighting up the night as he ran...

Meanwhile Mac woke with a shudder he felt a sudden chill come over him, with silent steps he rose from his bed and strolled across the apartment, something about the night sky was calling to him ""sssseeeeee ya Dennissss ""  he hissed as he left.

Dee wiped down the bar as the last regular shuffled out the door, she was pissed at the guys for leavin her run the bar again as they ran another scheme, this time stealing toxic waste from the factories to sell to the indian restraunt that had opened down the street, clearly terrorists operating under the cover of a restraunt. The guys came in briefly stinking of shit and shouting at each other, apparently Dennis crashed into some piece of shit car and covered everyone in goo. Suddenly a thought struck Dee, she grabbed her keys and ran out to the kerb. "" God damn it "" she screamed as she saw her car mangled and sitting in a pool of crap which now covered her shoes as she ran to Charlie's place.

Dennis awoke at 8am, he rose as normal and made his way to the bathroom to try, as he did everyday, to take a shit. After a few minutes he rose and turned on the shower, as he did he caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror, he was solid gold from head to toe. Smiling, he reached for a pack of condoms "" lets see that bitch say no this"" he muttered as he left not bothering to lock up or indeed get dressed.

Frank found himself under the bridge which for some reason seemed much bigger than usual. He tried to stand up but couldn't, or was he standing already? He looked around, his pants and glasses were beside him also much bigger than usual, looking at his hands Frank saw that they were small and young looking, but green , like those of a boy, a frog boy! ""Oh shit "" he croaked, then out of the corner of his eye he saw a snail slowly slither along a railing; was it him or was the snail familiar somehow?, he licked his lips and shot out his tongue quickly catching the snail and sucking it in "" hmm salty"".

"[WP] ""Keeping up with the Joneses? You can't handle the Joneses!""",Castriff,"Terry threw down his briefcase bag, ""James has a friggin' laser gun on Theodore.""

""His shark? Well, I'm just impressed it works!"" Meredith said walking towards her husband. They'd been married for a few years now but after fighting up from the brink of poverty and somehow getting into the neighborhood of their dreams, they'd run into true rivals- James and Renee Jones.

""No that means I have to get something for Tobbie or we're going to hear about it at the picnic. Not two years Meredith! I won't have his pet embarrass ours two years in a row,"" Terry walked through the house out into the garage. Tobbie barked directly into a hole he'd dug around the apple tree. After catching a whiff of his favorite owner, he left the tree to its own devices and ran to the man. He jumped and scratched at Terry's legs. ""Well, hey there buddy. You ready for an upgrade?""

""Woof!""

""What'd you think- a new collar or maybe some fancy new paw pads?"" Tobbie barked at the mention of paw pads. He likely didn't actually understand but just in case, Terry took his vote seriously. They walked into the garage where lights flickered on as the motion sensor was triggered. Tobbie bolted through a small dog door just to the right of the real door.

Terry grabbed a few pieces of fabric, some LED lights, a small raspberry pi chip he'd used to augment Tobbie's collar last year and small propulsion jets. Tobbie and Terry would teach Jeremy and his water breathing pet a thing or two.

Terry called into work the following day, he'd made too much progress to stop now. Tobbie had filled the room with noxious fart smells but even that didn't make him take a break- Tobbie was going to be Iron Pugg. ""Alright...come here Tobbie!"" Terry called, kneeling to the pug's level. He slipped the thin booties on the puppy and backed away. ""Tobbie, sit...good boy, now lay down- activate!"" The booties slowly rose Tobbie to Terry's eye level- no shark with a laser could beat this. Terry threw a leash around his dog and walked him out the human door.

Meredith dropped the plate she was washing. This was why she never did the dishes- if Terry didn't have a chore to distract him he came up with all kinds of things to distract her; that's how plates break. ""How did you- nevermind, I don't want to know. Now you have to figure out a way to keep him off ALL the furniture.""

""That won't be a problem,"" Terry dropped the leash letting Tobbie fly free. His box of milkbones was sitting on the counter, the dog scrambled towards them. ""Off,"" the boots slowly reduced in power and changed from a bright neon blue to a dim orange until finally turning off as Tobbie's paws found something to press against. ""The boots are pressure sensitive so when they feel their repulsor beams coming back, pressing back on the pads, they start to turn off. Or when you say off. I'll work on what to do when we aren't here but it's not like he can activate them himself,"" Terry scratched the slobbering pug behind the ears.

""The party starts in just a few hours- I picked out a nice little suit for you upstairs.""

""I hate suits.""

""The Joneses are wearing a suit and a sundress that, in my opinion, shows a bit too much-"" Meredith laid her hands flat and bounced them at chest level.

""No doubt, she was a cheerleader back in the day. He's a job thief and she's the woman girls love to hate- perfect couple.""

""With the perfect dim-witted pet."" With that, Terry went upstairs and began getting ready. The time flew by; Terry washed Tobbie and reapplied his boots, careful to not fry or cross any wires. The dog barely flinched as Terry cleaned between his toes and pulled adhesive on and off. 

The picnic was the usual spread- you could tell the dishes the Joneses had made because of the gold embossed china laying about on the freshly constructed picnic tables and the pristinely shiny grill he had hopefully spent all night polishing. Terry smeared a fingerful of mustard on the back end of it just because he could.

James was off on the other side of the pool with the Mavins, a stern but mentally empty ex-baseball coach and his wife, another cheerleader. James tossed a piece of bloody hamburger into the pool and a thrashing grey bubble devoured it instantly. ""Hey, Terry get over here!""

A small flash of red light shot up through the water, it was on. ""Tobbie, come here boy,"" Terry patted his leg. The adorable little bustle of fur bounced over. Together they walked towards the villain of the story, fire shot up from the now stained grill as the enemies neared.

""This is Theodore- he's got a new laser beam to keep the birds away,"" James said, raising his glass to cheer himself on such a naive accomplishment.

""Right, for the birds. Well, I fashioned a new toy for Tobbie. He's been getting a little too good at fetch lately so I figured I'd up his game, activate!"" Tobbie rose to the occasion. Finally at eye level with the man beyond the fence and sensing his owner's dismay, Tobbie began to growl. 

""Woah there killer, that is pretty nifty Terry. What, did that take you a few months to make or...?""

""A day."" Tobbie flew towards the man, knocking the drink out of his hand. The pug pulled up just before impact, it was a warning shot. A blast shot out from the water, Theodore the Shark didn't mess around.

""Theo's awfully mad about a flying dog. That's just unnatural. But I do confess, it's a rather delightful toy. What's the functionality, though, can he clean the drink off my shirt?""

""No, but he can pee in a hole- like a toilet- especially one as dirty as...your mouth!"" Terry pointed at James' mouth; Tobbie aimed his leg up and hit his mark beautifully.

""Get...out! Get out, get out, get out!"" James screamed. Renee came running, one breast already fighting out of her shirt. She wrestled it back in with little heed to what others might think.

""What's wrong baby?""

""We lost...to those damn Smiths again!""

"[WP] As people begin receiving their Oculus Rift VR headsets and entering VR for the first time, something very strange and unexpected happens.",Chaoss86,"""Get in as soon as you finish setting up, dude. We're all waiting for you,"" Stan tells me on the phone. I end the call and put my cell down beside my computer, fans whirring as the software finally completes installation and the last few updates begin. My hands twitch excitedly as I hold the gadget in my hands and plug it into the USB port along with a controller. Finishing the install, I load the special preorder disc my friends and I had all gotten from our small local computer store. Taking my glasses off, I wrap the Rift around my head into a comfortable position and my heart begins to flutter as the menu for the game appears in front of me against a black backdrop.

With my controller I select ""New Profile"", and a character creator appears in front of me. Naturally - as addicted as I am to customization options - I indulge myself for a while in the creator until I've fashioned myself a human character that's a near-identical copy of my own appearance. Except more muscular, of course. I save my character and select the multiplayer option. Linking my Facebook account to the game, I'm able to join their session. I find myself dropped into some sort of summery forest clearing, with two other avatars of which I can recognize the usernames as belonging to my friends.

""Ooh now I see why Adrian took so long, he was wasting time on the character creator,"" says a short male dwarf with Stan's voice. He gives me some sort of crude programmed gesture in my direction which indicates to me what he spent his time figuring out in the game.

""My bad, you know I can't help myself. Is the whole gang here? Have we started any quests?"" I ask him as I look around at everyone's faces and inspect the forest. Life-like birds chirp and soar in above rustling trees, the leaves as crisp and sharp as the real ones had been the first time I had gotten my  eyeglasses.

""Yeah, I think we're actually the only ones on the game's servers at the moment. And no to the quest, we held off of the quest until you got here,"" says Lori as a hologram-like menu screen appears in front of her elf character. ""Well most of us. Dominic went ahead and began a quest having to do with a volcano or something. I don't blame him though, this place looks crazy awesome and he waited the longest. Like two hours until the rest of us got in. Here, I chose a quest called ""Into the Nest"", it's the closest one to us.""

She marks a waypoint on her map and a pillar of pale light shoots from the ground into the sky, above the trees half a mile away. We begin to trek over there and arrive at a circular pit in the ground, the size of a hula hoop. Jumping in one after the other, our avatars slide down a claustrophobic tunnel and I feel a rush of adrenaline as I  feel like I am actually *there* experiencing the winding descent and hearing the others scream with excitement. We eventually plop out at an enormous underground cavern, complete with stalactites dripping water from the ceiling.

""That was wicked, wonder what we have to do here?"" Stan asks us before we hear a knock on his bedroom door. ""Crap, one second guys, I'm going to mute my microphone, my dad's coming into the room. I've got to see what he wants to talk about."" Stan's avatar becomes motionless and the symbol of a muted microphone appears above his head.

Lori and I walk around the cavern as we wait for him to return, finding colourful mushrooms and the skeletal remains of bats. As we add some of these things to our inventory, then turn our characters's heads around when we hear a scuffling noise briefly echo from somewhere farther in the cave. Just then, we hear Stan's microphone unmute.

""Guys, my dad just told me something just happened to Dom. His mom found him with third degree burns on his arms and hands an hour ago,"" he says.

""Oh my god! What happened?"" Lori gasps.

""Not sure yet. Apparently his mom found him screaming in pain, still playing the game,"" Stan tells us. ""He lost consciousness when they brought him into the ambulance.""

""Wait, Stan, we were at Dom's house last night, I don't think there was anything in his room he could have burned both hands with, could he?"" I ask, but while he kickstarts his memory, I look at the online log of players in my menu. I can still see all of our names and healthbars, including Dominic's on a separate map: The Volcano.  

""I don't want to jump to conclusions, but his character is very close to death and is suffering from a burn affliction too. Guys, I really think there's something wrong with this game,"" I say nervously.

Lori screams and our avatars turn towards her. She's pointing her avatar towards an opening in the cavern where a colossal centipede emerges, the elongated mandibles snapping. It scuttles over to her in a flash, injecting its poison claw into her elven torso. I can hear her shrill voice ringing in my ear with sincerity. There's no doubt the pain is real. 

I try to exit the game but I can't. There's no exit option in the menu and I can't remove the headset either. I can hear Stan running through the cavern trying to escape but I can't even move.

"[WP] As people begin receiving their Oculus Rift VR headsets and entering VR for the first time, something very strange and unexpected happens.",Chaoss86,"When I first turned my Oculus Rift on I had high expectations.  I wanted to be impressed, blown away, awed beyond belief. What I had not expected was a blinding and painful white light to consume my vision and hurt my eyes. Even less expected was the fact that, no matter how hard I tried, the headset would not be removed. I closed my eyes in an attempt to avoid the light but it persisted; if someone had walked into my room right then they probably would have seen the light coming through my skull it was that strong. 

I didn't expect the light to stop so quickly either. As suddenly as it had started the white light bled away completely,  leaving me in an inky black darkness.  The headgear still wouldn't come off. 

VOICE_COMMANDS_ACTIVE

Blinked on and off in front of my eyes which was strange in itself because the Oculus system didn't have any voice interface technology, and to my knowledge none had been added, that sort of thing would have been all over the news and I would have heard about it. After investing so much money into the Oculus I wouldn't have let such a drastic change float under my radar. 

ACTIVATE_TOTAL_IMMERSION?

""The fuck is total immersion? Let me out of this thing so I can report it as a faulty project!"" I yelled in response to the new blinking words. 

VOICE_COMMAND_NOT_RECOGNISED

SWITCHING_TO_YES_DEFAULT

Before I could reply the feeling of weightlessness took over. I imagined it must have been similar to the feeling a skydiver gets the minute the enter free fall after jumping out of a moving airplane, and much like in that scenario I couldn't help feeling like a grizzly end was on its way. Thay was only heightened by the sharp, stabbing pain I felt at the back of my head.

Colour blossomed out of the darkness, browns and whites and blues and greens streaking across my vision before coalescing into the forms of fantasy creatures and buildings. I would have been in awe had I not known the game I had booted up to test my Oculus was a strictly sci-fi affair, no wizards or knights allowed.  

Surprisingly this mystery game was the least of my concerns. I brought my hand up to my head and instead of feeling the Oculus system on my face I instead felt skin, and hair, and a nose that was far too long to be my own. The breeze tickled my skin and a peculiar scent of cooking meat trickled up my nose. Around me stood other characters all looking equally confused. A fantasy MMO then, rather cliché.  

""Welcome,  ladies and gentleman,  to Virtuosa- a virtual world now to become your home!"" Boomed a loud, commanding voice from above the steadily panicking din. ""I am the game master of this world and today you will all be involved in all. .. experiment of sorts.""

The speaker was standing at the top of a tall brick tower in the center of castle and though he did not use a megaphone his voice was easy enough for all to hear. He wore a long white lab coat, nerdy thick rimmed glasses and smiled in the fashion only a predator would be able to master. 

""This is Total Immersion. A simulation that extracts your very conciousness out of your body and places it within a virtual avatar. You can do anything while you're in here, and I can do anything to your bodies in the outside world!""

The conversations, which had died down, flared up once more with renewed vigour and fear. 

""You see the Oculus project was... a scam of sorts. I commissioned its design for one very special reason... while your minds are all in here I will be using your bodies to, well, TAKE OVER THE WORLD!""

"[WP] You live your life, and after you die, you wake up in a room surrounded by people you don't know and holding a bong. They ask you if it worked.",Chumanix,"Tears and ink mingle on the page, my fevered thoughts gushing out of the pen only to smeared again into illegible oblivion. What a perfect metaphor for the exercise in futility that is human existence. I heave one last grunt of frustration before grabbing a fist-full of my would-be suicide-note, crushing it and tossing it aside. I am unable to write but I am resolved to never be unable again. My last act will defy my nature. My last act will finally put me in control of my ending. I pick up the revolver from my desk and shove it deep into my mouth. Finally in control. Three. Two. One.

“Did it work?”

Something isn’t right. I shouldn’t be here. Where is the nothing I was promised?

“Well?”

I open my eyes and hazily make out half a dozen faces. Teenage boys, all white as ghosts. I look down and see my own skin, once wrinkled and chestnut-colored, now smooth and pale and sickly. I’m one of them. I open my mouth to ask, “what are we?” but I can’t find my voice. My head is pounding. What the fuck did that bullet do to my head?

“Dude, he is wrecked.”

One of the boys reaches out toward me. 

“My turn,” he says. He takes something out my hand. I was holding something? I squint and realize he’s grabbed a bong from me. I open my mouth to say, “don’t!” but I really can’t find my voice. He rips it and his expression goes vacant. 

“So how was your trip?”

\* * * * * * * * * *

“Five months and I still can’t get it out of my head, man.” 

Just me and Derek sitting on the floor of my basement, smoking good old fashioned weed this time. 

“Yeah, I’m not trying that shit again. Was a good experience, but way too intense, you know? Crazy how it’s still legal. Pigs’ll probably come sniffing around for it the moment it’s on their radar, though.”

“I still... I just...” 

“What, dude? I know you had a bad trip and all but you gotta get over it. You been such a downer since then.”

I take a hit from the bowl and pass it. That night five months ago, little by little my memories came trickling back to me. And little by little my memories of that fucked up trip fade away. I can’t shake the ending though. It was so real. I was that guy. That old fucker, all ready to kill himself. I felt everything he felt. I knew every reason he did what he did. Who was he? Who even am I?

“Yeah, sorry. I’ll try to lighten up.”

I can’t shake it. His death wish – my death wish – keeps swimming back into my head, hungry to eat away at everything I thought I was before the trip. 

“I gotta go to the bathroom.” 

I get up and creep down the hallway. If my parents find out I’m still awake they’ll freak. I slowly open the door to the bathroom to stop it from creaking so much, get in and lock the door behind me. I take a piss and wash my hands. I splash some cold water on my face too. 

Then I see my dad’s safety razor in its stand next to the sink. Every day for the last five months I’ve looked at that razor and relished the thought of slicing up my wrists and leeching out all this weirdness that’s been lurking inside my body since that night. I look in the mirror and see my face but it’s not my own. I grab the razor, twist off the clasps and take out the blade. I gently prick my cheek and see a tiny droplet of blood pooling up. I feel no pain. This isn’t my face. It never has been. I’m gonna do it this time. I’m finally gonna do it. Starting in... Three. Two. One.

“Did it work?”

No, no, no. Not again. Is this some kind of cruel joke?

“Well?”

I open my eyes to glaring white fluorescent lights. After a moment of adjusting I see I’m in a doctor’s office. I’m surrounded by doctors and nurses in surgical masks. I must have survived my suicide attempt. My parents are probably gonna make me pay for the grout in the bathroom. 

I look at my arms. Still white but hairier. Not a scratch on them. No, no, no. 

“You must still be coming to grips with what you’ve just experienced,” one of the doctors says. “Allow me to explain. You are a pioneer. Years from now people will remember you the way we remember Neil Armstrong. You, the first man to have lived inside a simulated reality!”

The first? That seems doubtful to me. I’ve lived in two already. Surely they aren’t so terribly uncommon. 

“Well?”

My heart is heavy with dread. What if this is all there is? What if there’s no nothingness after all? Is it turtles all the way down?

“How does it feel?” The doctor asks.

“Iterative.” I say. The room fills with laughter. ",cygne
"[WP] You live your life, and after you die, you wake up in a room surrounded by people you don't know and holding a bong. They ask you if it worked.",Chumanix,"My eyes jumped open, and I let out an audible gasp. I could suddenly feel my arms, my legs, my everything. It was all there. But where was I?

As soon as my eyes adjusted to the darkness of the room, I began to survey my surroundings. Several others were sitting in the small space with me, and they all looked at me strangely. I recognized none of them, but I knew from their eyes that they recognized me. It was then I noticed I was holding something, and I looked down at my hands.

A bong. There was a bong in my hand. Great.

""Well, did it work?""

The question came from an older man sitting directly across from me. He seemed off as he asked the question, like he was holding in laughter as he said the words.

""Where am I?"" 

I couldn't really figure out how to say anything else. I was in shock, just like any other person should've been. Last I knew, I was driving down the road to get home from work when another car slammed into mine, crushing my entire body in a split second of pain.

""Dude, you come here all the time! It's just our regular hangout. You alright?"" 

This time, the question came from someone else. Another man, younger, was sitting right next to me. He had the same off way of speaking that the other man had as he spoke; he was hiding something.

""You must've had a bad trip or something, I guess."" The man added. Everyone around me nodded, some looking like they were about to burst from laughter. I could feel myself frown in confusement. Was this funny? 

""I- I don't understand where I am. I don't know this place!"" I tripped on my words, feeling angry and scared at the same time. I dropped the bong on the floor, and stood up quickly.

The others couldn't hold it in anymore. They b
urst out laughing, and stood up along with me. As they did, my surroundings transformed into a bright paradise. They changed too; their ragged, dirty clothes faded and white, glowing robes replaced them. I was frozen now, too freaked out to do anything but watch in a mix of terror and awe. 

The older man who spoke to my first walked over to me and placed a hand on my shoulder. Once he could contain his laughter, he looked me in the eye.

""You should've seen your face! Wow, we got you good! That's something the Angels and I like to do whenever someone dies, just to see how they react. It's pretty fun! Anyway, welcome to heaven."" He let out another chuckle before continuing. ""I'm God!""",Ventusai

John took a second to let it all sink in. There was a TV on the far side of the room blaring on about a hockey game. No one was watching it, though. “Uh, yeah. Remind me again, what did you say it would do?”. His voice sounded strange to him. It *felt* strange, like he had rubbed down the inside with lemon juice. He could feel the sting of peppermint in his nostrils.

“Extend perceptions, man. Stretch yer thoughts.”

He looked at the pothead with the beard who was wearing some silly, Russian fur hat. John still felt like he was on his back in a hospital room with an IV in his arm, slowly shitting himself to death. No, scratch that, he knew with utter certainty that he was dead. He *had* died. At the thought, his left hand reflexively clenched around small, childlike fingers that weren't there. “Uh, yeah. You could say it did that.”

“What did you see? Was it like a rainbow, or was it more like some kind of epiphany or something.”

He wanted to hit people. He wanted to shout at them. He wanted to run up to their face and say, “My life is and was not a God damn drug-addled mirage!”. And maybe he would've, if an image didn't leap to the front of his mind. He stopped and swallowed his anger, ashamed. “She wouldn't have wanted that,” he thought to himself, “that's not who I am.” He thought over his words carefully, chewing them slowly in his head like he’d often had to. He spoke the only words it felt right to say at the time: “I feel... old.”

“Hey, Beef, didn't you say this shit would make you euphoric or something? He sounds depressed.”

“That's what the guy said. He said something about a trip around the world. I dunno, maybe I should try to get a refund.”

“Yo, you paid money for that shit?”

“If you don't mind,” John interjected, “I think I'd like to take a step outside for a moment.” His voice trembled a bit but, as he wasn't a screaming, sobbing wreck, he thought he was handling this pretty well all things considered.

Everyone kind of went silent for a moment. “Alright, yeah. I put your coat on the chair next to the door. Just remember to not wander too far, no telling if there wasn’t anything else crazy in there, y’know?” said a mildly large, college-age woman with blue-dyed hair. 

The thought struck him, “My God, she's young enough to be my granddaughter.” He forced that idea to the back of his mind and instead forced a smile. “Thank you.” he said.

---

Maybe 15 minutes of sitting outside on the porch chair in the cold later, he heard the door open behind him. “Hey, just checking to see you're okay and haven’t frozen to death or something.” said the same blue-haired woman from earlier.

“No, I'm quite alright.”

“So, do you want to talk about what you saw?”

John waved his hand broadly at the frozen tree-line in front of him. “My life.”  A silence passed between them.

“Oh. Cool.”

“Or a possible life. One that I suppose I’ll never have, now.”

“Any sort of disorientation? Any kind of confusion? Do you know where you are?”

“No, no real confusion. I’m pretty sure I’m here.” He took a moment to swallow. ”I guess I realized what had happened when... I remembered I had shared a room in a nursing home with a woman. I knew that I loved her, but I just couldn't remember her name. That couldn’t be right, you know? I think I'd remember her name if I loved her.”

“Well… that’s pretty… yeah.”

John nodded in response. “I do have one question, though.”

“Sure, what's up?”

He looked over to her. “Is my name still John?”

She returned the stare. “Unless... you’d like a different name then yeah, you’re still John. Though, even then, we’d probably still call you John. Or J. Little J.” she said, giving him a light shoulder bump.

He smiled as best he could. “That's good. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to be alone for a little while. I can feel everything slipping away from me right now. I'd like to spend a little time remembering them before they're all gone. If that’s alright.”

“Yeah, cool. That’s, that’s fine. Just letting you know, your keys are on the table by the door if you wanna head back home. But, you can also stay the night on the couch if you don't feel up to driving. Y’know, just putting that out there.”

“Thank you.”

“Okay, just holler if you need anything. I’m gunna go back inside.” 

He heard at the door close behind her. He tried to think of what he wanted to remember, but it was like trying to fight through mud. There weren't any details he could hold on to. Events seem to come in any order. The only thing that stayed with him was the feeling he had lost something, but he didn't know what.  Alone by himself on that porch, he was suddenly struck by the utter stillness of it all.",Rabid_Mouse
"[WP] Cthulhu wakes from his slumber, but he's incredibly underwhelming.",Crown118,"We were all waiting at the beach. The prophecies had long stated His arrival on this place and on this day. We made all the necessary sacrifices and more. I was excited. I would be able to serve our new lord and more importantly I could prove to Sarah that I was not crazy. Maybe she would even take me back. Best not to get my hopes up tough. I should focus on the present. Cthulhu could arrive at any minute.

We were a strange bunch of people waiting on the beach. A few hundred man and women all dressed in black cloaks and masks. Behind us on the dunes there were a few members of the press. They were getting impatient. He was late. Not us though. We had to show our faith.

Then out of nowhere the clouds started turning darker. A thunder rumbled in the distance. The waves grew up to a few meters high. We had to retreat higher up the beach to avoid getting soaked. 

Then it began. The waves started to part. This is always how I imagined Moses would have looked. From the press I could hear some screams of amazement or maybe they were just scared. Not us we stood there unwavering waiting for him to accept us.

A dark shape came up walking from the bottom of the sea. It was at least five meters tall and looked like a crossing between an octopus and a man. I felt a shiver come down my spine. I heard several members of the press scream and run. But not me, not us we kneeled in front of our master. 
Then it spoke with a high pitched voice: “Surely you are not all of my followers!” We looked around unsure what to say. Finally our leader, André, spoke up. “Well my lord. Yes. But now that we have proof of your existence we can recruit so many more.” 

Cthulhu sighed deeply. “Well in that case I might as well go back to bed.” He turned around and started walking back into the sea. “Would you kindly write some prophecies to predict my coming in a millennia or two?” 
The seas closed behind him. We looked at each other in despair. I was doomed. If Sarah would hear I wasted so much of my life on this she would never take me back.

"[WP] In an alternate 2016, the Internet was a passing fad in the 1990s but never really caught on.",DCBW1144,"Professor Robyn Royce fiddled with her O-Phone on the subway into work. She traced a hand over the leather case for the optic discs stored in a little pocket on the back. She pressed the little bootup switch on the side and then inserted the small glass coin labelled 'Dungeons and Dragons Digital X' in bevelled writing. The phone warmed up in her hand slightly as its screen blinked into life displaying its flickering pixelated display. She jabbed a finger at the 'run' text box on the touch screen and the game booted into life. 

The ride into campus was quick enough but the walk to the neglected little computer sciences wing was another matter. Most of the big subjects were in one of the four modern buildings, designed in the soft, powder-and-pastel minimalism that had become stylish in recent years. The Computer Sciences Department meanwhile sat in one of the dilapidated brownstones on the outskirts of the facility sharing space with philosophy and art history and other blow-off subjects. 

""Done all that can be done."" Dean Harlan used to say. ""Really just a vocation now."" The ruddy-faced Englishman used to say whenever she pushed for more funding. Deep down Robyn even thought he was right, from time to time. An optic disc could already hold terabytes and word processors were as good as they ever needed to be. What more was there that had not already been tried? 

When she reached the six by six academic cell that was her office her assistant Henry Daye, a dopey trust-fund kid was already waiting for her. A letter was halfway written on his typewriter and a game disc was almost certainly loaded on his computer. His acid green and white letterman jacket stuck out against the drab brick and hardwood interior, as did his large, over-gelled pompadour.

""Some guy in this rad looking leather jacket dropped off a package for you, Professor."" He said as he reached down behind his desk and produced a little wooden briefcase. It was made from glossy, oiled mahogany bevelled with a patern of ones and zeroes on either side. ""He said you'd know what it was all about.""

""I do, cancel all my classes postpone any meetings and then take the day off,"" Robyn said as she snatched it up off the desk.

She quickly scurried inside and cleared a space on her cluttered desk to put the briefcase down between her typewriter and her desktop computer. When she opened it there was a revolver with five bullets in it. What grabbed Robyn's attention most, however, was a small optic disc taped to the inside of the lid. It was bevelled not with a name, but a symbol. A sunrise over cresting waves. 

She popped out her DnD, letting the small almost invisible disc become lost under the sheets of paper on her desk and then inserted this new one. Her phone's screen flickered more than usual as she pressed the run button and then was replaced with a crisp typewriter font that popped up in time to the words ""Hello World. And you Robyn."" A familiar voice said in a warm, grumbling tone.

Robyn suppressed a gasp as the recording went on. ""So you made Professor. Even got tenure, that's not bad for thirty-one,"" The voice laughed. ""But if you're listening to this then....well hopefully I'm still alive but I'm going to need your help. I was looking through our CERN archives and I found it. They must've thought they destroyed it when they killed Tim Berners-Lee but he hid it somewhere first. I couldn't risk sending it to you but....somewhere out in the world is the firmware for the World Wide Web.""

There was a buzzing over the intercom. ""I gave you the gun because I've probably already put you in mortal danger. Stay safe, little bird. We can still bring the world together."" He almost whispered. And then nothing.

Robyn pressed the intercom and waited for the answer. ""Could you come out here for a moment Professor Royce, I'm having trouble with the uh...filing programme. It won't let me log off."" He said. Even Henry, a really rather inept student could have handled that one.

""Just a second,"" Robyn said as she picked up the revolver and held it behind her back.

"[WP] In an alternate 2016, the Internet was a passing fad in the 1990s but never really caught on.",DCBW1144,"“Dammit Tom!” yelled Mark. “I told you to put away your Playboys like three times! I’m tired of seeing them on the coffee table. And I told you to stop jerking off on my couch!” 

Mark and Tom had been best friends since college, and moved in together after they graduated. Neither had found his ideal career quite yet. 

“Alright, alright. Don’t get your panties in a knot.” replied Tom, lazily making his way downstairs. It was almost noon and he was still in his boxers, hair amess. Tom had recently been let go from his serving job at a small mom and pop restaurant, Chilango’s, due to lack of business. A Chili’s had just moved in next door and taken most of their regular customers. Mark, on the other hand, had just gotten a job as assistant copywriter at a small publishing company. He mostly was responsible for getting coffee and printing copies, but the job promised upward mobility if he worked hard enough. He was trying to get his life in some kind of order. He thought if he wrote one good story, the company may boost him up to salaried. For the past few days, he had been hard at work on his typewriter. 

Tom sat down in the chair across from Mark. “You know you should really think about buying a computer. I hear they’re doing all kinds of cool word processing stuff these days. That stupid thing is so loud and annoying.” 

“Thanks, but I’ve seen what they can do, and they’re not all that special. My typewriter works just fine. Plus, those computer things cost like $3,000 each. I really don’t see the point.”

“Hey, toss me the phone book, will ya?"" Tom asked. “I can’t remember the number of that pizza place we ordered from last time.”

Mark groaned. “Really, man? We just had pizza two days ago. And you ate the leftovers yesterday. Can’t we do something different?” 

The pair usually debated on what to eat for lunch for at least half an hour. Neither cooked and neither were particularly decisive. “Ok fine.” Tom said. “Then you decide. First thing that comes to your head, okay?” Three, two, one…choose!”

 “Pizza!” Mark replied. “Shit! Okay fine we’ll do pizza.”

Mark grabbed the phone book and found the number himself. “You know; I wish there was some kind of phone book that was updated all the time. All these new restaurants popping up everywhere and I have no idea about it. I want to try all of them!”

“Yeah, all these stupid-ass corporations is more like it. I can’t believe Chilango’s is gonna have to shut down now because of god damn Chili’s. I’ll tell you the problem too; they don’t know how to advertise themselves at all! Meanwhile, Chili’s is showing ads on T.V. every 10 minutes. You can’t escape it. Chilango’s needed more media presence. It’s really sad that these small businesses can’t keep afloat simply because they can’t market themselves like big businesses. It’s only a matter of time before this country will be run by corporate giants and we’ll all be out of a job, begging for change on the streets.”

Mark just shook his head in response. “Ah, here it is; Southside Pizza.” he said. He grabbed the phone and wrestled with the tangled-up-cord for a bit before calling in the order. Meanwhile, Tom flipped on the television. Nothing exciting was happening in the news, so he put on MTV. A hip-hop video was on. “Man, I miss what this channel used to be. Used to be good music videos! Now all we see are shit music videos with overblown rappers screaming about ass and cars all the time. I almost wish they’d just show shitty reality shows. It’d be better than this crap.” 

After placing the pizza order, Mark went to the front door to grab the newspaper. “You should look for a job today, Tom.” he said, tossing the newspaper at him. “You never know who’s hiring.” 

“Please,” Tom replied, “There’s only ever crap in the papers. I’m not gonna waste my time looking for lawn-mowing advertisements. I wanna do something huge. I think this layoff was the best thing that ever happened to me, in fact. I feel more inspired to make something of myself than I ever have.”

“Well that’s great, but in the meantime you have to have some income. I can’t afford this place alone.”

The two sat in silence for several minutes before Tom finally said, “Do you remember that thing from like, 20 years ago. We were just toddlers but our parents talked about it a lot I think. Oh man, what was it called? You had to have a computer to use it, I think.”

“You mean the intronet?” Mark replied. 

“Yeah that was it! The intronet.” Do you remember what all the fuss was about with that thing?”

“Not really. My dad said all it was good for was virtual porn and cat videos or something like that. Why do you ask?”

“Well, I dunno. Just seemed like a big deal from what I remember, kind of like Beanie Babies. You remember those?”

“Oh, hell yeah! I had all those things. Even the white bear with the American flag on him! Kinda sucked that everyone said they’d be worth something someday. I think I sold all mine at a garage sale. 90’s fads were dumb dude. That’s probably why the whole intronet thing or whatever it was died out too.”

“Yeah, I guess they were kind of dumb.”

A half hour later the pizza arrived. As the two chowed down, Tom sat down next to Mark on the couch and asked, “So what’s your story about?” Mark wasn’t usually one to share his ideas. “You know; it’s not really done yet. And I don’t want to sound like a dick, but I’d like my space back.”

“Okay, okay.” Tom replied. “Didn’t mean to get all in your face. Book?”

“What?” Mark asked. 

“Is it a book?”

“No, just a short story. And I’m really having trouble getting it going. I’m not even sure if it’s 140 characters yet.”

“Oh, man, that’s a bummer. Well keep working, I’m sure you’ll get it.” Tom then turned on the T.V. again, quickly browsing through the channels. 

“Jesus man, instead of tubing all day, why don’t you look for a job?” Mark asked.
 
“Instead of what?” Tom replied.

“Tubing. It’s a new thing I heard the other day. People aren’t channel surfing anymore; they’re tubing. You tube all day. You need to find work!” 

Tom felt Mark's irritation and decided it best to leave him alone for a while. “Alright fine,” he said, “I’ll just take my magazines and go to my room for a while.”

“Ugh, that’s all your room is good for isn’t it? It’s like your little hub for porn. Might as well start calling it your porn hub.” 

Tom was now angry at his roommate. He could normal handle a lot, but Mark was being extra dicky today. “You know what man; you’re being an asshole. So I’m gonna go to my room, enjoy myself, and then start looking for a job to appease you, *almighty master*. Oh and by the way, your so called ‘story’, I reddit. It sucks!”

“Oh. My. God…” slowly Tommy started to realize what just happened
“OH MY FUCKING GOD!” the realization finally struck him with full force and poor Tom started to freak out. 

Surrounded by the spookiest forest his adorable, symphonic-metal-loving, long-sleeve-jumper-wearing, goth friend Alice could come up with, Tom knew that this was not going to end well. Shivers came down his spine as he looked through the shivering black leaves of the centuries old oaks, not sure if he saw crimson sparkling eyes staring back at him here and there or his irritated imagination was already playing tricks on him. Tom was no survivor, his knowledge of the horrors of the outside world were limited by this one time he saw “Castaway” during his regular Sunday Tom Hanks Movie Marathon. And this was no regular outside, this could be worse than high school, since the sheer amount of orcs and goblins he was about to meet was surely higher than during his senior year back at Mooresville High. 

“That bastard! How could he!” Tom’s fear was transforming into all kinds of other emotions starting with anger. 

“After all I’ve done for him! Never trust a rogue! Never trust a…” Tom stumbled mid-sentence trying to delay the new horrifying realization that was about to hit him on the head like a spiked two-handed mace.

“…Rogue… If I’m here, then this good for nothing, back-stabbing, life stealing Thief is back in my house! With Alice! And Frank and the others!!!!” 

Bitter tears came running down his cheeks as his fear and anger now morphed into all-embracing sorrow. He started to pity himself, thinking of how miserable he was, how he never told Alice how he felt about her, how they were all planning to go to E3 this year since his video blog was finally huge enough for him to be considered press, and how it was all gone now since he was probably going to be torn apart by some silver-tailed hydra, one piece per head. 

Tom was desperate, completely crushed as his imagination was betraying him once again offering graphic depiction of his own creation, Elf Rogue named Martice, chopping his friends to bits. First frank, poor Frank got a critical hit on the eye before he even saw the bastard! Then Gordon. Gordon knew some martial arts, but what could he do against a cold-blooded killer Tom nurtured with his best abilities for one sole purpose – annihilating any threat with one elegant blow? William, silly, chubby William, who always knew the extent of his abilities, tried to hide behind an old mirror, but no place is safe from the one born to lurk in the shadows. The last things Will saw were his own terrified face and a wide smile sparkling from underneath a black leather hood behind him. The last one standing…Alice…

“No! I don’t even want to think what he would do to Alice!” – Tom finally snapped out of it! 

“I’m not giving up! I’m getting out of this place! I’m putting an end to this myself!” the final stage of Tom’s disparity bloomed into a rock-hard resolve. 

Even if he couldn’t save his friends, he would at least avenge them and wipe out this one mistake he had made in D&amp;D. Wipe it with blood. Tom may not had the skills or the equipment for this kind of adventure, but there was one advantage he had over any creature crawling in these woods – knowledge. What he lacked in dexterity he made up in wisdom, where he lacked the strength his intelligence would come to help. No, this was not going to be like High-school. Back there he knew nothing of the creatures attacking him, but here…here he knew every stat, every tiny weakness they bared. This was his world! 

Tom stood up and looked up at the sky knowing, that somewhere above the dome lies his goal. 

“Poor, poor Thomas… You know where your problem lies?” a deep calm voice was coming out of nowhere, but spreading everywhere, and Tom recognized his worst enemy even though he’d never heard him speak before. 

“I’ll be a good guy for once and tell you: you should have stuck to your beloved “Neutral Good”! Choosing the Chaotic Evil alignment was so… outside your character” Tom could feel the smirk on Martice’ face even without seeing him. 

“Oh, and the second mistake you’ve made was calling me “Martice”” the Rogue added, and three blood golems named “Martin”, “Mark” and “Marlo” appeared right before Tom. 

“Now I’m the Dungeon master. Let’s play for a bit!” 

And thus began Tom’s legendary quest, a quest for his life.

However, just for your consideration, if Grokk really didn't have a high charisma stat, why would Joe knowing his charisma stat be touted as an advantage, leading Joe to believe that simply knowing his charisma stat would allow him not to fall for the Orc's trick? 

If Grokk did have a high charisma stat, there wouldn't need to be a natural 20 rolled by an unseen player for him to pass the diplomacy check and it would imply that Grokk is clever enough to use the background knowledge of Joe's character as a negotiation point before they were backstabbed and caught flat footed. 

Another implication is that the metaphysical GM was so entertained by Grokk's antics that he allowed Grokk to pass the diplomacy check without a roll altogether. ",ExJohn

Joe glared.  

""All those years,"" said Joe, waving the shotgun, ""you guys gave me shit for bringing my gun to D&amp;D.""  

The others hadn't quite managed to refocus their eyeballs yet. Mark had sunk almost below the table, the top of his head just barely visible behind his meticulously-organized arsenal of red translucent dice.  

""You said my shotgun *scared* you. You said the Second Amendment didn't *matter.* But now, with a literal *orc* in the basement, I don't hear anybody complaining!""  

""Actually, Joe,"" said Grokk, selecting his words carefully, ""as I recall, the Second Amendment thing was more your talking point than theirs. If you don't mind me saying.""  

""Shut your mouth,"" snapped Joe. ""I've seen your charisma stat. It's not going to work on me.""  

""Guys,"" said Grokk, hoping the others would be more amenable to reason, ""I know this seems wrong, but -- I'm just not meant for that world, okay? All the killing... the dragons... and, heaven forbid, the *dungeons...*""  

""Oh, so you think Jared's a better fit?""  

On the table, a miniaturized version of their friend Jared ran terrified circles around a can of root beer, an equally-miniaturized kobold hot on his heels. 

""eee miii mii eee meee!!"" squeaked Jared.   

Joe bent down to listen, keeping his eyes trained on the armor-plated orc.  

""What was that?""  

""KILL IT KILL IT KILL IT EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE,"" said Jared.  

""You see what I mean?"" said Joe distastefully, pointing at his friend. ""If he can't handle a kobold, how long do you think he's going to last?""  

""I'm sorry,"" said Grokk, as meekly as his tusks would allow.  

""Couldn't you just have wished to *join* our world, instead of stealing somebody else's place in it?""  

""I thought he'd like it there,"" said Grokk. ""He certainly seemed to enjoy the games.""  

""And what did you plan on doing once you arrived? You know how America feels about foreigners with different-colored skin. And that's, like, typically a brownish color, at most. Look at you! Positively viridescent!""  

""You're going to steal our jobs,"" protested Mark from beneath the table.  

""I just want a fair chance,"" said Grokk. ""Isn't that what this country was built on?""  

""Look,"" said Joe, ""we're gonna power-level Jared. The moment he hits level 10, we're wishing things right back to the way they were.""  

""Aw, come on, man,"" said Grokk. ""Don't be like that.""  

Joe glared.  

""Remember how I saved your Elf Ranger? Priscilla? I took a ballista bolt for her, Joseph!""  

The glare continued in all its unibrowed glory.  

""Look! If you let me stay, I'll tell you how to get *her* into the real world too! Wouldn't you like that? A tall, slender elf to keep you company during these frigid north-Florida nights?""  

Joe's eyes widened.  

""That's impossible,"" he said.  

""Well,"" said Grokk, ""I'm here, aren't I?""  

Joe studied the orc's pleading face. He thought about his elf ranger, the drawings of her that he kept in the secret journal under his pillow back home... her long, slim legs... her preposterously-large, almond-shaped eyes...  

He put the shotgun down.  

""Alright,"" he said, extending a hand for Grokk to shake, ""you've got a deal.""  

Grokk ripped Joe's arm off and beat everyone in the room to death with it.

Will was never able to take the world seriously, and often made puns, references, and Bel-Air rhymes in the middle of combat. He even took levels in [Bard](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard) and [Paladin](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/paladin), Which slowed his accent towards level 10.

I was  chillin in my castle, cool and calm,

When a Robot Golem comes along

And my GM's crazy, its CR's too high

But I jump down, cuz I'm hella fly

And It's immune to magic, so I can't do much

So I call my party, disturbing their chill,

So this 'bot won't conquer our hill,

And we run right down and beat down its face

And my buddy George crits with his mace

so the robot's dead, and I look inside

But a bomb thought it was a great place to hide

I fail my check to book it, so I roll again

But I still get knocked to negative ten

It got to the point that when Aaron sat down at the table, he became the [flash](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/blinding-flash-combat) prince of Bel-Air, complete with dated 90's references and an idiotic hat. Despite his habit of doing stupid maneuvers ""for the Lolz"", he managed to survive to Sorcerer level 10.

He wished, "" I wish my earth homie could join me here,
 
so we could tour my castle and clink two beers ""

The GM scribbled something down.

The rest of the table blinked, and then stared at the tall black man who had suddenly replaced Aaron.

""Aaron's cool, but he's level one, 

With no XP, he'll have no fun""

Jeremy replied, ""Aren't you surprised to be here?""

""Aaron never decided on the prophecy,

Now he is trapped and I am free""

"[WP] A D&amp;D player plays his character as if the character knows that he is imaginary, and breaks the fourth wall constantly. At Lv 10, the character gains the wish spell, and uses it to switch with the player. It works.",Deadduch,"&gt; You could read it either way.

This is what really jumps out at me -- it was so *obvious* to me that the implication was one way, and rereading it with the other interpretation in mind it's so *obvious* that it's the other way! And yet, either reading works really well, resulting in an entertaining story without weird friction.

When I read it (as I did initially) as ""Grokk's charisma is low"" the end of the story was an excellent surprise. When read as ""Grokk's charisma is high"" the end of the story is in a sense inevitable, and Joe's fatal assumption (""I'm immune because I know his ability"") is quite literally fatal!

It comes from theatre, as I understand it. On a stage you have the three walls in which the performance takes place and then an invisible/imaginary ""fourth wall"" between the performers and the audience. ""Breaking the fourth wall"" refers to acknowledging the audience, and thus the fact that the play is a performance, as part of the performance.

Her name was May, and she had rose gold hair that hid her forehead. Little pink wrinkles at the edges of her lips, which she pursed, moist, kissing my neck. Her hands were soft, they moved across my chest pulling hairs, a sadistic streak which introduced me to boundaries I didn’t know existed.
 
“Why did you choose me?” she playfully whimpered in mock fear, large blue eyes shaded by winged brows stared into my gray ones. I lit up, flipping her over and forcing the bed covers to run wild along the floor.

I would move against her, and she moved against me. Shocking me with ripples of ecstatic pain and warmth. That was the evolution of our relationship. When I met her in the morning, at a coffee shop in Singapore, the humid air had clung to her skin.
 
Now she was dry as bone.

It was delirium, hours and hours spent making love. We moved to handcuffs, then ropes, then metallic twisty things that our coworkers would joke about only past midnight – only after a few rounds, so to establish the excuse of pervasive inebriation. 

Why didn’t that excuse work now? My eyes still swam in the lights, my ears still rang, orgasms that had happened kept coming back and disrupting my conscious with guilt. 

“More, harder”, she had whispered, and I delivered. Probing like a pediatrician, pursuing her pleasures with every gasp and tremor. Until there was no response.

Lovers, that’s what they called us on the news, the detective told me. Is that supposed to make me feel better? We were going to be so much more.

[WP] Every night you go to sleep you keep having the same dream of kids playing at a familiar park with the same people watching over them. A week later you find that the same 5 kids in your dream have been abducted and killed from that same park but no one knows who it was...,Gyrotate,"I move the sheets away from my body, my feet kick out and touch the floorboards.

“That fucking dream again.” I think to myself.

I walk over to the fridge and swing the door open. I stare deeply at nothing, my wrists and knuckles ache, I try and spread my hands but they feel all bruised and battered. I open the freezer and grab a packet of peas and move over to the couch and flick on the television.

An urgent news report appears.

“Today at Milton Park, 5 children have been abducted and police are looking for anyone who knows any information.” Says the reporter

I shake my head in disbelief. “Surely not?” I think to myself.

One of the child’s mothers appears on the screen, her face is white and full of horror. “Please, if you have seen Billy or any of these boys, bring them home, he wouldn’t hurt a fly.” Says the mother.

I flick the TV off and walk towards the bathroom to splash some water on my face. “I can’t believe this.” Saying in my head.

My head feels faint, my body starts to stray side to side and my stomach feels sick. For some reason the bathroom door catches my eye and is shut.

“I never leave that door shut.” I said to myself.

I approach the door, and firmly squeeze the doorknob. My knuckles crack as I squeeze and twist it open. The door slides open, I move my hand around in the darkness to find the light switch, all I feel is the cold tiles on the wall. My hand hits the switch, the light flickers on. My eyes light up as if a truck is coming towards me, five bloody shirts are soaking in the bathtub.

My girlfriend enters the apartment and pops her head around the wall.

This number has never been seen before in all of history.",Hazbro29,"This was it. This was the end. One more person. I only had to kill one more person.

“This is the end, Director! This is the end of your flawed system! After this, parents won’t have to worry about what silly number you and your ilk assign to their babies! After this, children won’t have to live with the stigma of a low number! Men will be judged for what they do, instead of being prejudged for what they could do!”

I harden my resolve as I prepare to take this man’s life. I would’ve thought I’d be used to it by now; god knows how many people I’ve killed to get here, but it never got any easier.

“You did all this for your son, Mr. Jones? You faced impossible odds and came out the other end virtually unscathed just to protect your son?” the Director queried with an unsettling calmness, as if he wasn’t staring down the barrel of a gun.

My son. My newborn son who was assigned a threat level of one. There was no precedent for the potential destruction a number one could bring. At best, he’d be a pariah. People would view him as a monster. At worst, he’d be executed. They would execute a baby over a number… They would execute *my* baby!

“Of course I’m doing this for him!” I yelled. “I won’t let you bastards ruin his life, or worse, take it away, over some stupid number that might not even mean anything!”

I felt myself growing angrier.

“My son *is not* dangerous. My son *will not* become a monster. My wife and I will make sure of it. We’ll play with him all the time… We’ll teach him good manners, and what’s right and what’s wrong… We’ll love him! And our love will be enough to make sure he never wants to bring harm to anyone!”

I could feel tears stream down my face. Whether from anger, or sadness, or from the weight of what I’ve done, I don’t know, so I ignored them.

“I believe you, Mr. Jones. Your son was never a threat,” the director stated, analyzing me. “No, I believe I know why he was rated so low now.”

“What…?” I whispered. “So, this was all a mistake?”

“No, Mr. Jones. There was no mistake,” he answered.

Confused, I could feel my resolve waning, but I did my best not to let it show.

“So, why is he number one then?” I growled.

The Director smirked. “I don’t know if you realize what you’ve done Mr. Jones. There is anarchy outside these walls. As my organization falls, so too will the society supported upon its back.”

Of course I knew there would be consequences, but I had no choice.

I was so lost in thought that I didn’t notice him walk up to me. He placed his hand on mine, and put his thumb on my trigger finger.

 “No, Mr. Jones,” he grinned, “find solace in the fact that your son would never hurt anyone. No. Your son is number one not because of what *he* will do… Your son is number one because of what his existence has made *you* do.”

And with that, before I could even fully process his words, he pulled the trigger.

A single character displayed on the screen. I wanted to feel the sheer panic and desperation of the doctors and nurses. I wanted everyone in the room to look back at this moment, and realize that this was the beginning of the end for all of them. I wanted to savour this.

A few more moments, and the good doctor would have sounded the alarm, causing armed guards to flood into the room to “neutralize” the situation.

But instead, I pushed the hidden button on my wristwatch. The number on the screen immediately started increasing exponentially. They all let out a sign of relief. The fools.

The number settled at a healthy 2,687,546,2157. The doctor congratulated me on such a high number.

I wanted to burst out into uncontrollable laughter.

But instead, my smile and teary eyes were those of a proud new parent. I was, after all, just a normal father, threat level 1,039,474,023, with a healthy newborn son, threat level 2,687,546,2157.

His receding hairline revealed a bald patch, which reflected the harsh white lights of the maternity unit.  Beeping machines and crying children sang together in a sickening dissonance, destroying any hope of joy this new father yearned to attain.  A thin woman lay in a bed beside him, her skin a cold pale white that rivalled the clinical surfaces of the room in which they mourned.

The other families in the unit ignored the couple, far too focused on their own happiness to notice the grief painted on their faces.  A number was recited by a doctor to each of the new parents, a procedure that traditionally accompanied a birth.  Most were far too large to be remembered, numbering in the billions, yet a single digit was all to be told to the small worried man in the corner of the room.

Every stage of grief appeared to play out among the couple in an instant, any words they said being held in their throats by the well of tears they tried so desperately to hide.  The doctor that had dared to say their son was the most dangerous being on earth suffered the wrath of the father, earning a large lump and broken arm for his cheek.  Eventually the man calmed down, and acceptance had began to shed its light on the pair.  The military had already taken their baby; they were helpless, as if they were newborns themselves. 

The two became infamous in the weeks following the historic birth, and rarely did their faces not sit below the shocking headlines of tabloids and magazines.  Paparazzi followed their every step, trying to find whatever nugget of scandal they could in the couple's life.

The pain she thought she would experience was nothing compared to what she was going through right now. Granted, she had no one that could prepare her for this. The only relative she still had was her overseas brother working in the mines and she hadn’t seen the yet-to-be-born child’s father since he gifted her that same child 8,5 months ago. The closest person she had on her side was the taxi driver who brought her in. Upon arrival at the hospital, however, the taxi driver was stopped by several older looking guards, armed with semi-automatic pistols and overused helmets, at the scaled-off hospital entrance. ‘Only known relatives allowed inside’. The supplies in the hospital had become too valuable these days and the government did not take any chances with strangers in government institutions. She clamped the pale rails as she was rushed through the sickly looking corridors of the hospital. 

“Please give me something against the pain.” she moaned.

The nurses did not acknowledge her but instead frantically hurled medical terms back and forth before taking out a spindly syringe to temporarily put her out of misery. Even though sedatives were very valuable, hospitals were known to quickly apply them to make things slightly more bearable for their patients. With the amount of deficiencies that most patients suffered from nowadays this was usually the easiest option. Amy woke up all alone what must have been several hours later as it was now dark outside. She did not feel the same pain anymore and quickly realized they must have already delivered her baby after seeing the incision wound on her stomach. It was a few seconds later that she also noticed she was completely abandoned. Her room was completely empty save for the stand with a clipboard next to the door. There was no noise coming from the hall. She could actually hear one of the new city speakers proclaiming the news in the distance. Usually hospitals were filled to the brim with patients in agony and nurses running around to cater to everyone. To her left was a cup of what she assumed was actual sterilized water. As she tried to reach it she finally heard a sign of life in the hallway. Footsteps, at least several people seemingly came closer. What seemed like minutes later, a young nurse in slightly bloodied, worn apparel appeared and came in to her room. 

“Is it a boy or a girl?” she asked, trying to sit up right at the same time.

The nurse glazed right past her as she ignored her question, instead immediately staring down at the medical clipboard.

“Ma’am? How is my baby?” Amy’s voice started to tremble a bit. The speakers outside could be heard muttering indistinguishably for a moment until the nurse softly squealed, “I’m sorry”, before retreating through the door, taking the clipboard with her. Immediately after an older man in a pristine white coat with bright yellow latex gloves assertively stepped through the swinging door with the same clipboard as before in his hand.

“Doctor, what’s going on?” she said trying to maintain control over her voice. “Please, I just want to-“ 

“He is fine for now.”, he interrupted her with a cold sharp voice. Before Amy could even reacted he continued, “I’m here to inform you that after repeated testing the CITI analysis turned out to be unmistakably positive”. Amy knew what was coming and started whimpering. The doctor raised his voice, “As per section C341 of the Witterman constitution amendment, your child did not meet safe citizen life predictions and has been designated for immediate termination. According to section 484 you’ll have the right to thirty minutes of private time with the infant before termination. Furthermore, according to section C382 you have been sterilized to prevent future instances of unknown paternity. The nurse will bring your son in directly after my departure at which point your thirty minutes will initiate. After the allocated time the guards will reclaim the infant as government property. I’ll remind you not to forget to fill out the required forms on your right, including the infant’s official name for the death certif-“

“No!” Amy shrieked. “This is impossible! You made a mistake! Please review my file and CITI score and you’ll see my son can’t possibly be a thre-“. The doctor overshadowed her with a thundering voice, “Including the infant’s official name for the death certificate and burial mount. You’re scheduled for immediate interrogation after allotted recovery time to inform us about any details you have on the infant's father.” The doctor stared at her for a second or two in silence as Amy’s sobbing faded. The doctor continued in a calmer fashion, “I have reviewed your CITI. There’s nothing we can do. The government feels for your loss. However, due to unknown paternity, you will not have any right to financial compensation, as per section C521."". He left leaving only his footsteps to echo in the dimly lit corridor he came from. Two guards entered the door to Amy’s room as the nurse brought in the infant. The first few minutes Amy did nothing but rock her son in her arms only briefly stopping to wipe the tears of her son’s grey garment. The only thing she could get out of her throat was the name she had planned to call her child.

“James…”

She became more still as she did her best to memorize every little detail about her son. The thin blonde patch of hair on the top of his head. The small distinctly shaped birthmark on his stomach. His dark brown eyes that were darting around his mother’s face, as if he too tried to memorize as many details he could about his mother. As if he knew what she knew. She could only assume that all the mothers before her were in this exact same place as her. She heard the stories, but had never had someone close to her go through this procedure. In fact, only recently the government speakers were informing citizens only 1400 babies unfortunately had to be terminated last year. If it wasn’t for that wretched wonderful night with the father of her child, she realized she too would not have been part of the statistic for next year. In what seemed like only seconds instead of thirty minutes, one of the guards cleared his throat as he decisively approached Amy, as if coming straight from Rimnox’s one of many production factories. You couldn’t even tell if they were or were not androids anyway. All the guards wore thick dark helmets that covered most of their face and were heavily trained to maintain perfect posture at all times. The guard slightly raised his chin as he spoke,

“Time’s u-“

In a snapshot moment, Amy ducked and covered James with her hands. Out of nowhere the guard was being strangled from behind fighting for his life. The guard struggled for breath and in a desperate attempt almost kicked over Amy’s rusty bed. The other guard threw him against the floor with a heavy moan. After that, Amy could only see legs kicking and twitching, and fading moans of desperation as she sat paralyzed in her bed, with James secure in her grasp. Suddenly seconds seemed to last minutes as the struggle quieted down. The second guard stood up, panting heavily but trying his best to stay as quiet as possible. 

“Give James to me.” He directed Amy.

Amy being paralyzed with fear shakenly pulled her body away to protect her infant boy.

“Give him to me, pumpkin, we don’t have much time.”

Amy froze. Suddenly she knew what he was saying, and who was saying it. Her instinct was confirmed as the unknown guard took off his helmet in a rush. 

“Quickly, Amy, I can keep him safe from them.”

As she was slowly regaining control over herself, he continued,

“Give him now, or we’ll all die. The clock has struck and within a few minutes they will come here to check on the guards. Give me James and I will take him with me.” 

“Why didn’t you tell me, Matthew?” She trembled. “You knew all this time.” Her voice became more stern. “You knew this day was coming.”

“I’m sorry, pumpkin. I’m so-“

“Where were you?!” She screamed now. “You could have protected us both!”

“Amy, he’s one! He is a one! I knew there was a good chance he would be a Class zero, I couldn’t risk letting you know before, but even I had no clue he would be a one! Do you have any idea what this means for us?! He is the end!”.

As she heard this she instantly stopped screaming, looking at him in disbelief.

“ I promise you James will have a long life, a good life.”, Matthew continued. “But you have to give him, now.”

Amy looked down in to those dark brown eyes before kissing James on his rosy forehead.  She sniveled as she loosened her grasp. She knew this was her goodbye. Matthew immediately grabbed James, and gently put him in a pouch in front of body armor. As he leaned over he kissed Amy for a second before anxiously bolting out the door. 

It must have been less than a minute later when four guards rushed in along with the doctor from before and an unknown government official, though clearly identifiable as such in the dark green trench coat with red borders and that flag glued to his left chest. One look at the floor told them all they needed to know. 

“Do you know what you have done?” the doctor screamed, “DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE DONE?!”. 

The government official raised his arm and shot the doctor point blank through the head. Before the doctor’s body even hit the ground he marched to Amy. 

“Go on then, kill me too!” Amy said in a loud but severely trembling voice. “It’s all you scumbags know to do.”

The man stared at her for a minute before speaking in a chilling voice, “Not yet.”

---------------------

It was 9.30 in the morning when Karen's contractions began. I had begun to panic as usual, but in her usual manner, she kept calm whilst I fussed around with her hospital bag making sure we had everything.
 I had my sleeves rolled up and I remember glancing at the number on my left wrist. 6,492,111,667. The same birthmark everybody had, an indicator of a persons threat to humanity. Mine was an unusually large number, making me as dangerous as a wet-blanket.

*You never know* Karen had joked, *if you hold a wet blanket over somebodies face they might drown*. She had said it with a smile. Her threat was under a billion, at 996,104,359, which isn't uncommon in very driven people, such as CEOs of large companies. Karen ran a mid-sized bakery, known for ruthless tactics in both business and baking. It's one of the things I love about her.

Anyway, back to the day in question, we hopped in the car. We had a Ford Mondeo back then, so it wasn't exactly fast, but we made it to the hospital. I remember waiting around for about 3 hours before Karen got a bed. And then things started.

There was some kind of trouble. Something went wrong and.... Karen lost a lot of blood. They told me they had to rush her into surgery and so I wasn't even in the room when she was born.

Jade. 

I was standing outside the operating theater; they told me to be nearby so I could see my daughter when she came. I heard the collective gasp. I knew I shouldn't go inside, but I was panicking enough as it was and so was about to burst in when the nurse came out. Wheeling my daughter, in a little trolly. 

She told me they still had more to do for Karen, but wanted to let me meet my daughter. She was a healthy 9 pounds. 

""Do you want to hold her?"" I remember the nurses words clear as day. I picked her up and cooed softly. She was so tiny. She didn't cry, just smacked her lips and went to sleep in my arms. Even though I was worried about Karen I couldn't help but smile. She was perfect.

Then I remembered the gasp. ""What did you all gasp about?"" I asked the nurse. A worried look had crossed her face and she pointed to her left wrist. I remember her number clearly too, 3,823,495,644. A reasonable number for a healthcare worker. She replied ""See for yourself"".

I unwrapped Jade gently, although we hadn't given her a name at that point. Her wrists were so small. On her left wrist, just under the heel of her thumb, was the number.

1.

Looking down at her I knew. I knew in that moment she was going to have trouble throughout her whole life because of that number. People would try and hurt her, people may even try and kill her, all because of that number.

And even if she ended up killing every person alive, it didn't matter to me.

Because she was my daughter.

And I would do *anything* to protect her.

I took hold of her little hand. She was still fast asleep at this point, and I kissed her on her head. She had quite a thick head of hair, and I remember how soft it was. As I kissed her I whispered to her ""I promise, daddy will always be here for you"".

And then I looked at my daughter again, and back to her hand. Where the number sat just under her wrist.

2.

""what?!?"" I had actually exclaimed that out loud. She woke up a bit and grisled into my chest before falling asleep again. The nurse asked me what was the matter, and so I showed her. She couldn't believe it either. Her number had changed. Both of us had seen the number 1 had turned into a 2. And neither of us had *ever* heard of anybodies threat level changing.

So we did the obvious things, we looked at our own wrists. 

Hers was 3,823,495,644. Still a reasonable number for a healthcare worker.

Mine was 1.",daekle

In 3084, the population crisis had convinced the UN to enact a worldwide 1 pregnancy policy. You got one chance at bringing a child into the world, and then you were sterilized. 

The population dropped off sharply. At first all was well...then we had the riots. Thousands of young couples unable to have children and no children available for adoption had driven them to arms. 

After the riots were squashed, the policy was revised, allowing 1 child born to every family unit. To prevent future riots, every person was scanned at birth and given a number indicating our threat to humanity. 

My family thrived in this new world. We were intelligent, strong, fertile, and never produced a single member higher than 1B. This made us highly sought after as wives and husbands. 

We became wealthy. We gamed the system by taking more than one spouse over a lifetime, ensuring we grew our stock and thus our wealth. We built a vast empire on the basis of selling our genetics to the highest bidder, and life was good. 

I was born with a level of 1,039,474,023. I was well within the safe zone, and my lineage was considered impeccable. I was strong, rarely ever getting sick. The rigorous testing everyone in my family line was put through by our Elders at the Breeding Age confirmed that I would be capable of carrying and birthing a healthy child. My IQ was tested and stayed steady at 120, high enough to entertain a spouse and make them look good without showing them up. I was advertised as Prime Breed Stock, an honor in my family. My half sisters, with whom I was very close, had similar results

I was married off to a very wealthy man with a threat level of 3M. He was on the high side and looking to produce an heir who would be in the low numbers, able to take public office with him as the backseat driver. 

My sister were married off to men with similar aims and aspirations, all seeking an heir to their companies or political pawns. 

We of course obliged, and were pregnant less than 3 weeks into our marriages. 

When my son was born, his threat level was 1. 

I had broken the chain of good children. My sisters gave birth to children with levels 2, 3 and 4, respectively. 

We laughed uproariously at the shock on our husbands faces, the fear shown by others. 

Such stupid jackasses. Did they really think the chain would continue forever? 

Did they really think there wouldn't come a time when we would tire of our role as cattle?

The contractions came, quicker and quicker...  Finally, the midwife held aloft a child, wailing shrilly into the cool evening night.  A boy!

Then, a gasp - there, unmistakeably on his wrist, the number ‘1’.  As I looked closer at my newborn son, I saw that he was misshapen, one half of his face blackened with swollen pustules.

The midwife stumbled forwards, dropping him, and I shrieked out in horror, rushing forwards.

“No!  What are you doing!!  He’s my son...!”

As I stepped forwards, I too faltered and staggered, watching as the midwife slumped to the ground with my son in her arms, her eyes quickly glazing over.  

As my own vision blurred, I dimly caught the sight of the pustules popping on my son’s face, his own wailing shriek suddenly cut short just as my own took flight.  My legs gave way, and I too slumped to the ground, joining the small heap of bodies on the floor.

""Yes you should have, April."" came a voice from the distance. The turtle baby stopped inching towards April to turn around. ""Who said that?"" the turtle baby croaked.

""How dare such a despicable creature like yourself tarnish the awesome power of 'Cowabunga'. "" Came a voice and along with it a Sai flying through the air. The turtle baby caught it with one hand and chuckled. ""So it's you Raphael. Not surprised that you're angry about this whole situation. After all, Michelangelo was-"" before the baby could finish its sentence, a swift kick flying from out of the darkness silenced him. 

""Don't you dare you piece of shit!"" Raphael cried as he repositioned himself to jump on top of the baby. As Raphael was in the air, the baby spun on the floor around facing his shell to Raphael. Just as Raphael's feet were about to touch the floor, the baby sprang up backwards, slamming his hard shell into Raphael's face. Raphael fell back onto the floor, blood streaming out of his nose.

""Ah Raphael, now that I am finally out of the womb, I can take revenge for what April did to master Shredder"", the turtle baby menacingly said. 

""What in the hell are you talking about? April never went near Shredder"" Raphael said, choking on his own blood. 

""Oh come on Raphael. There is a reason, it didn't just happen, it's not a mystery. April had sex with Michelangelo now Shredder is dead. And he had a horrible death because she had incredible sex. It's just the way life works."" explained the turtle baby. 

""No.. it can't be..."" murmured Raphael.

""Master Shredder's hatred power was instilled into Michelangelo's sperm during the copulation. And you are now looking at the embodiment of that power. Prepare to die, Raphael!"" the turtle baby said as he began to charge at Raphael. 

""EXCELLENT!"" came a new voice, this time a pizza followed, slapping the turtle baby in the face and burning his face with the cheesey goodness that wrapped around his face and eyes. 

""MIKEY!!"", Raphael joyously screamed. 

""Sorry I'm late, babe."" Michelangelo said to April

Splinter came trailing in after Michelangelo. ""Michelangelo! There is no time, only April can save us and she needs the blood of the father to restore her strength!"" 

The three looked at her vitals monitor, she clearly needed blood immediately. Michelangelo rushed to the cabinet to bring out all the necessary supplies for the transfusion.

""Leave this one to me boys!"" Raphael said as he leapt on top of the turtle baby and began pummelling it in the face. Each punch flung bits of hot cheese off its face and into the air. ""Looks like you could handle the Pizza you got from Mommy while you were in the womb, but not the real deal!"" He held his right arm up to prepare for a Haymaker. ""CAN'T TAKE THE HEAT, GET OUT OF THE KITCHEN!"" he screamed as his punch sunk into the turtle baby's face, knocking it unconscious.

By now the transfusion was underway and the color in April's face slowly returned. ""April we need your powers to combat the baby immediately"" Splinter explained. April looked around the room ""Oh Mikey... you and Raph came for me... what happened to Brian??"" she asked ""Oh yea he dead."" said Raphael. 

""April do you have the strength to use your powers??"" Michelangelo asked, very weakly. ""Almost but not quite, I'll need much more."" She said. ""That's what I thought, baby. Please forgive me"" He whispered. ""What...?"" said April, quietly.

Just then a noise could be heard outside, something like an electric generator whirring up a massive amount of energy. BAM! A massive hole was blown in the ceiling and down came a figure in a bronze, futuristic armor suit flying down into the room.

""SAMUS??? WHAT IS THIS WHORE DOING HERE MIKEY?"" screamed April. ""Oh baby it was only one time. We need her now..."" he said, weaker still. 

Samus pressed a few buttons on her blaster arm and signaled towards April. Then, a massive metroid, almost half the size of 6 foot 4 Raphael came floating in the room through the hole Samus created. 

""Jesus christ what the FUCK?"" April screamed as the Metroid clasped itself upon her head. ""Oh my god oh my god"" she murmed while bits of light went through the green transparent metroid down to its claws that were wrapped around April's head. 

""Oh my god I'm feeling so much stronger now"" April said in a trance-like state after a while. She said as she sat up in her bed. The metroid released itself from her head and floated back out from where it came. Samus nodded at April and gave a salute to Michelangelo then space jumped out of the facility. 

""APRIL NOT MUCH TIME LEFT!!"" Raphael shouted as the turtle baby was gaining consciousness. The baby rustled a bit and then suddenly opened its eyes and with lightning speed punched Raphael in the face, knocking him back onto his back. The baby leapt upon Raphael and said ""I'mma kill you then I'MMA KILL THIS BITCH TOO!"", it was about to sink its teeth into Raphael's neck when

""WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU JUST FUCKING SAY ABOUT ME, YOU LITTLE BITCH?"", a deep booming voice came from April:  ""I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in-"" she said with her eyes rolled back in her head. 

The turtle baby stopped in its tracks and was wincing. Raphael took the chance to headbutt it in the face, knocking it backwards to the floor, but the turtle baby quickly did a kip up to its feet. And kicked Raphael in the chest with such force that he simply crumpled to the floor and stopped moving. 

""April, the shitpost isn't strong enough! We need more power!"" Splinter shouted. 

""SUCH SHIBA INU DOG, MANY MISUSE OF GRAMMAR. WOW. ERMAHGERD, I TOOK AN ARROW TO THE KNEE, DO A BARREL ROLL"", memes flowed out of April's mouth rapidly. 

The turtle baby flinched. It was visibly damaged. It was attempting to walk towards April.

""YES, It is working April! Don't let up!"" 

""YO DAWG I HEARD YOU LIKE CARS SO I PUT A CAR IN YOUR CAR SO YOU CAN CAR WHILE YOU CAR. HELLO YES THIS IS DOG. COOL STORY BRO, THIS IS THE RAREST OF ALL PEPES-"" as the stream of memes continued, April's voice became deeper and more booming. By now she was more powerful than James Earl Jones.

The turtle baby continued to walk towards April but blood began to seep out of its eyes and nose. 

""Of course! How could I have forgotten!"" Splinter said as he reached for a boom box under April's bed. He connected his MP3 player to the auxiliary port and put on Guile's Theme. 

An American flag started to appear on April's forehead like a fresh burn as she continued: ""U MAD BRO? FUCK HER RIGHT IN THE PUSSY. ONE DOES NOT SIMPLY FUCK A TURTLE. I HOPE SENPAI WILL NOTICE ME-"" 

The turtle baby was now inches from April but blood was now streaming from its ears and mouth. 

""April, we need older memes!"" Splinter yelled with all his might to be heard over April's powerful voice. 

""ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US."" she said with one powerful shout. 

The turtle baby was knocked back and he was now clutching his chest. 

""April, we almost have him! More obscure!"" Splinter said, losing his voice. 

There was a pause which felt like centuries. ""No..."" Michelangelo whispered. ""She's run out of power..."" he said as he began to sob. 

The turtle baby was now on its feet, chuckling. ""You put up a good fight, Mommy, but no one can rival the-"" 

""We just finished level three."" April said, practically whispering.

""No... NO!"" shouted the Turtle baby.  With the little strength he had left, he rushed towards her to silence her. 

""And need to..."" said April, slightly louder this time. 

""NOOOOOOO!"" the turtle baby was shouting as he was about to punch her in the stomach. 

""TIGHTEN UP THE GRAPHICS A LITTLE BIT!!!"" bursted out of Aprils mouth. 

The turtle baby was blasted back into the far wall. It slid lifelessly down to the floor and began to writhe on the floor. Cracks appeared in its chest and bright light seeped through the cracks. The baby exploded like a small super nova, killing everyone in the room and saving planet earth.",batslicecameltruck
"[WP] At birth every one gets a number assigned to them which determines their threat to humanity. You are number 1,039,474,023. Your newlyborn son is born. His number is 1. This number has never been seen before in all of history.",Hazbro29,"It was quiet and the world was still.

A wind blew. It chased dust in swirling circles across the wasteland. The oily, thick clouds which hung overhead, leaden and unnaturally still blotted out the sun.

It was sometime in the afternoon, but the world was dark.

Everyone was dead. Every*thing* was dead.

It began, as most stories could, with a birth. Her baby was beautiful, 18.4 inches, 7 pounds 9 ounces, she had a shock of red hair, very rare these days. 

The world had grown full. The population numbered over 10 billion. Resources were strained and in an effort control population, families were limited to one child. Only those who acted in particular distinction were given approval for two. Or they were insanely rich, corruption never ceases.

This was her first child, her only child. She wasn't anyone special, or wealthy, so she knew she'd never get approval for a Second. In fact the most remarkable thing about her was her Number, just over 1 billion.

She was *barely* outside the Watched range. Rumors and conspiracy nuts suggested the governments watched anyone in the top 20 percent but most of these people's numbers were so high, no one feared they had any really damaging evidence to show.

The Number was... complicated. With the growing terror threats of the early to mid 21st century, the government began investing heavily in ways to detect and prevent attacks. Dr. Ivo Andric wrote a formula to calculate a person's threat to humanity. It was a monstrous, complicated thing, involving all kinds of details about a person's life, their habits, their friends, and more. Everything, distilled down into one number calculating the probability of them causing a ""Significant Terror Incident.""

The system wasn't perfect. People were supposed to have their numbers updated once a year. New friends, new experiences, things which may change their philosophies and goals would be taken into account.

A person's first number was assigned at birth. Since babies couldn't do any real harm, they tended to represent the 9 billions, the lowest threats. As a person matures, their numbers would drop as their status and experiences grew. By the time they were about 35, most people's numbers stabilized. They'd met most of their lifelong friends, they were on a career path with predictable results, and they'd moved into a ""settling down"" period. Then as they became gray and worn their numbers would slowly grow back into being meaninglessly huge and unimportant.

But her baby was different. With her red hair and crystal blue eyes, perfectly formed fingers and all ten toes, she was unique. She was her baby, her miracle baby she thought she'd never have.

And she was a 1.

They took her. They took her only baby. She cried, she screamed, she raged, it must be a mistake...

And she finally grew quiet, she grew cold, she withdrew into herself and her depression and missed the Census one year, then another. There was a warrant out for her arrest until she complied and updated her Number. She didn't care. Her beautiful baby girl was gone. Nothing else mattered.

As she fell lower and lower down society's rungs, she fell into drug abuse, took up company with radicals and undesireables, malcontents and cast-offs in a system which did nothing to help those low Numbers but instead persecuted them, hunted them, dogged their every move to make sure they never stepped out of line.

Sometime between the bottom of the bottle and oblivion, she felt a spark start within her again. Her eyes shone, pupils dilated, her face slicked with sweat and tears and her spark grew into a flame. The flame tempered her anger. Her anger became steel, harder than steel. She honed it to a fine point, she crafted it into a sword.

Then she took up that sword against the government, the world which took away her child. She brandished her sword to the grumblers and druggers, the Low Numbers on the run, the philanthropists and philosophers and political activists who took issue with the system.

She became a figurehead, an idol, more than a woman. She became an idea incarnate, she became powerful. She moved the hearts of millions, billions, and growing everyday. She became the leader of her own movement, which spawned a thousand more in a hundred countries.

She became a wave and swept over the world in her fervor.

She crashed like a tsunami as protests broke into riots, riots became civil unrest, unrest became open attacks, and soon the world was plunged into war.

And when she finally got hold of that nuke, she brought her sword down swift and true against the government which had used her, hurt her, taken everything from her.

As she watched the explosion flash in the distance, her red hair dancing in the heat and wind, she carried on her daughter's legacy as Number 1.",TheDon_Perignon

Steve's face drops. His arm turns rigid against my shoulder. I feel weak; my legs tingle. ""Just... 1?""

Before the nurse can answer, Steve is on his feet. ""Let me hold my baby,"" he says. Coldly, calmly.

""I'm -- I'm not supposed to hand him over...""

""I just want to hold him for a moment,"" he says. Is he blinking tears out of his eyes? The nurse quivers, but she hands Alex to him. Wow. I've never seen him so moved, so adamant about our family. Tears well up in my eyes, and I --

Crack.

He swings Alex into the wall.

He falls to the floor.

Dead.

Screaming, I launch myself from the bed. Wobbling, sputtering, I grab his shoulders. ""What have you done?!"" I shriek, beating into his shoulders. ""What -- have -- you -- done?!""

""You know it had to be done! We've never seen anyone with a number below fifty million! He was a demon, hellspawn, and --""

Glinting light catches my gaze, just over Steve's shoulder. The doctor's tools, polished and gleaming, are still laid out on the table.

I reach and grab the biggest knife.

""Mary -- what --""

""He could have had a chance!"" I scream, plunging it at his chest. ""You -- murdered -- our -- son!""

This number has never been seen before in all of history.",Hazbro29,"Isn’t it strange to ponder how the life of some of the most vilified and despicable people in history can be traced back to a single moment of joy as they are held for the first time and gazed upon lovingly. Stalin’s mother unaware she was holding within her arms a tiny bundle that would develop into a devastating, destructive force of nature. Within that brief moment of time optimism is rife; the natural dreams and aspirations of all parents when they see in their child unlimited potential. I myself am thinking back to that moment crystallised in time, my precious little boy, skin soft as a feather squawking and crying as he moved from the comfortable dark into the harsh world that would become his home. That moment now clouded by bitter, bitter memories.

He was a beautiful boy and soon drew the attention of my friends and neighbours within our affluent suburb he was a confident little thing and soon stole everyone’s heart. Always been picked, cuddled and treated by those close to us.

At 9 months I took my boy in for his inoculations and the mandatory TTH (Threat To Humanity) scan. Enacted by the Global Peacekeeping Force (GPF) in response to centuries of warfare this was the first step in a re-education and observation program for those deemed a future threat to society. The majority of people carried on with life unhindered however your TTH impact could have a substantial impact. Individuals with TTH rankings in top 100,000 were automatically disbarred from holding any political office or position in high society however they were substantially funded by the state so they could live a life of luxury and ease, this lifestyle neutered any evil passions by filling their life with distraction and creating humans with very little motivation to even work a job never mind enacting villainous plots. This policy and a number of other measures including widespread surveillance, a large disarmament drive and a completely autocratic global government meant there had not been a large outbreak of violence as long as most of us alive remember. 

A loud incessant beeping broke out in the medical bay, I glanced anxiously at my little bundle of joy as he sat in the scanning chamber, all seemed fine however the doctor stared anxiously at his screen tapping furiously. 

“What’s up doc” I enquired casually,

“I’ve just never seen this… it doesn’t make sense” a tone of rising panic in his voice

As he completed the sentence the door behind me burst open and a squad of jack-booted men stormed into the room,

“Ma’am we are going to have to confiscate your child he has been deemed a threat to humanity and we must remove him” the sergeant of the squad commanded gruffly as he span the doctor’s screen to face him. 

On the screen in iridescent red I noticed the words;
----TTH Level 1 ---- 

The screen pulsed in my brain, could this be happening, is this a horrible dream. I remember unleashing an unearthly scream and hurling myself at the sergeant. He batted me off like a small fly, grabbed my child and marched out leaving me in a heap. 

The fear of my beautiful little boy was so great that the Sergeant took my child outside and immediately performed a summary execution. Breaking my little boy’s body with careless abandon. In a brief moment the life I had nurtured for the past 9 months was extinguished. 

The next moment is etched indelibly into mine and the world’s memory. 
I crawled out of the medical centre, my face a mask of pain and cradled the fragile little body of my little boy who they told me was evil. In that moment a passerby snapped a picture. This turned my private heartbreak into a global controversy. This one act exposed everything negative about the “peaceful” global dictatorship. People were no long willing to suffer indignity, intrusion and impotency in return for global peace. They had sacrificed too much in the name of safety. 

This was the lighted match dropped onto dry tinder.

Pockets of rebellion began small but soon they began to spread like wildfire and a global civil war has now engulfed the earth. I’m now cowering fearfully in a refugee camp trying to remain anonymous as both sides wish to use me a pawn in their propaganda. I’m not built for this I’m just a heartbroken mother of a beautiful little boy.

He wasn’t dangerous but with their actions they have created their own worst enemy. You see a person can be discredited and defeated. In killing a defenceless child they had created a powerful symbol that reverberated internationally. They had created the very monster they sought to destroy…

This number has never been seen before in all of history.",Hazbro29,"Throughout the day, the pain in Susan's stomach was getting worse and worse. By 5PM she was reduced to the fetal position. ""Honey, we need to get to the ER immediately!"" ""No! Brian, I'm fine!"" she replied to Brian with sweat pouring down her face. ""I'm going to have this baby and it's going to be a beautiful healthy child that we will love together"" she stammered. 

""Susan, I'm sorry, we need the doctor to look at you immediately."" Brian said softly as he picked her up in his arms. Susan wrapped her arms around his neck and wept softly. ""The baby is going to be OK, right honey?"" she said to him with tears in eyes, as if she were begging him. ""Darling, I'm sure it will all be fine."" 

The drive to the hospital was quick, Brian was still thanking god for the streak of green lights as he carried Susan into the waiting room. It felt like hours but finally they found themselves on a bed with a doctor in the room. Doctor Thompson calmingly said ""Susan, please relax and let's get a quick Ultrasound. It shouldn't hurt at all.""

Susan was still sweating, anxiously looking at the Ultrasound screen. Dr. Thompson's shocked face made Susan and Brian even more anxious. ""Brian, what has Susan been eating recently?"" he asked, almost as if he was accusing Brian of something terrible. ""Just regular stuff! She takes her pregnancy supplements all the time, she eats plenty of vegetables and is getting a lot of good fats!"" Brian said, defensively. ""Is that it? Nothing extra?"" asked Thompson. ""Well I have been eating a lot of Pizza on the side, Doctor."" Susan chimed in. 

Dr. Thompson was clearly distraught. He barely even responded to the couple, it was more like muttering to himself: ""Pizza... Diet seems normal. What the christ could be causing this. The fuck is up with the shape of this baby?"" Dr. Thompson took some deep breaths to compose himself and drank  bit of water. He looked at the couple and said ""Well. The baby seems alive and well, but... the rate of growth is unprecedented. I'm not sure what is causing this, but it would definitely explain the pain Susan is experiencing."" Brian and Susan sat there in silence, not sure what to say. 

Dr. Thompson muttered to himself again: "" I could almost swear this baby has gotten bigger since the start of the ultrasound..."" 

THE NEXT DAY 6:30AM

""NURSE! SOMEONE GET IN HERE!"" Brian yelled down the hallway. Three nurses sprinted into the room to find Susan writhing in pain and screaming. Her belly was significantly bigger than the day before. ""My god! She should have given birth by now with a stomach that size!"" said one of the nurses. ""Brian, help us hold her down! I'm going to give her a sedative"" said another nurse, attempting to stay calm. 

""IT'S COMING!!"" screamed Susan. She spread her legs apart as the baby practically birthed itself with force. 

The whole scene was terrible to look at. Blood everywhere, Susan was clearly damaged heavily. Brian wept as he held her hand. ""The baby... it's not right... it's not right..."" was all he could say as he stared at what looked like a bipedal turtle sitting in a pool of blood on the floor. The nurses were afraid to touch it. 

""My god, GET DOCTOR THOMPSON."" shouted one of the nurses. The other two rushed out of the room hollering for Dr. Thompson. ""This is impossible..."" stammered the lone nurse as she looked at the turtle baby sitting on the floor. 

Dr. Thompson rushed into the room. The nurse straightened herself out ""Doctor, this is patient April Harmony. Her baby..."" 
Thompson looked around the room slowly ""She goes by her middle name Susan..."" until his eyes fixed on the calmly sitting turtle baby. He carefully pointed what looked almost like a radar speed gun at the baby. The screen flickered a couple numbers then the whole thing lit up like police lights and he dropped the scanner. He whispered into a walkie talkie ""Code alpha. This is not a drill. Code alpha."" 

Brian's eyes did not move from the scanner. ""It's still scanning... it's still scanning... it's still scanning"" he murmured. The display was flashing brightly with a [01]",batslicecameltruck

The day of Birth comes once every 5 years, and only upon coming of age were we permitted to submit an application for having a child. 

Vaughn and I were lucky. Unlike many others, we had known each other since we were kids, grew up together and were best friends. Most of the people who were paired with Spouses were complete strangers. The System would select a boy and a girl, they were assessed at the age of 12. It was a week long testing process whereby our intelligence, personal attributes and personalities were all taken into consideration. 

1000 years ago, we were on the brink of extinction, due to overpopulation, and humans killing the planet. The Earth fought back, we were bombarded with aggressive viruses, which almost halved the world population within a span of 1 year. We saw more movement of the plates beneath the Earth's surface in the short span of 2 years then we had recorded in 10, earthquakes, tsunamis, the formation of new volcanoes, both beneath the surface of the sea and above it. These wiped out the cities that were neighbouring the sea, many people moved inland or underground. My ancestors saw this coming, and had been preparing for the day. Everyone who lives today all had relatives with Believers or had stemmed from the frozen eggs and sperm samples that were collected. Surprisingly, we had a lot of academics who thought the day would come, and we've been lucky to have them on board, otherwise we wouldn't be able to restart the human race. 

The records of what happened have been lost over time, I've been curious as to what my relatives would have recounted. Vaughn tells me not to let my mind wander, as the Govern wouldn't approve.

When Vaughn and I went for testing, we were terrified of being separated, we were scared that the Govern wouldn't think we were suited to each other. After all, the chances were slim, especially for those who had grown up knowing each other. We lived in the same faculty, our parents from similar academic backgrounds. 

I don't know when I fell in love with him, but I remember that day, when I watched as he was whisked away from my side, tears streamed down my face. I tried to run after him, but the Officers held me back. The testing process assessed my physical capabilities, intellect and personality. They kept me awake for days, forced me not to eat, made me hunt for my own food (I was too scared to kill anything, so I ate berries and plants that I had found), and assessed my ability to problem solve in various scenarios. My mother had always told me that I was stubborn, but I was no threat to anyone, I wouldn't hurt a fly. After the week long testing, I was reunited with Vaughn. I was so happy to have him by my side again, but he looked exhausted, bags under his eyes, and purple bruises beneath his sleeve, he tried to hide it, but I noticed it before he could. He gave me a weak smile, and I knew he didn't want to talk about it, so I didn't pry.

Three weeks had passed and the results were out. Vaughn and I stood infront of the board that towered over us, as we searched for our names. I held onto his arm as he exclaimed ""There I am!"" I closed my eyes tightly, wishing that we were paired. 

*Please be me, please be me, please be me*

""Aww damn, look who I'm paired with""

He nudges me,

""C'mon, open your eyes""

I open one eye, look at his face, and there's a tinge of disappointment,

*Oh no*

As I look up at the sheet, searching for his name, I finally found it.

There. Vaughn Iver.

As I trace across the line. There it is. His Spouse.

*What*

He looks at me with a mischievous smile, and I notice that tears have formed at the corners of my eyes.

""Why didn't you tell me that it was me! You looked so disappointed!""

He chuckled at me, ""Because this means that I'll be stuck with you forever!""

He ran off, and I chased after him. Not knowing what spouse really meant, aside from not being separated from my best friend, and that's all that really mattered.

It's been 13 years since then, and after a month of waiting, our application form was finally approved. We were permitted to have a child. Vaughn and I were over the moon. 

""Finally"" he breathed.

He sounded relieved, I let out a breath that I had unknowingly been holding in. 

He comes over to me and holds me ""We can have our own child"".

Our previous application 5 years ago had been rejected, and Vaughn was visibly upset. But I'm glad that it's finally been approved. Some of our neighbours already had children 5 years ago, Vaughn probably felt a bit out of place that his co-workers already had a child.

It was currently Law that all children had to be approved before conception, otherwise it would lead to termination of both the child and mother. The father was to live a life of suffering as it was one Spouse, for life. 

To combat the threat of humans to each other, technology had advanced dramatically, and upon the birth of each child, they were given a number, indicating their level of threat to humanity. I was over a billion and Vaughn was nearing two billion. The Govern weren't threatened by us, we were relatively docile. But I had heard of children being born of numbers below 200, these children were all flagged and closely monitored for any indication of violence or unusual behaviours.

Children below the Critical number were rumoured to be killed.

Vaughn wasn't concerned, but I was scared, about 8 months into the pregnancy,

""what if our child was below the Critical number?"" I asked him.

""It's not possible, don't worry about it"".

""It *is* possible Vaughn""

He sighs ""Yeah, but the chances are so slim""

""It still happens"" I press.

""Both our numbers are in the billions, the chances that our child is going to be any less then a billion is ridiculous""

""It still happens"" I sulk.

He walks over and holds me,

""Don't worry so much, we'll be okay, we're finally going to have our own child, we're so lucky""

I leave it at that, and cuddle him, trusting in him. We just didn't realise how *lucky* we'd be.

Not two weeks later and my contractions start, I begin to go into labour and there's no time to go to the Birthing building, instead, I ask my mother, who'd previously been a midwife for a short period of her life to help us with the birth of my child.

She gives me a drug to ease the pain and help the bones expand quicker. I pass out from the pain and exhaustion.

When I come to, my mother has my little one wrapped in a blanket, Vaughn is by my side.

""Mom? Vaughn?"" I weakly manage

""It's a boy!"" Vaughn exclaims

""I'll go get the Device, we didn't want to Number him without you"" my mother excitedly hurries off.

""Can I see him?"" I ask

Vaughn shows me our little miracle and smiles.

""He's adorable"" I say.

My mother comes back with a portable Device in hand, she places it near my baby's left wrist, not 30 seconds later, it glows red, indicating that a number has been assigned.

""Are you ready?"" she asks us.

Vaughn and I nod in unison, he squeezes my hand in support as if to say *don't worry*. I smile back at him to say *okay*

My mother turns the Device up to show us the number on the screen.

The room goes silent and the air is goes from warmth and excitement to still and cold.

The Device drops and shatters.

Vaughn, my mother and I are all speechless.

Vaughn looks at me in fear.

My mother holds me.

And I hold my baby tightly in my arms.

Tears begin to form at the corner of my eyes.

"[WP] At birth every one gets a number assigned to them which determines their threat to humanity. You are number 1,039,474,023. Your newlyborn son is born. His number is 1. This number has never been seen before in all of history.",Hazbro29,"  ""There has to be some kind of mistake,"" I said once again. I knew I was repeating myself, but I couldn't help it. My eyes drifted over to the small bassinet in the corner of the room, a blanket-covered bundle barely visible over the edge. I moved slightly to one side so I could no longer see. 

  My wife wasn't handling things at all well. She sat on her bed, staring blankly out of the window. The sounds of the hospital came through the door, muffled and indistinct. We were isolated, cut off from the rest of the world. Just me, my wife Sharon and... William. Our son. 

  I can't pretend to know all there is to know about the Threat Assessment Bureau, beyond their corny slogan—""We're keeping TABs on threats to humanity!"" There was a genetic test, coupled with predictive modeling and neurological mapping, but everyone knew that. I'd read through the documentation the TAB gave to us, but it didn't go in-depth on how they did anything. *Nobody* knew how they arrived at their numbers, though there was a lot of speculation. It was all a complete mystery. 

  ""There has to be some kind of mistake,"" I said again. Pointless, stupid, but I can't help myself. Sharon's eyes flick over to me then flinch off of the bassinet on their way back to staring blankly out the window. 

  I have no idea how long we waited before there was a gentle knock on the door. A moment later, and a pair of men came in, each dressed in sharp black suits. 

  ""Hello, there,"" one of the men said. ""Rodgers family, right? Thomas, Sharon and William."" 

  ""That's right,"" I said, my lips feeling numb. Sharon was still on the bed, but she wasn't looking at the window anymore. Instead, she was staring at the two men, her face stiff and unreadable. 

  ""Agent Anderson and Agent Halls, Threat Assessment Bureau,"" Anderson said, flashing an ID. His partner did the same. ""We're here to talk about your son."" 

  Panic gripped my chest. ""There has to be some kind of mistake,"" I said, desperately this time. 

  Anderson shook his head, a look of well-practiced sympathy on his features.  ""I can understand why you'd like to think so. But, no. I'm afraid there's no mistake, and the law is very clear."" 

  Of course it was clear. And, before William had been born, I believed in it completely. Humanity was divided up into ranges, each range divided up by how dangerous the TAB testing rated them. I was up in the billions, and so was Sharon. A person was ranked as ""Intermediate Danger"" at anything under a million. Anything under one hundred thousand was ""Immediate Threat"", and under a thousand was ""Highly Dangerous."" 

  William was a one. 

  ""How can you be so sure?"" I asked. ""He's just a baby!"" 

  ""Our tests are accurate,"" Agent Anderson replied. ""One hundred percent. I wish I could explain the science to you, but it's classified."" 

  ""You need to move away from the baby, sir,"" Agent Halls added.

  I suddenly realized that I had moved to place myself between the bassinet and the two agents. Not the best place to be, but I couldn't seem to shift myself. 

  ""No,"" Sharon said, grimacing as she pushed herself out of bed. ""I need... I need to know what you plan to do. I'm not going to let you hurt him!"" 

  ""Hurt him?"" Agent Anderson exchanged an amused glance with his partner. ""Why in the world would we *hurt* him?"" 

  Sharon looked as confused as I felt. ""But... he's a one. He's a threat..."" 

  ""No,"" Agent Anderson said. ""He's not *a* threat. He's *the* threat. Little William will be well cared for, believe me."" He smiled, then, and there was nothing of sympathy in his expression. ""We just have to make sure that threat is pointed in the right direction."" The smile vanished. ""Now, stand aside, sir. Please, don't make this difficult."" 

  My hands were clenching and unclenching at my side, my heart hammering. Cold rivers of sweat went down my spine. I exchanged a helpless glance with my wife, but in the end, I was defeated. I stepped aside. 

  There's a reason that those with numbers over a billion are ranked as ""Docile.""

  ""You've done the right thing,"" Anderson said. ""We'll take good care of him. And, trust me on this, your son will go far.""  

  William woke up when Agent Halls picked him up, staring up at him with that strangely intense gaze he had. William had never cried, not even once since he'd been born. It honestly freaked me out, and I can't say there wasn't a little bit of me that was relieved when the two agents said their farewells and left with my son. 

  Sharon started crying, and I sat on the bed next to her, trying my clumsy best to comfort her. Eventually, her tears faded, and we just sat there, staring out the window at the setting sun. 

  ""I think..."" she said eventually. ""I think we did the right thing, don't you?"" 

  We hadn't had a choice in the matter, but it was easier to think of it as a decision we'd made, so I agreed with her. ""I do,"" I said, trying not to think of what kind of monster we'd unleashed on the earth. ""I really, really do.""

""Mr. Pramod?"" George turned his head towards the nurse who was standing by the door with a grim face. 

""Wait here, I'll be back shortly."" George said with a reassuring smile to Gianna and she nodded in affirmation. George got off from his chair  and as soon as he faced the nurse his brows furrowed. He calmly pulled the nurse out of the room and closed the door behind him.

""Is something the matter? Is there any problems with my son?"" She held her arms close to her body and could only look away. ""Miss?""

""Uh.. Yeah, threat to humanity levels, maybe two hundred or so years ago.. Dr. Yuder developed an algorithm to assess these things."" With sudden realization his eyes were wide. ""My son? Walter? How high are his TH Levels?""

The nurse still uncertain stared at the man who had just became a father. Eyes filled with concern for what would become of his son. These TH levels over the years have been proven to be quite a reliable source of the fate of the person. And as of recent events, the government had chosen to act upon the TH levels. George's was 1,039,474,023 - nowhere close to the level to worry about. Even more so for his wife who had a number of 1,345,760,251.

Before the nurse could tell George what his son's TH levels were police officers rushed into the building. George looked bewildered as the officers rushed to George.

""George Pramod! You are under arrest!"" The officers forced his hands into cuffs and pushed him into the ground. 

From the one of the officer's radio he heard his partner buzz in: ""Room 372 is secure. The target has complied."" *Room 372*]*, That was Giana's

""What's going on here?! Miss! What happened to my son?!"" Though George did not resist the arrest he still called out to find out the fate of his son.

""Sir, you are under arrest under the new law set in place concerning TH levels. You have the right to remain silent.."" The officers voice began to fade as all his focus went to the nurse who grimly said:

""I'm sorry Mr. Pramod, Walter Pramod's TH level is **one**""

His whole body went slack and his face hit the floor with a loud thud. *One?* How could that be possible? Even as he was placed in the police car he stared blankly straight ahead thinking of the things that he and his wife had done.

""I'm sorry sir, but it's our job."" One of the cops looked into the car and reassured him, ""unfortunately we are required to do this. Please do not feel distressed. The government has assured that they would check multiple times. Just to ensure that the measurement is correct. And if not your son will be going home by tomorrow."" He looked away towards the hospital building, ""And should your son really have a TH level of one.. I hate to say it but it's most likely for the better."" He shut the door and they drove away with his wife behind them inside an ambulance

For the next month the government would review all the information that they had on the couple. All their past lovers, grades, previous occupations. They even went as far as to pull DNA from the two and added it to a library of data with only one binder in it.

By the end of the month their lives were practically over. Even with all the security, information leaked out. For the first time since the development of the algorithm, there was someone in the single digits. Their bosses had fired them, their insurance cut ties. Their fate was a grim one, as they spent the last hours of their lives resenting their son.

""And why does that concern me Walter?"" From the broken rooftop water dripped down, every few seconds making a sound in the dead silent city. Cars which were once on fire doused by the rainfall that had just stopped as he was telling his story. 

I sat on a school chair, uncomfortable, bulky, ""You know, I never went to school. It seemed like a lot of fun."" I stared blankly at him, *he did not understand the story did he?* 

I sighed, ""Who was it that tore that family apart? Who was it that placed hundreds of people behind bars before doing anything wrong? You know, my TH level being one. That means a lot, A threat to humanity, compare any one person against me and I will always be more dangerous. But did you ever stop to consider what would happen if I was against the millions? Their ill will would trump mine any day. And because I know how to control this bomb which is my life, I choose where I drop it. So at the very least, I will change the world for the better, destroy the others with ill intent who ruined our lives. I will most definitely be a threat to humanity as it is now. But fast forward in history and I will be known as the largest factor that turned this world for the better.""",AppsleTurtle

This number has never been seen before in all of history.",Hazbro29,"7 years ago, I had created the technology of Neural Mapping. After a fully constructive brain map had been created, every person's level of threat could have been shown. It had been a massive breakthrough, one that would change humanity forever - a person's level of threat could be assessed, and everyone had a number that had represented a person's level of threat against humanity. 

No one knows, but I had always been 1st. Until now. 

I had worked on an A.I for the last 7 years. To be able to genetically modify and design your offspring - it was amazing. And that's what we did. Some people may consider morbid or cruel, but what can they say to me, who had secured my child's future - to be a happy, kind, extremely intelligent and successful man? 

I watched as the baby had come out, eyes glowing bright. Yet unlike every baby that had been born into this world, he had smiled - a bright, innocent smile. And with it, a number started forming above his head. It was a 1. With that number, fear had penetrated through me, suffocating me with terror. I scrambled to the nearest scanner, and scanned myself. I was the number 1,049,474,023. The fake number I myself had come up with. I was baffled. My sole reason of being number 1 was the fact that I would've had Jesus? I gulped. Yet fervor took me. I will keep him alive, and change his number myself. 

So, I lived the next 17 years as an outcast. Dodging police officers, and with everyone's mental maps, it wasn't hard. Our family lived a fairly leisurely life without much trouble. After all, I literally knew what everyone was thinking. Yet that didn't stop our prosecution. We were constantly hunted and attempted to be assasinated. 

My son had started to dab in technology. Powerful technology. Around the same tech tree as me, but I didn't care. My neural mapping was the only one I didn't understand, but this was not even theorizable. This fervor and zeal I was taken by to protect my son - at any cost - even humanity, was baffling. 

Yet as years went by, my son had begun to fit into this world. Humanity was constantly at war, and was on the verge of destruction. Earth was being destroyed, and humanity had sent it's best scattering. The best had tried to create a sustainable ecosystem and permanent space travel, but technology was simply not there.

I woke up to an intense pain. Agony spiked through my arm, as a howled. I saw my son over me, holding me down. I looked down to see a syringe in my arm. A glowing substance was pumping through me. What the hell? Gritting my teeth, I said: ""What are you doing"". 

He replied with ""Saving you""

And the pain ended. A weak throbbing was still there, but I felt... different. I got angry. God damn it why couldn't he just ask me!? I felt angry at him, and I had a sudden desire to fling something at him. The knife plunged his way. But I hadn't touched it. Then, a force had stopped me.

""Learn to control it"". Jesus had said. 
""What the hell?!"" 
""I changed you on a molecular basis. Give it a few minutes and you should see massive changes"". 

And I did. Our family had become a different species. Soon we had taken control over humanity. But for the better. Distributing this drug, we had made a separate species entirely. With brainpower incomprehensible to the former humanity, and abilities that had been inconceivable, humanity had bonded together. Advancements and revolutions of our former lifestyle had happened. Everyone had unified together.

Humanity had ended due to Jesus. We were called Exterra. Extra terrestrial - more than just earth.

But our little boy is number 1, and he is the nicest little boy, well young man, you will ever meet. He is just nice and honest. I have never caught him in a lie, never seen him fight in anger. Must be all that meditation and martial arts he does.  

But sometimes he is scary, it's like he knows something and he doesn't like it.  It scares him more then anything. His hidden fear and I think I have finally found out what it is. I found something last night.  It was something he had written.  A speech with the a note "" How  rally people behind a any idea""  After I read it I understood. The speech was empty of content but it didn't matter.  i would follow the speaker to the death for it. ",Engletroll

Brian and Susan Harmony had always been normal people who lived a nice normal life. They met in high school, dated through college, married two years after graduating, and settled down in a small town in North Carolina.

Susan was a Women's Studies major who at first spent much time volunteering at rape crisis and suicide prevention centers. She had always been kind-hearted and a help to all humanity, with her threat-level assigned at 5,432,109,876. When she learned of her pregnancy however, she decided to put an end to her volunteering efforts and focus all her attention at being the best stay-at-home mom there was.

Brian was a little more dangerous, his threat-level assigned at 1,039,474,023. He landed a job at a top accounting firm as a CPA and dealt with in-house auditing of high-level corporations. 

Neither Brian or Susan had ever met anyone with a threat-level assignment under 1,000,000,000. To be fair, the top 15% of threat-level assignments were kept anonymous by governments worldwide, as these were the most dangerous people alive. In fact, the top 100 were said to be a greater threat than threatening a nation with a nuclear weapon. No one knew why these individuals were so menacing, but prayed they would never need to find out.

While Brian was certainly a more dangerous individual than most, you would never know it when interacting with him. In fact, Brian &amp; Susan were known as the nicest couple most people met. Of course, this all changed the day Susan felt a strange sensation in her stomach.",vundervat

Sure it depends on your upbringing, your location, your religion, traumatic events in your life, etc. If this society killed all the people who had a possibility of becoming dangerous, no one would be survive. In Karen's case, she had let's say a 1/3,500,000,000 (realistically there would be several bad outcomes and not just one, but for the sake of conversation) chance of becoming dangerous. Would you kill someone on those odds? Or a more dangerous individual, prone to violence and raised poor might have a 10,000/1,000,000,000 chance of becoming violent, would you kill someone on those odds?

Even with technology that can predict every possible outcome in your life, it can't predict with certainty, your actions before you commit them, because as a human you make choices.

In a 5 minute conversation you make 1000's of choices, some conscious, some unconscious: 

Say something

Say something else

Breathe

Blink

Listen

Interrupt

Walk away

And as this conversations goes on, more options might develop, options might develop based on your surroundings, who you're talking too. Obviously you have the option to shoot, stab, strangle, beat with a brick, rob, etc, but that doesn't mean you're going to do it even .00000000001% of the time...

This number has never been seen before in all of history.",Hazbro29,"All our lives, we're assigned numbers. Numbers that determine who we are. What we're worth to our society. Anything from the unchanging social security number we get assigned to at birth to the GPA and SAT scores that we're told will determine the rest of our lives. But there's one number that we all have to live with. Numbers that determine who presents the most threat to humanity. Who could harm the most people if given the chance.

I am 1,039,474,023. Seems pretty harmless, but in a world of 7.3 billion, I am more dangerous than over 6.2 billion people. Kind of concerning. The worst part is, I don't remember hurting anyone. It makes me wonder what I've done that I had no idea about. Who I've hurt. Of course, in our society, it takes a certain amount of work and assertiveness to get what you want. That girl you like? Talk to her and crush the competition. That job you want? Apply to it and crush the competition.

When the threat scans were enacted, the most common argument was ""What would you do if your son was number 1?"" The baby is already born, so you can't abort. It hasn't done anything yet, so locking it up somewhere is illegal. It was one of those slippery-slope arguments we hear about all the time. When the individual grows older, their numbers become more important. People with a certain number aren't allowed to purchase firearms or go to an airport. In a court of law, these numbers are picked apart by lawyers and judges. A man with a number of 3G is going to get less time than a man who was 900K over the same crime.

There's nothing I can do about it now. People with numbers of 1G or less tend to get labeled as potential rioters. The best thing I can do is lead a silent protest and live my life in peace. My number doesn't bother me that much, to tell you the truth, nor does anybody else's. I don't think about it much and I never considered it to be important. Even when I heard those magic words, ""I'm pregnant,"" I never thought about my son's number.

Sometimes in life, there are moments that are so profoundly shitty, you just don't believe them. The reading of my son's threat number was my unbelievable moment. Hell, the doctor was more scared than I was. I still remember that look on his face, the color draining from his skin. He scanned. And rescanned. And then got another scanner. And then got more doctors to scan my son. And then they went into the back room and spread the word around the hospital. Interns on their first day heard my son's number before I did. Finally, the Chief of Medicine approached me as I watched my son in the infant ward.

""One. Your son's number is one,"" he said. We both stared at my son through the glass. Who were we really looking at? The guy who would give Hitler a run for his money? A president who would throw the world into a nuclear apocalypse? A brilliant scientist who would accidentally destroy the human race? Whoever he grew up to be, we were looking at the most dangerous person in the world. Wasn't long after that the media showed up, trying to get a look at the most dangerous person in the world and the man who would raise him.

So, when you ask me that damn question... ""What would you do if your son was number 1?"" I'll tell you what I'd do. What I did. I took my son home to raise him. And I loved every second of it.",Dictator4Hire

Within an hour, what looked like a bomb squad had formed around the door of the room. Brian was clutching Susan's hand. Her heart rate was slowing and she was losing blood quickly. One of the squad called from the door in a booming voice ""Please remain calm. What is the full name of the mother?"" 

""Her name? Susan Harmony! You assholes get us some help!"" Brian replied. ""Give us the Full name and maiden name immediately"" the squad leader said with a threatening tone. 

""April Susan Harmony, maiden name O'Neil!"" cried Brian

""My god sir. It's really April O'Neil in there."" said another squad member. ""That fucking slut has doomed us all!"" another yelled. ""CALM DOWN, PRIVATE! This is a confirmed code alpha, prepare your weapons"" shouted the squad leader. 

Brian sat there with his eyes wide open, he had let go of Susan's hand. ""What are they talking about darling?"" stammered Brian. 
Susan weakly tilted her head to look Brian in the eye ""I'm so sorry honey... You're not the father."" she whispered with tears in her eyes. ""What... what do you mean... We've been together forever. You mean there was someone else? What the fuck is going on???"" Brian replied with a fury building up inside him. ""Kill that fucking thing!"" He shouted, hardly believing the words coming out of his own mouth. 

""...Cowabunga motherfuckers."" a small voice came out of nowhere

""What? Who said that?"" said Brian, looking around the room until he stopped on the baby. 

""I said, COWABUNGA!!"" the turtle baby roared as he moved faster than a flash of light to duck under the bed. 

""Holy shit how can it move that fast... EVERYONE WEAPONS DRAWN, READY TO FIRE. IT IS UNDER THE BED"" barked the squad leader. 

The whole room went quiet except for guns cocking ready to fire. Brian was backed up against the wall, shaking. Susan was weakly crying in the bed and the entire squad was circled around her with their guns pointing downward. 

""CHILL OUT DUDES"" came a booming, radical voice as the turtle baby flew out from under the bed, expertly twisting his body to block the incoming gunfire with his turtle shell. The bullets ricocheted into 2 of the 6 squad members heads, killing them instantly. 

""FIRE FIRE FIRE"" shouted the squad leader. The turtle baby moved faster than anything they had ever seen before. Before the squad members could even point their guns at the baby, it had moved right behind them. The baby jumped up and smashed two of the squad members' heads together with such force that pieces of brain came flying out of their skull. 

""My god, Fucking kill it!!"" the squad leader shouted hysterically. 

The turtle baby leapt behind the other squad member, positioning him in front of the squad leader's gun fire. 5 bullets pumped into the squad member until his body became a lifeless sack of meat falling to the floor. 

""No, god no, someone save us!"" cried the squad leader as he scrambled to reload his gun. 

The turtle baby was already upon him. Before he knew what was happening, the squad leader had been tackled to the floor with the turtle baby face to face with him. ""Surf's up, dude."" whispered the turtle baby as he held onto the squad leader's shoulders with his hands, propelling himself forward to perform a decapitating kick with both legs. The squad leader's head flew off from his body and the turtle baby rode it like a surfboard as it slid on all the blood that had amassed in the room. 

He came to a stop at Brian's feet. Brian had been cowering with fear next to the wall for the whole ordeal. He became frozen solid as the turtle baby got closer to him. Brian turned to run, but the turtle baby gave him a swift punch to the side, snapping his ribs and causing some internal bleeding. 

The turtle baby was now upon Susan's bed. She calmly looked at it and said ""I should have listened to Rafael.""

Never before has any single person received a number so low, yet here he is. The future bane of the human race, yawning ever so slightly as I cradled him in my arms.

It has been almost 6 decades since his birth. And he grew up to be a successful man: a world-renowned activist, defender of justice, with a loving family, and a squadron of trusted friends. He is loved by all who know him. His radical actions has changed the face of our planet, single-handedly enforcing the rights of all those oppressed. A period of peace unlike that of anything known in history has begun, all thanks to him.

I shrugged. 'I suppose so.'
Suspicion hung in the air. 'You know something, do you? Pray tell us, so we may avoid cataclysm.'
I laughed. These old crows know nothing. ''Tis too late. The world is already his. There is nothing you can do.'

When they wrapped him in a blanket and set him gently on my chest, I stared deeply into his eyes and I could see the stars in them, the galaxies in the depths of his pupils. He became the entirety of my universe. The love I felt for him swelled with each inhale; I watched him rise and fall with my every breath and his eyes stayed locked on mine. He wrapped his little hand around my fingers and looking at the dark digits twinkling from the back of my hand, I wondered what number he would start with. *You'll always be my number 1,* I thought. *Always.*

""In a moment.""  I whispered softly, since he had fallen asleep. I was caught up admiring his few golden curls atop his perfect head. *This is my son, my beautiful son.*

""Miss, you said that an hour ago. I must get measurements and start his assessments. He also needs to be sterilized. You as well."" The charge nurse stood with her arms crossed and a sullen expression glued to her face, her eyebrows creased in the middle of her forehead. I looked back down at him. 

""He's asleep."" I sighed. I watched his eyelids flutter lightly as his eyes danced beneath them and I wondered if in his dreams he breathed underwater.

""We'll wake him. It's imperative. Please comply with my request."" The nurse's posture seemed agitated, but her tone was dull and bored, as if this was an expected part of her routine yet she still loathed the exchange. I couldn't bring myself to look at her anymore. 

""Will he stay in here?"" I asked. 

""No. Testing is in room 343. It is a locked room. You are not permitted to participate or view testing. It will take approximately twenty minutes to complete."" 

She paused. I felt the silence pressing in around us, insulating me in my complete entrancement with this new life that I held in my arms. I felt the weight of the nurse's demands dissipate in the air around us; finally I heard her turn and walk away. I felt my own tiredness weighing on my eyelids. As I fell asleep, he was the last thing I saw. 

When I awoke, he was gone. 

It was cold in the white emptiness of the birthing room and though there was no perceptible movement of air, I shuddered. I was in fresh linen and new bedclothes without having been stirred even minutely from my sleep; the efficiency of the hospital never ceased to amaze me. 

""Where is my child?"" I asked the empty room. 

""Testing. Room 343."" Came the automated response from the monitoring unit. 

""When will I have him?"" 

""Unknown."" *Unknown?* I thought, *How could it be unknown?* The world no longer operated in unknowns. Whatever had potential to happen was easily ascertained, the most logical and pragmatic option then chosen, and everything in life went according to plan. Here I was: room 543 at age 21 years, 3 months, 12 days, to give birth to a male child on this exact date at 10:02 am. Exactly as planned. 

The love I felt for him, though, I had not anticipated. My heart beat began to quicken. 

""Where is my son?"" I asked again. 

""Testing."" Came the same reply. 

""Why is it unknown when I will see him?"" 

""Unknown."" 

""What do you mean unknown?"" I demanded. I stood up, blood pumping to my ears. I had never felt such uncontrollable fear, such worry and need all at once. My chest almost hurt the way my heart was pounding against my rib cage. *I need to see my son.* 

""Abnormal heart rhythm, elevated blood pressure, heart rate detected. Recommended that patient remain supine. Please return to-"" 

""SHUT UP!"" I yelled. ""Open this door.""

""Action not recommended at this time; please standby for physician-""

""Open it!"" I said again. I jumped when the door actually opened and I started to walk out of the room, only to realize that two physicians were blocking the way. 

""What are you doing out of bed?"" One on the left asked. He had a digital chart in his left hand and had already looked back down at it before he'd even finished speaking. The other physician looked bored, staring off into the distance with his arms crossed. 

""Where's my son?"" I demanded. My heart continued to pound. 

""Miss,"" began the bored looking physician, ""you're currently non-compliant; out of bed without prior authorization, your heart rate is elevated, as is your blood pressure. I expect you to-"" 

""WHERE IS HE? MY SON! WHERE IS MY SON!"" I screamed as I rushed towards them. They froze in shock as I lunged at them and pushed them into each other. Their digital screens fell and shattered across the floor. ""I WANT TO KNOW WHERE HE IS! WHERE-"" 

""MISS! STOP YELLING!"" Interrupted the first one, holding up a hand to silence me. I held my breath as they stood, brushing themselves off. ""Your son,"" he continued, ""has been terminated due to his threat level being incompatible with allowable life. The risk was too great. You understand."" He nodded as he spoke, as if his words were the most obvious thing. As if it was just acceptable and anticipated and not completely unknown. 

*My son is dead.* I thought to myself. *My son is dead.* I felt rage boiling in my veins. *How could my son be dead? My beautiful child, my beautiful boy. How can this be?* I felt the anger shaping in my chest, growing with every breath, as it consumed me. 

I jumped at them, felt the world slip away as my hands closed around one of their throats and blackness fell around me. 

When I regained control I was on the floor, shaking. My heart still pounding and pulse racing. They were all dead. *I killed them all.* I thought. Then, as if from somewhere deep within me, the thought came, *I don't care.* 

""They killed my baby."" I said aloud to the empty room, occupied now by only the bodies of the previously living. 

I bent down to pick up the blanket, the one that they had wrapped him in only a few hours ago and held it tightly in my hand. Tears fell slowly as I realized that I couldn't have my baby. I'd never hold him again. *I will make them pay. All of them will pay.*

I wiped the tears from my eyes and the dark digits caught my eye.

There has been so much widespread panic over security and terrorism, that we have abandoned our freedoms. 

After the mapping of the neural pathways was successfully completed, a program called Destiny (not the game) soon followed. Destiny is a brain scan that plays out every possible event and outcome in your life, and averages all of the possibilities to generate a threat level. What this means is that, even if in .01% of outcomes you become a crazed murderer, your average will still be good. 

Personally, my number registered somewhere around 1 billion, and my wife Karen is in the 3.2 billion range, so we're both considered *safe*. Anyone under 200 million is subject to near constant surveilance. 

After about 3 years of happy marriage, Karen and I were about to have our first kid. The birth was normal, but nothing I want to get into detail about. The only thing we had to do was wait for the scans and tests to come back, and we would be all set to see our baby. Personally, I was more nervous than excited, but the looks of joy on my wife's face made it worth it for me.

""Honey, the test results are here"" I said, as the doctor walked back in holding a clipboard. The look on his face was what got me. It didn't show anything was wrong, but something about it looked... *confused?*

I asked the doctor if something was wrong, and he looked at me with sad eyes, and said ""I'm sorry. Your son is dead"" 

I was shocked at the news. When he was born he was healthy, appeared healthy, and had no problems... so how could he be dead? 

The doctor looked at my wife and I apologetically, but then broke down crying. He thrust the clipboard towards us, where the average threat level displayed a #1, followed by the message ""terminate immediately"".

I handled the loss pretty well, but my poor wife couldn’t deal with it. For months after his death she would just stare blankly at the wall. Every so often she’d go out to bars and drink her sorrows away or go grocery shopping. It seemed like today was one of those days.

I sat down on my sofa and turned on the news. The major breaking story today was of a terrorist attack at the nearby hospital. The whole building was burned to the ground after an apparently violent shooting. At least 250 dead, over 2000 with minor wounds and many more in critical condition. Yeesh... that sounds horrible. As I was watching the news I heard the sound of keys turning, and Karen walked into the house. ""Hey honey, have you seen the news? The hospital was burned to the ground in a terrorist attack."" I told her.

She replied saying she hadn’t seen it and quickly went back to putting away the groceries. 

On her shoulder there lay a single piece of ash.

The nurse abruptly entered to the wait room, with the ultrasounds results

-We have good and bad news

Weirded out, he said:

-Lets start with the good ones.

-You will have twins.

He almost fell from the chair,Shocked and happy at the same time. The couple waited so much to have their son, and now it was a 2x1

Even then, something was wrong. He asked:

-Then what are the bad news?

She was seemingly nervous, as she whispered.

-One, as you, has a very high Treath number. The other one, however...

-What?

-... Has a treath number of one.

The father stayed quiet, as she said what he already knew.

-You will only have one child. The other one will be executed

He cried,as he didnt understand how could this possibly be happening.

-A WEEK LATER-

The father was a coward. He didnt want to see my childs being born, knowing that he will never see one of them.

Everything was heard . The nurse instructions. The doctor struggle. The wife screaming. 

And suddenly, silence.

A few moments later, the nurse came, with the two babies in her arms, and a gun on her belt.

-I know this is rough for you, but it must be done. Take your son, and say goodbye to his brother.

He took the child, wich i named Luz, and said goodbye, in tears, to his other son.

He didnt even had a name, as he knows it will only increase the pain

The nurse left with him, and a shot was heard in the distance. He had to stay strong. For Luz

-18 YEARS LATER-

Luz was quietly listening to his father story. He was filled with anger. His brother didnt deserve to be taken down. The machine was probably wrong, and he was willing to prove it

That night, he went to the hospital, and asked to see the nurse, the same one that put down his brother. He took the gun from his belt and shot her.

The blood was everywhere. He felt oddly nice. The justice was running on his veins, and suddenly felt that he could, by himself, destroy the humanity that took his brother away from him

This number has never been seen before in all of history.",Hazbro29,"When my son was born the world shuddered. I could see the Hippocratic oath straining under the weight of the greater good in the doctors' eyes. A cold sweat. A nervous twitch or cough here and there. Silence. The air itself seemed heavy with the question: should we kill this baby here and now? Why risk the world for one more child? I would be lying if I told you I didn't consider it as well.

When I see him, though, he isn't #1 or a threat... he is my son; David. They preach the importance of the number. Entire semesters of college cover the risk analysis methods. It is all real provable science. I believe the method, and have even voted to terminate other ""lows."" Now my son is the lowest of all, and all my learning is powerless before my love as a father.

If the doctors aren't willing to kill him themselves they are at least willing to tell the world. They might as well have twisted the knife and gotten it over with. While pondering the situation I see a news van approach, and know I have to act. I run to delivery where my wife was left knocked out. How will she react to this? In looking through the window at him a sudden realization washes over me. If I stand here and do nothing then the inevitable media circus will cause a riot. Once people congregate the decision is made. It will be out of my control.

My son will die.

It would be so easy. I could move on with my wife and my life. We could rest knowing that we did the right thing and perhaps even saved the world. Then again, who would want to save a world that would insist on killing such a peaceful innocent child as this. Slowly and gently I bend over and brush my wife's hair back. I linger in the smell of her shampoo and the warmth of her lips for as long as I dare, before briskly walking next door and swaddling David.

Ducking from room to room and never lingering for long I manage to make it to the lobby area. I snap the tracking band on David's ankle, which sets of an alarm. With strange camera people swarming the building, and a stolen baby alarm going off... well lets just say chaos has it's advantages. I open a back alley exit from the hospital and there stands the doctor who delivered David. 

Around his feet is a small pile of cigarette butts. ""I often wondered what this meant"" he said, pointing at his own wrist, where the number 103,415 was written. ""Now I know. I won't allow society to interfere with my oath to 'cause no harm.' I wonder if history will remember me that way... Get out of here. Now.""

So I am running. I run with David, and now his legs are strong. I hunt with him and now he knows self sufficience. I lead him into the valleys, and now he knows the land. I cry with him when his mother pleads for us to come home to his death, and now he is resolved. I hide with him, and now he can be invisible. I love him deeply, and now he knows compassion. I stand with him among friends and enemies, and now he has an army.

Maybe he is a threat to this world, but maybe that is exactly what this world needs.",DoxieDoc

The sky was foggy and grey. The breeze smelled of soot and death. He knew that the rest humanity would soon be extinguished.

He came to his destination, a statue standing amidst the destruction. Though vandalized and crumbling, the depicted man missing an arm and the cherubic visage of the woman obscured with cheap paint and specks of human blood, the words imprinted beneath them told onlookers exactly who they were.

""Elizabeth and Joseph Faber

Innate Threat Designations 7,003,976,618 and 1,039,474,023, Respectively

At God's Right Hand They Rest""

They were his parents.

Alexander gazed at the face of his father's likeness. The man who imprisoned him for decades. The man who sought to protect the human race from his son. The man who failed to do so.

He carefully cupped his mother's cheek. The woman who visited him every day. The woman who trusted that he could be more than his number. The woman who died in his cell.

Once beacons of hope in an uncertain world, the death of Eliza Faber marked the beginning of the end. Humanity practically destroyed itself without their saint to guide them. Panic took hold. Citizens boarded up their windows and locked themselves away. Many would rather die quietly in their homes than see what the man with ITD 1 had in store. Joseph was one of them, found dead by his own hands at his wife's place of rest.

It wasn't long after that society crumbled. It was small outbreaks of hysteria at first, escalating to citywide rioting, worldwide conflict, the impact of nuclear weaponry, and eventually the death of a civilization, all while Alexander watched. Watched as people trembled and fell beneath him. Watched as they begged for mercy and were consumed in flames.

He sat at the feet of his stone progenitors, and he knew that the rest of humanity was gone. He recalled his life of pain and imprisonment. He recalled the day his mother died. The look of fear in her eyes, knowing what life this would make for her child. It was an accident, he cried, an accident! She knew, she told him. She knew.

This number has never been seen before in all of history.",Hazbro29,"I lit up a cigarette.  New habit after spawning this little monster.  I still couldn't believe it, my daughter had earned a threat level of 1.  Her mom had died in child birth, a fitting birth for what might well become the end of humanity.  My level was somewhere around 1 billion, relatively normal.  My wife?  Well, she had been somewhere around 5 billion.  You would have been hard pressed to find a more gentle soul in humanity.  But this thing?  Do I even call her human?  Well, she's different.

In the past, a few have ranked in the 100,000 range, and a few high profile world and empire leaders have been psycho-analyzed from their actions to give approximate guesses as to what their level would be.  Julius Caesar had ranked around 1500, Alexander the Great had ranked in the 1000s, Harry Truman ranked around 90, while Hitler ranked in the 200s.  The argument for the difference being that Truman allowed the use of a weapon that could end humanity, while Hitler ""merely"" sought to create a master race.  These days, it was common for world leaders to have ranks in the 10,000s, occasionally a leader of a nuclear armed country might sit as low as 3,000, indicating a higher level of risk with their decisions.  

Numbers under 1,000 theoretically indicate an ability to reduce diversity of the human genome by significant amounts.  Numbers under 100 indicate a high risk of decision making that could directly result in either the end of humanity or the destruction of vital resources.  No one could even dream of what would result in a risk threat of 1.  

Fortunately, the government had offered a fair amount of guidance, as much as they could to help me with this girl.  Money wasn't an issue.  Our entire goal was going to be to get her through life without her snapping or getting enough power to be dangerous.  

I've sat in this position for the last 14 years, a few government agents have grown to be like a live-in family with us, not that Lexi knows that's what they are.  We've tried to keep outside influences limited while giving her a normal life.  For what almost certainly will be the end of humanity, she's a sweet girl.  Hormones have gotten her out of whack, but that happens to every adolescent her age. Her high school is the high school that the children of senators and other elites go to.  Every one of them has been instructed not to mention the ranking system, any kind of television or anything else.  We filter out television to keep rankings quiet as well as limit subversive messages.  

I've said all that to say this, yesterday was career day.  When asked what Lexi wanted to do, she picked a normally inconsequential answer: President of the United States.

What was the apocalypse, really, if not a reason for people to drink? He walked inside, and the second unsurprising thing that he noticed was that there were people drinking. *Of course*, he thought. *Nothing else to do right about now*. Then, he began seeing things that *did* surprise him. First of which, there were only four people drinking. He found that odd. Surely people didn't want to die alone huddled up in there house? Surely *someone* lived alone and wanted drinking/dying buddies? The next surprising thing he saw was that the four men drinking at a table were the *only* people in the bar. Where was the bartender? Where was *anybody?*

It was then that Martin noticed that the four men, who until now had been drinking, laughing and yelling, seemingly without a care in the world, had grown silent and taken to staring at him. Martin now had the chance to look them over. All four of them were of impressive to behold. They were sitting at the bar  surrounded by countless empty glass bottles. The one closest to me wore a set of black robes that looked heavy and thick enough to be velvet. They reach his feet, which were bare. The skin that Martin could see was white, almost like flour, and his face was set in an expression of solemnity.

 The man next to him looked like a muscle-building cancer patient. His tattered clothes hung loosely on a body of tight nit muscle, but his skin radiated a feeling of sickness like a nuclear explosion. He had no hair to speak of anywhere, and 
his eyes were sunken into his skull in and blank. 

On *his* left sat a man who looked like he belonged in the Middle Ages. He was in a full suit of golden plate armor, with black leather on underneath. His helmet was next to him on bar. It was a golden galea, with a face mask in a permanent steel battle cry. His sword was leaning against chair. 

The last companion was dressed in a blue business suit that simply roared ""expensive"". His cufflinks were golden eagles with eyes of what appeared to be rubies. His shoes were black, definitely leather.

Martin felt somehow out of place in his simple, brown jacket, faded jeans and hightop shoes, so he did the only thing he felt made any sense. He grabbed the bottle from his pocket and held it up. This elicited a violent cheer from the four strange men, who offered him a chair at the bar. He set the bottle on the bar, sat next to the man in the suit and began reaching for some glasses when the suit grabbed the fifth and took a gulp. He passed it on to the guy in the armor, and so on, until they passed it back down the line to Martin

""So what's your stories,"" he asked the four of them. He couldn't help his curiosity. It wasn't everyday you met a group of characters such as these! It wasn't every day that the world was ending, either. ""You four in town for a festival, or
something?""

The man in the armor laughed. It was deep and full of heart, like he was finally doing what he knew he always should have. ""Why, we're the Horsemen! I'm War, That's Famine,"" he gestured towards the man in the tattered clothes. ""That'll be
Death on the end there. Old bag'o'bones, that one!"" He laughed and took a giant gulp of the bottle before passing it on 
to Famine. ""And this here's Con-""

""I can introduce myself, thank you, War,"" the man in the suit interrupted. He turned to me and offerred his hand. ""Conquest.
A pleasure, surely, Mr....""

Martin took his hand, laughing, and shook it. ""Name's Martin. What kind of crazy get together were you all headed to, before the world went to shit, anyway,"" he asked them. The four of them looked at each other brightly and laughed.

""The Apocolypse, friend,"" Famine said, before taking a hearty sip of booze. ""We're finally ending what She started"" He handed the bottle to Death, who took a swig and handed it back to Martin.

""Wait, you mean you all are the...the four horsemen of the *Apocolypse?*"" Martin laughed and reached for the bottle from Death. He brought the glass to his lips and swallowed. Handing the bottle off to Conquest, he said, ""And...what, you're telling me God himself sent you to-""

Conquest stopped him. ""Herself"" Another swig. He passed it to War.

Martin grinned. ""Riight, God *her*self....sent all of *you* to end the world?""

Death grabbed the bottle from Famine looked up at Martin. ""You sound as if you lacked faith,"" he said. His voice sounded empty, and it sent chills down Martin's spine just to hear it. Death took a pull on the bottle and handed it back to him.

""Well, you gotta admit, I mean...it all sounds so farfetched...""  Swig. Pass.

War chuckled. ""Why do you think the destruction hasn't reached here yet? Cause we've been in here drinking! Celebrating!"" He grabbed the bottle from Conquest and chugged the last of it. When he was finished he threw it at the wall and let forth a laugh that could have shaken the building. 

Martin jumped behind the bar and grabbed another bottle. Unplugging it, he handed it to Famine, who nodded. ""So if what you're claiming is true,"" He began, ""Why are you in here getting drunk instead of out there, razing cities and...and claiming pure souls or whatever it is you do?""

The four of them gave a collective chuckle. Famine spoke up: ""You don't seriously expect four holy weapons to single-handedly destroy the entire world, do you?"" He chuckled.

""We have agents that do a lot of the work, around the clock"" said Conquest. ""We only attend personally to matters of particular disgrace and corruption, such as America and North Korea.""

Death handed the bottle back to Martin who took a pull and thought for a moment. ""Wait,"" he said. ""Then why are you here? Why aren't you in some tyrannical african-country, killing dictators and sending slaves to heaven?"" He handed the bottle Conquest. 

""Haven't you looked around you recently,"" put in Death. ""This place is a cesspool of corruption and sin. A breeding grounds for evil and unholiness. *That* is why we are here!""

He laughed a little. ""Well, you're not really wrong there."" He looked at war. ""So this is for real? The Rapture, God's war with the Devil, Angels...the whole nine yards?"" Martin was beginning to feel the effects of all the friendly drinking.

Famine smiled. ""Oh yeah. We've been on hold for Millennia. You can't imagine how good it feels to really be out again!"" He had the bottle, so he drank and passed it on to Death.

""Sure, we do get to see action every once in a while,"" Conquest chimed in. ""The Roman Empire? That was all me!""

""You're kidding,"" said Martin, jumping back across the bar and retaking his seat. He looked at War with a grin. ""Let me guess...World War II?""

War smiled and shrugged. ""Well, that *was* Death and My busiest couple of years, but my best work was your American Civil War. Family against family, a nation in turmoil, struggling amidst a devastating conflict with itself, so much drama, so much heart."" 

Death passed Martin the bottle and he finished it. He nearly set it in the trashcan, until he remembered where he was, and who he waswith, and threw it against the wall instead. To his dismay, it didn't shatter as expected, although it did make a rather loud noise as it clanged to the floor. He jumped as it bounced against the floor. He turned around, grabbed another bottle and opened it. ""So how does 
this all work?"" he asked them. ""All the 'good' people just, what, disappear? Do they die?""

Death recieved the bottle and took a drink. ""My department deals with ascendance,"" he said. ""One of my legions of agents comes to you and escorts you to the gates.""

Martin looked at him strangely. ""Your....department?""

Conquest nodded. ""Think of us as heads of corporations. My corporation has to do with conquer and expansion of civilization. We initiate certain conflicts and influence who gains sovereign power, to name one responsibility."" He handed the bottle to Famine, who raised it slightly.

""Just as I am in charge of the spread of disease and poverty. The Black Death, The Great Depression, The Dark Ages, these were 
all born out of my direct influence"" He took a gulp and passed on to Death. 

""We all do important things, is what we're really tryin to say,"" said War.

"[WP] One day, without warning, all ice on earth suddenly became more dense than liquid water and sunk to the bottom of wherever it was floating. How would the world react?",Kiloueka,"""But Bob -"" Bob Carol held up a hand, silencing his friend as three passengers got on from a small dingy boat. It had happened, the ice caps melted and now beaches were swallowing coast line cities. Bob was lucky enough to own a small charter boat, big enough to hold fifty, sea rat was her name. They were already at fourty passengers and the sides of the boat weren't too far away from the oceans surface. 

Sea Rat chugged on, bubbles frothing behind as the small vessel sliced through the expansive blue around them. ""Bob if we take any more on, we might. . ."" His wife began, too afraid to say the word. His friend Martin nodded, giving him a glare.

Bob turned back to the sea, hands on the wheel. Unlike people the ocean made sense to him, he was born in water and he damn sure would go out in it too. 

""Bob?"" Mariah asked. 

""Mm?"" ""We can't take anymore people in. . ."" 

Raising an eyebrow, Bob turned to her. ""I heard you the first time."" 

""Promise me?"" ""What?"" 

Sighing, she stood closer, inches away as she spoke the words, ""Promise me that if you see any stragglers, you'll drive on."" 

""I can't-"" ""Bob, we won't make it if you don't.""

He grumbled, focusing on the waters. That was when he saw them, four bodies lying on a yellow car as it floated, nearly submerged. There were two adults and two children, Bob felt his stomach drop. 

He lowered the lever on the boats throttle. ""Bob, no."" Markah rested a hand on his, holding the throttle in place. He turned to her and then to the boat behind him, they all avoided his gaze, thinking the same thing. 

Grumbling, Bob looked away from the stragglers and drove the boat on. He could hear them as they went past, they all could. As they moved into new territory the cries grew get behind them in the distance. His heart ached, Bob felt like the part of him that made him who he was, was slowly breaking away. 

""You're a right piece of work,"" he said to his wife, angrily. Bob gazed at Martin, ""and you."" 

Martin glanced away, ""Bob, it's a necessary-"" 

""Don't tell me about necessary. None of you would be on this boat if it wasn't for me picking your sorry asses up."" 

Blaring the throttle, Bob turned the boat around heading straight back the way they'd come. ""What are you doing?"" Marian yelled. 

The stragglers were in their line of vision again, nearly submerged. Bob pulled up not to far away. Shaking his head he reached for the life saving ring and turned to the passengers. ""Get up and help, or the next lot will be taking your place in my boat."" 

Shocked, the passengers stood up moving about. 

*i'll be damned if I let the sea take anyone that I can save,* Bob thought. Warmth spread into him, and he couldn't help but smile as the little girl hugged him when he helped her on board. 

He grabbed an old black spray can from the boat cupboard and hopped up onto the hull. Bob sprayed a line through the words *Sea Rat* above the deck, and with a smirk he wrote: Survivors.

[WP] The Wolf of Wall Street - Title taken literally,Kiwizoom,"He had dreamt of this moment for so long. He used to replay it in his mind over and over. But, actually being there was nothing like he imagined. John Snow was finally old enough to be a guard at the Trump wall. He had fantasized about killing all the rapists and drug addicts on the other side. He was given a small room to stay in the street by that wall, known as Wall Street. 

No way, he was going to come to this place without his wolf ""Ghost"". That furry creature was as lonely as him. The wolf himself was really happy to be at the Wall Street. John Snow was glad that Ghost likes his new surroundings. 

But soon this dream turned into a full blown nightmare. Within a week of coming there, John Snow had his first chance to kill a drug smuggler. He ordered Ghost to pick up the stash. That was the first time Ghost had been this close to Cocaine. He snorted by mistake while he was trying to smell it. 

Ghost was never the same. Soon he became addict and he developed contacts with smugglers from the other side. He kept John Snow in dark about the scale of his operations. But everyone else knew what Ghost had become. Not a single ounce was smuggled without Ghost's permission. Soon, he recruited many other smugglers and guards to create his own cartel. He named it "" Wolf of Wall Street"".",Livery614
[WP] A spaceship crew is trapped on a ship with the most dangerous creature in the galaxy: the Human.,Mofofett,"""The Tzerkz empire will pay a huge bounty for that human!""

""I don't know.  One of the humans responsible for that big hyperspace breach that sucked all those Tzerkz warships in...  Are you sure it's safe keeping him here?""

""Relax!  He's in a metal lockdown brigg.  That thing can keep Hurlars in!""

""Sure.  Speaking of which...  Trzzi, go down there and sure he's fed!""

Trzzi gritted her jagged, sharp teeth.  She had been enjoying her break until the captain summoned her.  The captain and first mate had been fantasizing about what they were going to do with the reward for turning over the human for the past hour or so.  It made enjoying her break hard.

""Anytime like the present, Trzzi!""

Trzzi's ears flipped back and her golden eyes narrowed, ""FINE!  I'll go feed the smelly thing!  I can't see how you two can tolerate the stench!""

Trzzi stomped up from her berth and went straight to the ration store.  She looked around and finally found a suitable ration bar, the one that had been in the back and was the oldest around.  She had been taking exceptional pride in finding the worse rations in the ship to give to the human the last few days.  It was her way of paying back the kick to her backside the human had given her in an attempt to escape capture.  A twitch in eye and a grimace signals the recent memory of the kick... right into a pile of morg dung.  With claws dug into the wrapper of the ration bar, she marches off to the brigg cell in the hold.

---

Trzzi checks the monitor on the side of the door before going in, ""Here's your food human!""

Trzzi kicks the door of the cell open with her bolter drawn.  The cell was a simple metal box with an air vent in the ceiling, waste bucket in the corner, and a simple platform serving as the bed.  She saw the human on the bed, resting comfortably, wrapped up with his precious blanket and pillow.  The Captain must of been in a really good mood to have not only listened, but actually complied with the human's demands.  ""HEY!  HUMAN!  FOOD!""

Trzzi angerly pitches the ration bar right towards the human's head.  The ration bar makes a direct hit, but oddly...  No reaction from the human.  Trzzi puzzles at this for a moment before, walking cautiously up to the bed.  ""STENCH BEAST!""

Nothing still.  Trzzi is right above, next to the bed the human is on.  She aims her bolter right at his head and reluntantly grabs the blanket.  ""HUMAN!  You WILL answer me when-""

Before Trzzi is a collection of clothes, rolled to create the rough outline of a human figure on the bed.  Her nose aches with the human stench.  He's still here, but where-   The thought is cut short as a pair of hands comes out from under the bed and grabs hold of Trzzi's ankles.  A quick, hard pull and Trzzi loses balance and crashes onto the metal floor, her bolter bounces from her hand as the hard impact hits her arm.  Before she's able to get some sense of her situation a figure erupts from under the bed, grabs the blanket with a quick swipe, spins to open up the blanket, and dives on top of her.  A quick bout of wrestling and Trzzi is held from behind by a figure on the ground.  It's a deadlock and neither able to really gain any kind of control over the other.  Trzzi can tell... It's the human...  The smelly, stinky human.

""WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!""

""Escaping.""

""Well, that's not going to work out well!  I'm not going to let you win this fight!  I'm just as strong as you and far more skilled!  And I'll claw you the second you let me go.""

""Yup.""

It's this moment Trzzi realizes the blanket is wrapped around the both of them, coccooning them both.  ""What the fuck are you planning human!""

""My colleague Hans.  She mentioned Wrettas before and how sensitive their sense of smell was.""

""So?!""

""Well, let's see...  I'm recovering from a hangover induced from stun blasts and alcohol, I haven't showered in days, and I've been feed the worst ration bars you got for a few of those days.  Speaking of which-""

The human releases a monserous belch that echoed throughout the cell.

""GODS DAMN YOU HUMAN!  That's disgusting!""

""Exactly...  Right now...  It's just you and me, wrapped inside this lovely high thread count blanket... with all my smells growing stronger by the second.  And judging by the few spasms I felt, you are about to overload that part of your brain dedicated to processing them all.""

Trzzi pupils narrow.  The fucking, smelly human was right.  Wretta have one weakness and that's too many strong, concentrated smells at time.  And for Trzzi it was getting harder to see straight with her eyes watering and she could feel muscle spasms as her mind races uncontrollably.  She needs to get out now and to fresher air!

""And before you try to escape...""

Trzzi pauses, expecting something the human thought clever to say.  She hears something... a long abrupt rumbling, vibrating upon the metal floor, and - OH HOLY GODS, FUCK, SHIT, THAT SMELL!?!?!

The blanket explodes to life as the two struggle underneath.  Hisses, growls, and coughs ring out in the room as the blanket somehow tumbles from one corner to next.  A few seconds later, the blanket stops moving.  After a minute, the blanket unravels and a human male rolls out.  Dressed in nothing but his boxer shorts and socks.  He pulls himself up to sit on the floor, gathers his senses, and wraps the unconscious Trzzi back in the blanket.  He picks her up and carefully places her on the bed, positions her to look similarly to the dummy he made before.  A quick dressing of clothing from the piles he used before and a bolter aquisition later, the human exits the cell, gently closing the door behind him.  ""Nighty nighty, consider the headache when you wake up payment for the fine room service.""

---

""Dammit.  What's taking Trzzi so long?  She better not be roughing up the human!""

""Nah, she wouldn't touch him!  Probably shoot him....""

""...""

""...""

""We might want to check.""

Two big bulky creatures sqeeuze their way out of the bulkhead door from the cockpit of the vessel.  Thick, scaly gray skin covering their bodies and a horns on their massive heads.  They both did not so much as walk as alternate side step towards a forward direction, rocking their upper bodies in rhythm.  It was a few minutes before they reached the cell.

""Huh...  Looks like the human is still in there.""

""Let's ask and see if Trzzi's pestered him.""

""Plus make sure Trzzi didn't shoot him or worse.""

After unlocked the cell, both squeeze in with their massive heavy pistols drawn.

""Human!  Has Trzzi been here?""

""Yah, has the Wretta bothered you yet?""

Nothing.

The first mate carefully approaches the figure on the bed, the captain raises his pistol ready to react.  A quick yank of the blanket.

""Trzzi?!""

""Whoa, that's a foul smell!""

""Shit, her nose got the best of her, get her out the cell!""

The first mate grabs Trzzi and carries her out with the captain leading, his pistol pointing cautiously about.  After a few moments, Trzzi briefly twitches and soon after startles back to life.  ""OH GODS!  My HEAD!""

""What the hell, Trzzi?!""

""Yah!""

Trzzi's eyes narrow and teeth bear, ""Fuck you two!  You knew how dangerous the human was....   Where is the human?!""

The three look around the hold of the ship, searching in vain to see a sign of where the human is...  ""Yah, where is that damn human at!""

The voice over the ship's intercom catches the attention of the trio.

""Ha!  You didn't know the ship had one of these, huh?  Probably because you guys stole it!  HA!  You did!  There's no way any of you has a Tramarian clan name.""

""He must be in the cockpit, let's go!""

""Nope.""

As the captain angerly rushes towards the walkway to the cockpit bulkhead, he ceases forward movement and momentarily runs in place.  He stops running in place as momentum causes him to pitch and rotate in place.

Trzzi backs away from the captain and first mate, looking nervous, ""Captain...  What the hell is going on!?""

Trzzi ceases to have contact on the floor and reflexively tries to grab onto anything but only throws herself for a loop, before slowly being halted and righted by some myserious force.  ""What is going on?!""

""That's a great question!  And I'm happy to answer, young lady!  You see Tramarian trade ships have this really neat gravity control system with a built-in tractor control option.  So... I can do stuff like this!""

The first mate floats off the floor and stops roughly a meter off the ground.  As he ascends he starts spinning.  Faster and faster.  Until about 33 RPM and centrifical forces puts him sideways in the air as he spins.

""You spin me right round baby...""

""GODDAMN YOU CAPTAIN!""

""SHADDAP!  I SHOULD HAVE NEVER MADE YOU FIRST MATE!""

Both figures stop, ""Hey!  That's not nice!  The captain and first mate should be buddies!  Now, say you're sorry, and kiss and make up!""

The captain and first mate slam into each other with a loud thump.

""Oops, shit.  Sorry about that.  Tramarians use hexadecimal for some reason.  Oh!  Trzzi!""

Trzzi's face washes with horror at hearing her name on the intercom, ""Y-y-yes?""

""You can chill.  I got my vengence on you for now.  Here, have a medkit.""

From across the hold a solitary general medkit floats across into the anti-grav bubble Trzzi is in.  She cautiously takes in and opens it up, looking for something for her pounding headache.

""Now... For you two!  I'm betting one of you had the idea to abduct me... from my nice hotel right after my low-key birthday party.  I spent a lot of money on that hotel and really wanted to enjoy a nice relaxing weekend. But, someone decided to snatch me right before I get there and shoot me multiple times with the stun setting... ON THE WEAKEST SETTING!    So...  I've got about four hours before my crew comes to pick me up.  What am I going to do to keep myself entertained...  What. Am. I. Going. To. Do....?""

The captain and first mate look to each other, and pitifully hold each other in as the fright finds its way to their eyes.",Lakstoties

[WP] A spaceship crew is trapped on a ship with the most dangerous creature in the galaxy: the Human.,Mofofett,"""Glen? Why is the door locked? What are you doing?""  
Captain Steven McIntosh and SK-013, the synthetic android who now called himself Matthew, stared at the monitor screen in the airlock. The repairs to the outer hull had been completed, but as the airlock had pressurized, the inner airlock had remained closed.  

""Sorry, Captain"" Glenn called out, his voice dripping with sarcasm. ""But as I said before, it's not safe with those THINGS on board. So, I have decided to take care of the problem. Personally.""  

Bypassing several safety measures and disabling the Master Alarm, Glenn flicked activated the outer airlock door. With a loud bang, the door swung open by the rush of outgoing air, slamming into hull before having the hinges break and began to float away. Matthew, thrown towards the emptiness of space, made a desperate grasp for the edge of the airlock, and found a handhold. As he saw Captain McIntosh fly by, he reached out and grabbed his suit, but the force of doing so made him lose his grip, and both tumbled away from the ship.  

Carla watched this all occur on her monitor, which had been streaming from the captains helmet cam. ""Glenn! No!"" She pushed her way towards the door leading out of the compartment, and attempted to slide the door open. However, the indicator above the door flashed red, meaning that the door had closed to either a pressure breach or something else. With no other ways out, she returned to her screen to monitor the status of the ship, all while hearing the sounds of the two adrift.  
""That son of a bitch!""  
""Captain, what is the status of your suit's maneuvering fuel?""  
""Not enough to get back to the ship, that's for sure.""  
""Please stabilize us. Don't worry. I have a plan.""  
 
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;


Glenn sat back, and watched the exterior footage of the two drifting away. He knew that both of them would suffer a horrible fate, but he didn't feel any remorse. It's his fault, Glenn thought. The captain didn't see how dangerous self-aware synthetics are. And now, he's dead.  

Switching screens, he checked on the status of the room that had been breached by the airlock door. He had put the ship on lockdown by fooling it to think that there had been a breach in the ship, but now that there was one, he had to figure out how major the damage was. But now that the problems were out of the way, he had all the time in the world. A small sound behind him caused him to look behind him, and a surprise impact sent him hurling towards the outer wall.  

After catching himself on the far wall, Glenn looked up and was surprised by the face of SK-0014. ""What are you doing here, you monster?!"" Glenn roared. ""I thought I had you locked you in the maintenance room!""  

""I thought you looked suspicious."" SK-0014 replied, a long metal wrench in his hand pointed towards Glenn. ""To think that in your hatred for us, you would kill a fellow human? You have gone too far.""  

""Too far?"" Glenn let out a hideous, twisted laugh. ""To protect humanity from you monsters, I will go as far as it takes! I will destroy you, robot!""  

""My name, is Nandar!"" Both of them, roiled in fear and hatred, leapt towards each other.  

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

""Don't worry captain. I have a plan.""  

Looking down towards Matthew, who's arm gripped tightly around the leg of his suit, Captain McIntosh tried to assess the emotion on the synthetics face. It was hard to tell, with his fake skin worn down with years of wear and tear of fixing this vessel in space. His instinct and years of training in the military told him that synthetics that had become self-aware could not be trusted, and had to be destroyed. Yet, right now, his human instincts hold him to trust Matthew.  

""Okay. Using remain propellent to self-right.""

Using the ship as a reference point, the suit began to slow the tumble of the two drifters. As they slowed down, Matthew pulled himself up behind the captain. Soon, they had regained a stationary position, but were still drifting further and further away from the safety of the ship.  

""Okay. If you got a plan Matthew, now would be the time.""  

""I apologize for this, Steven.""  

Realizing what Matthew intended at the last moment, McIntosh called out to him, ""No, don't!"" But the hard shove on the back of his suit sent him spinning back in the opposite direction. The hard push put McIntosh into a slight tumble, but he managed to correct himself with the use of whatever remaining maneuvering fuel he had left. As he came closer to the ship, he saw he was floating directly towards the airlock. Drifting through the door, he reached out and caught the cargo netting that they used for this sort of situation. Once he had stopped himself, he turned around and looked out towards the great vastness.  

The was no sign of Matthew.  

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

""This is Captain McIntosh, come in, anyone.""  

Carla's heart raced at the voice coming through her headset. ""This is Carla. The airlock, and the room next to it are breached. There's no coming through this door, but if you can make it through to the other side, you can come in the far door.""  

""I got it. I have 20 minutes of air left, so once I charge my suit, and crawl over there."" There was a long pause through the headset, as both of them waited to hear from the same person. ""... Glenn?""  

A ragged gasp came through. ""This is Nandar. Glenn has been... taken care of."" Another long pause. ""Don't worry. I don't think he's dead, but he's in bad shape.""  

Carla flipped through the monitors until she got to Glenn's quatres. He looked bad, with a large cut on his temple, blood pooling around his ear. However, Nandar looked much worse. He had several large scratches and cuts along his skin. His left arm was bent, with shards of metal and wire sticking out.  

""We better patch him up then. He has a lot to answer for today.""  

""Matthew. Where's Matthew?""  

Even through the monitor, Carla could see the look of fear on Nandars face. He knew that something had happened. ""Nandar... Matthew, he...""  

""He saved my life, that's what he did. He pushed me towards the airlock. I'm... sorry""  

""What? No... NO! You're lying! Matthew, can you hear me?!""  

""I'm so sorry.""  

""You can still get him, right? He's just out there, we can go out and save him, I can go out and get him, I just need a suit, I JUST NEED TIME.""

""Nandar... We didn't see where he went after he pushed off, and he pushed off hard, he could be anywhere... and if we do find him he'll be too far away.""  

""No. NO! Matthew! Please, please come in, I beg of you! Say something, anything!""  

""The wireless communicator has a range of 500 meters, if he hasn't responded he has passed beyond that. This is Captain McIntosh, I am beginning the walk to the opposite airlock.""  

Carla put her headset down. It had merely been 37 days since she had been awoken from cryosleep to deal with the problems with the ship. 37 days since the synthetics on board had awoken from their month long update and had become sentient. 37 days since they had lost all contact with Earth. But, we must keep going, she thought. We must continue our mission until we enter an orbital position around Mars, and deploy the first, and only, Surface to Orbit Capsule. The crew of the Ares, 10 humans stranded in a colony populated with self aware synthetics, depend on us giving them the only lifeline back to their ship, and to Earth itself.

[WP] A spaceship crew is trapped on a ship with the most dangerous creature in the galaxy: the Human.,Mofofett,"“Eww!” Bertha screeched, glaring at Ren “If you insist on touching it, the least you could do is use a stick.”

“But it’s so squishy… c’mon you try; it’s really addicting playing with its weak flesh.” Ren replied as he probed the man’s fatty midsection.  

“No thank you. This is a human, remember that.  At any moment it could wake up and bite off your finger.”

“Are you sure? I really don’t think we have the right creature here. Is the human really the strongest creature on earth? I mean did you see the lions? They were all like ‘Roar!’ with their teeth and claws. It was so bad-ass! We definitely should have taken one of them. Also, why didn’t you let me take a sloth? Just as a pet, nobody would have known!

Bertha rubbed her temples. “Because, Ren, you are a complete idiot and it would have died almost immediately after you took responsibility for it. I honestly have no idea how you became a scientist at all, when you constantly act like a five year old—“ Bertha and Ren suddenly jerked back and moved towards the wall.

The creature had moved.

Ren took out a remote and pressed a button securing the foul creature in a cage of Plexiglas. The man stood up and pounded on the glass for a while before conceding defeat and taking a seat on the cold floor of the ship. 

Bertha began putting on the translation helmet but Ren snatched it out of her hands. 

“Don’t worry, I’ll talk to it” he said. Before Bertha could protest, Ren had initiated conversation. 

“Hello there” Ren said, “Can you understand me, human?” 

“Y-Yes” the man replied, still disoriented by his strange new surroundings.
 
“Good. I just want to let you know, you’re going to be fine. We are taking you back to our home planet where you will compete in a little game show called Intergalactic Death Battle Royale! And as long as you win, you won’t die! Isn’t that awesome! Also your entire family is dead now.”

The man became visibly shaken and sat back down, beginning to sob. 

Ren took off the helmet and chuckled his way back over to Bertha. “Oh my Glarsh he is crying! What a little bitch! Haha.” 

Bertha was not amused. “What did you say to him? Why is he crying? You know that he is supposed to think he will survive, right? We can't have sad contestants on the show.”

“Yeah he knows we aren’t going to kill him but…I maybe might have implied that we murdered his family.” Ren said.

“But we didn’t murder his family.”

“I know! That’s what makes it so funny” 

“You remember when I said you were a complete idiot? Well I just want to apologize for not emphasizing that enough, Ren.”

[WP] A spaceship crew is trapped on a ship with the most dangerous creature in the galaxy: the Human.,Mofofett,"Gryppa, the security officer, sat in his office looking grimly over the footage of the human getting out of his cell. Somehow the human had opened a panel in the wall with his plate and spoon, and had with trial and error matched the different wires to get the door open. He began sweating as backflashes of how The Humen had been a plague to the universe. Their brutality and high interlect made them into a dangerous specie. The four nations had united and nuked the human race out of extinction, but some how it has been decided that the last remaining humans were an endanged specie.

""Sir, we should gather a squat to deal with this humen"" a nervous voice addressed Gruppy. He looked up from the screen and saw Hulo tipping back and forth on his four feets. His two arms where fiddle around with his blue hair on his body. Surely, Hulo had seen the human easy bashing Jailer Cranko into pieces. Breaking all legs and lifted his poor little body up in the air and smashed it into the wall. ""Call for an emergancy and gear up"" Gruppy said as he stood up. 

Five minutes later, the squat was ready to move out. He had not signed up for this, too old for this kind of Goo. He looked over his squat. Hulo was still tripping. Banko had just got of his sleep and his blue hair was just one big mess. Sweet, young and innocent Calio stood there with her full gear and weapon in perfection.

""Ready for your orders, sir"" Hulo squaked out. 
""The human is lose. You know the drill, cover each corner and shoot on first sight. This is no training"" he said, wished he had sounded more tough.
""Cant we talk to the human"" optimistic Calio asked.
Banko rolled his eyes while saying: ""Sure, the fleshmeat is going to sit down and have whitetea with you"".
Calio's fur turned purple and he knew he had to stop this debate. He cut her off before she could speak: ""No time, we need to..."" and a voice came out of the speakers.

""Is there more Furballs around here? I have always wanted to try to make a fieldgoal"". The speakers died out and soon after the light also. The emergency light went on, casting a red light over everything in the security room. Gruppy marched through the door with the words trailing behind him: ""He we go, shoot to kill""",Ehlers

CAPTAIN'S LOG [*Temporal information missing or corrupted*]

Today we visited the third satellite of [*Sol*]. It's rather large for a terrestrial world, but it has just the right conditions for liquid water at the surface. Since liquid water is categorized as a high-speed, low-level working fluid for natural lifeforms, we believed [*Sol*] 3 would serve as an ideal environment for the development of macroscopic life.

We were completely correct; the high oxygen content in its atmosphere is maintained, not by long-term volcanism, but by carbon-sequestering photosynthesizers, which expel diatomic oxygen as waste. Conveniently, we found the native terrestrial heterotrophs could easily survive the ambient conditions of our ship.

Surveying the motile lifeforms, we found the most intelligent tool-users to be: submarine invertebrates with eight independent appendages; flying tetrapods with hard, gasping structures on the front of its head; and walking tetrapods with two appendages dedicated to locomotion and two dedicated to the grasping and manipulation of objects.

The submarine invertebrate would require untenable amounts of liquid water to be taken aboard for long-term habitation, and the flying tetrapods proved too difficult to capture, even when they became inactive as the rotating planet brought them into its shadow. However, we were able to find and capture an inactive specimen of the most advanced tool-user from one of the structures where they spend their inactive period.

After failing to capture a flying tetrapod, the crew complained about the high gravity, and one nearly lost cohesion, so we returned to the ship and fitted everyone with mechanical-assistance units before setting out to capture an inactive biped. I hope the high gravity of its homeworld will not cause the specimen's internal structures to degrade under standard gravity.

After failing to lift the biped with any number of electromagnetic capture systems, we realized the dipolar nature of its working fluid made it resistant to magnetic kinesis. We were forced to lift it bodily (with decontamination suits, of course) and carry it into the containment cell. The lead technician assures me that the electromagnetic restraints will still be sufficient to contain the biped, though I am not so sure.

Transcript of video surveillance from containment cell 3347:

0:00 - Human lies on the floor, expressing the aforementioned inactivity behavior. Most of its surface is covered in artificial layers, presumably to regulate temperatures under unfavorably cold conditions. Layers are patterned with wide [*blue*] stripes, presumably for decorative reasons.

0:14 - Human starts to become active, moving slightly and rising to a position where it can observe its surroundings.

0:17 - Human rises to its full height and looks directly at camera. Human moves its head left and right while maintaining its gaze. The reason for this behavior is unknown; since Human vision is naturally binocular, adjustment of head angle is not necessary to create a volumetric image.

0:20 - Human moves directly through electromagnetic containment barrier with no difficulty or even acknowledgement of its existence. Alerts are immediately sounded. Human immediately looks back at camera, then moves toward camera with alarming rapidity.

0:22 - Human extends appendage toward camera. Video surveillance ends abruptly.

---
CAPTAIN'S LOG [*Temporal information manually expunged*]

I was right. The biped's working fluid made it immune to our containment fields. As soon as it became active, it moved straight through the barrier as though it wasn't there. Then it destroyed the observing pod. We haven't even had a chance to test its intelligence and already it's outwitted us at the first turn.

We had hoped it would stay inactive long enough for us to implant a tracking chip, but now we have no idea where it's gone. We weren't prepared to deal with a hostile lifeform aboard the ship, especially when we can't track its movement.

I'm probably overreacting. It could just be curious; maybe all we need to do is create a makeshift containment cell with physical barriers and satisfy its curiosity. We observed comparable behavior in the brachiating endotherms that we believe to share a common ancestor with the biped.

CAPTAIN'S LOG [*Temporal information completely omitted*]

I was wrong. I was so, so wrong. It's not just hostile, it's actively sabotaging our ship's systems. This has quickly gotten completely out of control. We need to find it and neutralize it. Whatever the difference is in scientific value between a live specimen and a preserved corpse, it can't be greater than the value of all the other live specimens we're carrying.

The thing is, people then to take things at face value. 

Necromancers can control the dead. 

Pyromancers and control fire. 

Aquamancers, water. 

Foodmancers, food. 

But the thing is, everything is edible, isn’t is?

---

Your abilities are granted to you at birth. 

No one truly knows how abilities first came about, although myths and legends have always been around. 

Some people say that abilities were gifts of the gods, some say that the abilities were brought from the devil. 

And in all honesty, most people don’t care where the abilities come from, as long as they have them. 

Of course, having an ability doesn’t mean that one is stuck to that affinity forever. 

An aquamancer might be able to control other types of liquids, but only for a short time and at a weaker level. 

A pyromancer might be able to withstand higher amounts of heat.

A necromancer might be able to control a barely living body. 

A foodmancer would only be able to control food. 

Well, it’s lucky that there’s nothing in the world that cannot be eaten.

---

“You shouldn’t make fun of people like that!”

“What he gonna do to me? Send monster pies to me?”

“He can’t control monsters, remember? Just food.”

“Yeah, maybe he’s going to drown you in milk.”

“Ohh, death by milk drowning. How scary.”

---

Things that fall into the domain of food:

Food.
Meat
Humans (are meat)
Spaghetti 
Meatballs
The flying Spaghetti Monster

---

“How… How are you so strong?”

“...

“Everything in the world can be eaten. For a given value of eaten.”

“Fire isn’t a food source!”

“Fire-eaters extinguish fire.”

“But they don’t eat it!”

“Don’t they?”

---

The thing is, humans have become rigid over the course of time. 

Pyromancers can control fire. 

But fire is more than just ignition and combustion. 

Fire is the the heat and the moment. Fire is to bring to life and to destroy. Fire is passion. Fire is energy. Fire is life. 

And to be a pyromancer is to control that.  

---

“At least you have a thing to control… I only can control things that happened in Cinderella.”

“... Did you read the fairytale?”

“Of course I did, but what can I do? Make pumpkins big?”

“Not the popular one. The original. The variations. The movies.”

“Variations…? But Cinderella doesn’t have variations.”

“They do. Look in museums, old movie relics. Make your own. No one said that it had to be the widely known fairytale. A version of Cinderella I saw before had the sisters mutilate their feet when it didn’t fit into the shoe. You have small feet, don’t you? Why not try mutilating the feet of those with a different shoe size?”

“I… I’ll try. Anything is better than making big pumpkins.”

---

What is food?

Food is anything served for consumption or use.

Food is any nourishing substance that is eaten, drunk, or otherwise taken into the body to sustain life, provide energy, promote growth.

What is to eat?

To eat is to put (food) into the mouth and chew and swallow it.

What is to eat one's heart out?

Is it a. used to indicate that one thinks someone will feel great jealousy or regret?
Or b. to literally eat one’s heart out of one’s chest cavity?

It’s c. Both. 

---

“How can you control people?! This isn’t anywhere near your ability!”

“I can’t.”

“Don’t bullshit! It’s obvious that you’re controlling her!”

“I only can control food. And human is food, isn’t it?”

Once upon a time, there lived a child. 

The child was borne to a necromancer couple, who were well-known throughout the land. The world that anticipated the birth of their child groaned in disappointment, when the child was found the have the power to control food. 

The child grew up scorned, bullied and isolated, for no fault but the abilities given at birth. 

One day, the lonely, tired and angry child came across the relic of a lost time. The old lady the child came across was one of the last of the powerless generation, a generation reliant on equipment and objects, not abilities. 

The old lady took the child into her lap and showed the child another relic of the time that had past. 

And the child read and read and read. Then the child asked the old lady, why the people of the current era abandoned the this treasure trove of information. 

The old lady and smiled at the children on her lap, and said, “Everything is equal, my child. For humanity to gain power, something had to be lost. Can you promise me something, child?”

The child had agreed, for the old lady was the only kind one the child had met for a long time. 

“Destroy this world, for humankind should never have advanced to have these abilities. One step forward and two steps back.”

The child had blinked in shock, for the power to control food did not have the capability to destroy the world. 

“You have to remember, my child,” the old lady said, a sweet smile on her face, “everything in this world is edible. The only difference is whether you die or not. Please, destroy this world for me?”

And the child did.

It's probably a dream. Or my mind is playing tricks on me. There must be something about zero-gravity that fumbles with the brain. 


""No, you're awake,"" returned the small, chirping voice to my inner dialogue, ""and you didn't see that! Understood?""


""Understand? No, I don't think I understand,"" I responded sleepily, amused and still believing this experience to be more fiction than fact.


The voice came again, this time with assurance. ""You didn't see that.""


I obliged. ""I didn't see that.""


But I did see that. And ""that"" was a blonde trundling mass of meteor, or moon, some cratered free-floating space debris that was clearly visible with my two awake and deservedly bewildered eyes from the control room of the ISS. The blonde mass was sifting through the vacant space between me and Earth and, to my surprise, diminishing in size. 


And, as I examined more closely, I saw what appeared to be a frenzy of small, wiry, sable creatures swarming the mass.


""What is that?"" I involuntarily muttered aloud.


""Nothing,"" came the familiar stranger.


""No, that's definitely something,"" I assured. 


Definitely something. I hopped onto the ISS communication system to alert ground control.


""I've got something up here. It's a big hunk of ... It's a thing ... a meteor, a rock, hell if I know. And there's some things moving on it, black infinitesimal objects, hundreds of them. It appears ...""


They were eating it. They were eating the damned blonde mass. They were devouring it piecemeal. A colony of ant-like creatures were having a interstellar picnic on what I can only describe to be a stray, drifting loaf of bread. 


I was stunned. Ground control recommended more sleep. This was not real. 


""You didn't see that! Understood?""


""Do you know any other lines?"" I quipped, shocked, amused, still disbelieving. 


The response was a volley of a song, chanted in unison by a hundred or more of the creatures, each carrying the same small, whiny tone.


""We are the space-ants. Woooooooooooo! We eat space-bread and serve our space-Queen. We rule the ends of the universe and everywhere in between!"" 


Then, in a blinding flash, an unfathomably corpulent, viscous, and unrepentantly repulsive and horrifying queen ant appeared. She had an agape, drooling mouth flanked by two menacing, serrated pincers, and she bore a body that resembled an extra large helping of canned cranberry sauce. She wore rolls of gelatinous skin that melted off her figure and belched a constant spray of pungent slime.


""BEHOLD! I AM TILDA, MAJESTY OF THE SPACE-ANTS. I AND MY LEGION WORKER ANTS HAVE COME TO DEVOUR THE BOUNTY OF WHEAT THAT NESTLES WITHIN THE MOST DESIRABLE AND FRUITFUL REACHES OF NORTH DAKOTA, USA, PLANET EARTH.""


This explains everything. The crop circles in the American Midwest. Men in Black I, II, and possibly III.


""Are you asking for directions?""


""Yes,"" the Queen responded sheepishly. ""We were momentarily distracted by a drifting loaf of space-bread and lost our way a bit.""


""Oh, well, no problem. Just do a 180 for me. Yep. Just like that. And you see that little blue and green ball? Just go straight a couple thousand miles or so and you should be on course for Planet Earth. 


Last I heard, Tilda and her legion of ants were burned to a fine crisp during an unsuccessful flight through Earth's atmosphere. 


Their ashes most likely fell somewhere over a wheat field in North Dakota.

Graham, the astronaut who had been eating in the ISS' galley are of the middle deck, staring out one of the windows at the strange landmass illuminated by the Sun, plainly stating it's existence to Graham. He secured the meal of Spaghetti Bolognaise he'd been eating in it's container, putting it back in the locker tray where it came from, put his fork away and mentally prepared his response to the radio.

""Graham to ground control, how did you know I saw this...new...landmass? It seems to be of a considerable size, half the size of Antartica"" he looked down at the landmass on Earth again.

The radio stayed silent for a few seconds and Graham really wished his fellow astronauts were awake right now. Instead, they'd chosen to take the last hour to sleep, all five of them. They were all a new crew aboard the ISS, replacing the previous crew just two days ago and the excitement of being on the ISS had made the adjustment difficult and their bodies were finding it hard to cope with the change, leading to sleep deprivation.

""Um...you're a little off course"" the radio cut through the silence, ""The ISS has gone a little off course"".

Graham stared at the radio, bewildered. ""How far off course? And who am I speaking to?""

""Fifty kilometres. That's about 31 miles off course. And you're speaking with Andrew, I've just been added to the ground control team"" Andrew sounded like someone who was trying his best to seem like he was telling the truth, but failing.

Graham sucked in some air and stared at the landmass. Shaped like a circle with irregular edges, it was covered in lush looking green grass and tall, impressive looking trees which had bulbous looking treetops, swaying in the wind which meant that the grass must be extremely long or the wind was blowing in gale force winds. It was hard to tell from the ISS. And right in the centre of the landmass was what looked like a tiny settlement, with a giant, rectangular shaped arch in the middle of this settlement. The arch seemed to be of a monolithic size as the shadows it cast went on for a long distance.

A few things stood out to Graham in his mind as he stared at this landmass. First was the fact that the ISS had drifted 31 miles off course, which prompted him to snap out of staring at the landmass and check the computer tracking the ISS' orbit. Sure enough, the ISS had drifted 31 miles off course. The second thing that stood out to Graham was Andrew. It seemed suspicious that Andrew had been added to the ground control radio communication team and the way he told Graham to pretend he didn't see the strange landmass. Lastly, if no one else knew about the strange landmass except for some governments who most likely did, why had no one told the current ISS crew about it? They were bound to see it sometime. And the landmass was big enough to be considered a continent.

""Okay...Andrew. I'm just going to go back to eating my lunch and uh...working...doing the stuff I do up here. I won't say a word about the strange landmass, but you could help me by telling me why we're off course"" Graham radioed ground control and at that moment, one of the ISS crew decided to come in to the control room. Dmitri, one of the Russian members of the crew.

""I don't know how the ISS got off course but I'll ask my supervisor what to do, which probably means asking someone else in another department to come in and help"" Andrew's voice warbled through the radio and Graham looked at Dmitri, raising an eyebrow.

""What is going on?"" Dmitiri wandered over to the computer that tracked the ISS' orbit. ""We are off course?""

Graham nodded grimly and stared at the landmass again. The rectangular arch in the middle of the settlement was obviously used for something. He studied the surrounding area near the landmass. It appeared the ISS' was orbiting above the South Pacific. The corner's of Australia could be seen and New Zealand's towns and three main cities could all be clearly seen, and the Fijian, New Caledonian, Samoan, French Polynesia, and Cook Island's could all be seen as well. The vivid white of Antarctica was barely visible. The landmass seemed to be closest to Anarctica, a small channel of sea between the two.

Dmitri floated over to the window Graham was staring out of. He swore in Russian, eyes wide. ""What is that?""

""A landmass which we've never seen or been told about"" Graham was beginning to get over the shock of seeing the unknown landmass.

""That rectangle arch, it seems important"" Dmitri said and Graham nodded.

""That's what I've been thinking about. Let me try and ask if ground control's come up with any solutions to the problem yet"" Graham moved himself back to the radio and tried to get a reply to no avail.

""They're not replying"" he said after 45 minutes of trying.

Dmitri shook his head. ""What if the small village on the land isn't populated by us?""

Graham looked at Dmitri, puzzled.

""Us. Humans"" Dmitri said and Graham's expression changed to one of amusement.

""I don't believe that. It could just be a secret base for some Government. Most likely mine"" he sighed.

""Then how do you explain the satellites attached to the arch? What human technology could pull in so many satellites without them burning up in the atmosphere first?"" Dmitri pointed at the window.

This time it was Graham's turn to widen his eyes. ""And the fact that the ISS has moved closer to Earth. We're not only off course, but being pulled towards Earth"" he whispered.

Suddenly the ISS lurched towards Earth. Graham didn't need to say it to know where it was headed.

""That arch is a fucking magnet. And it's pulling us down"" Graham jerked his head to Dmitri, only just realizing this fact.

The effects of gravity kicked in a few seconds later and they were both slammed into the floor of the ISS, against the windows they had been looking through. Alarms went off all around them, yet they couldn't do anything as they were pinned down by gravity.

And the ISS hurtled towards Atlantis, the citizens staring at the giant metal craft in awe and anticipation of what they might discover. They hadn't seen the world for so long and were just discovering how much had changed. One of the most remarkable of which was the ability of humanity to put metal stars up in the sky.",Gxex

You're right, commas are weird. I used to have a terrible problem with comma splicing and run-on sentences. Perhaps this is the result of my over correcting? I'll look into it and make sure I have a better grasp of it from here out.

You have been incredibly helpful tonight! Thank you again! ",RidleyXJ
"[CC] Trying to get back into writing, took a prompt from a friend to write a description of myself in 2nd person. I'm really rusty at this point. Any feedback would be appreciated.",RidleyXJ,"Thank you so much for the critique! It means a lot to me. 

It's a relief to hear that the punctuation errors were minor. If it wouldn't be too much to ask, could you point out the 'commas for parenthetical elements' you mentioned? The fact that I'm not sure what you're pointing out troubles me, because I should know this. I'm determined to learn from my mistakes!

As for the detective-like nature of my narrator, I'll agree with you, he's a little too informed. I have no doubts that my being a huge fan of the BBC Sherlock series and my fiancé's running Criminal Minds marathon have influenced my writing. I'll go back over it and see if I can make the conclusions seem more natural or work them into something else. 

Again, thanks so much for reading, and for the advice! You weren't harsh at all. I've had someone tear me a new one before, but as long as we can laugh about it when it's over, it's all good. ",RidleyXJ
"[CC] Trying to get back into writing, took a prompt from a friend to write a description of myself in 2nd person. I'm really rusty at this point. Any feedback would be appreciated.",RidleyXJ,"All things said I think it's well written. I get a fairly good idea of the character, and at no point did the writing feel clumsy.

For me, the most effective description was the comparison to a mix of Lebowski and Lennon - that sentence paints some really good broad strokes, and I immediately felt like I could picture the guy in my head. Unfortunately since it comes right at the end, it ended up conflicting with the picture I'd built up over the previous 4 paragraphs and probably did more harm than good.

I'd recommend moving that high-level view to near the beginning. That way, you give the reader an overall impression of the guy and then refine it as you describe the specific details, rather than giving them the details and then an overall impression that may not match.

Similarly, the very last sentence tells us that he's a friend's old acquaintance (at least that's how I understood it). It feels a bit odd for that to just be tagged on like an afterthought. You might want to try putting this information across earlier, which would give us a little extra context for the passage. Maybe see if you can come up with a more natural way to express it, too - you could show it by having him greet the narrator's friend in a way that makes their relationship obvious without outright saying it.

As Pyronar said, some of the descriptions seem a little too informed for an outside observer. They feel more like logical leaps than educated guesses, and I think there's too much assumption about what's going on inside the subject's head.

You have a few very long sentences that would probably be more effective if you pared them down a bit (for example, 'He had a serious face ... chorus of laugh lines'). Other than that, I think the writing flowed fairly well. There are a few areas worth polishing, but it's really not bad at all.",Azual
"[CC] Trying to get back into writing, took a prompt from a friend to write a description of myself in 2nd person. I'm really rusty at this point. Any feedback would be appreciated.",RidleyXJ,"You're welcome. As for commas, again I could be wrong (English punctuation rules can get weird), but these are the ones I've noticed:

&gt; It felt like it wanted to be more, but\*,\* judging by the unevenness of his 5 o'clock shadow\*,\* it seemed genetics were unwilling to cooperate.

&gt; He had the build of someone who had once been athletic\*,\* but hadn't adapted well to a sedentary job;

&gt; His relaxed presence put me at ease\*,\* as I joined in the banter of the evening with my friend's old acquaintance.

You could also make an argument for a comma here, but I'm not sure. It may be optional.

&gt; As he spoke\*,\* he gestured wildly with his hands,

And I don't think this comma should actually be here:

&gt; He had a serious face, though as he greeted a friend\*,\* laughter crinkled

Also this bit bothers me:

&gt; Beneath his hooked nose that spoke of a Native American ancestry, he wore a goatee that spoke similarly of Irish,

I would put ""which"" instead of ""that"" in both cases with commas before them. The reason why is because ""that"" is only used for essential information, but those pieces don't sound essential. You could put both fragments in parentheses or even omit them entirely and the sentence would still make sense. ""Beneath his hooked nose he wore a goatee, it's redness contrasting with the dull tones of his hair."" is a valid sentence and does not omit any essential information. For non-essential fragments you have to use ""which"" and enclose them with commas. Just put them where you would put parentheses and it should make sense.",Pyronar
"[CC] Trying to get back into writing, took a prompt from a friend to write a description of myself in 2nd person. I'm really rusty at this point. Any feedback would be appreciated.",RidleyXJ,"Mostly this is very well done. You characterize the character well, show some good and bad traits, and keep it interesting throughout. There are a few technical mistakes: using ""it's"" instead of its, forgetting about commas for parenthetical elements, but nothing major. What interests me more here are the things the narrator notices and the conclusions he makes. Now prepare for a pretty lengthy explanation, because as anyone who ever received CC from me will tell you I can't really describe why something is good (and this is good) in detail, but I sure as shit can rant about the few nitpicks I do find.

It is fairly obvious that you as the author want to tell these things about a character and that's not that great. Your narrator suddenly turned into almost Sherlock Holmes noticing the slightest details, like the 5 o'clock shadow, how comfortable you are with your build and height. Some of these are OK, but in my opinion there are too many. However, do keep in mind that this depends entirely on your narrator. If he is the type of person who is used to observing and analysing people then you can be this liberal with his observations. However, there is still one thing about this that strikes me as odd.

Assumptions. The narrator has a lot of those. He sees the 5 o'clock shadow and immediately assumes genetics. He sees his build and draws this rather far fetched conclusion:

&gt; had once been athletic but hadn't adapted well to a sedentary job;

Unless he knows about your job or that you always wanted to get a beard these assumptions (and several others) seem way too confident. Even if your narrator is some sort of detective he would still think about different possibilities, wonder to himself whether it's this or that reason, but not really be as sure about the conclusion.

Again, I like this fragment. The problems with it are not major, but still something you might want to look into in the future.

Good luck and welcome back!

[WP] write a story without mentioning any characters only referencing their impact on the world.,Solanoid,"Entrepreneurs, the hidden devils of the consumer based economic systems that we live in, are what drives the human race forward. On the surface we see them as geniuses; people of a higher stature with drive and willpower surpassed only by others of greater nature. Do not give in to this ideology. The world needs you. The slow breathe of Earth is gradually decreasing, a cancer spread on its fragile exterior.


Our choices have been given to us. We did not make them ourselves. The spread of sensitivity has caused us to become prey for those who don’t listen. Those who don’t listen are the ones we listen to.


Why have the rich become richer, and the poor become poorer? The gap in wealth is the impact of such ‘geniuses’. We listen because we do not think for ourselves. Do you not believe the impact of a democracy should be the will of the majority? The paths paved for future presidents are not made by the public, they are made by the few who do not listen; the tycoons with greed in their eyes and the hearty laughs of ruthless apathy. Those who do not listen are the ones we listen to despite how much filth they spit in our faces.


Imagine a life living in a house, with a daughter, a son and a loving mother. Their father works day and night providing a light in a much too dark site. There is a hand, much too large for healthy inhibitions, slowly applying pressure on their god forsaken property. A hard enough pressure, however, to cause considerable damage on a minute scale from day to day. All seems well till the stilts start to crack and the damage has become visible, but not yet severe. Much like dripping water from a tap or on your head. It seems like nothing now, but when rent is due and patience is gone there is nothing you can do. Both mind and matter lost in the ocean of a capitalist wasteland.


Do not lose faith however, for there is still some oxygen left. A fire will burn if you give it enough fuel. Steel decays, wood rots and the world renews. The scum of the world cannot outlive the good, for the human mentality is much like their bodies; built to survive, built to adapt but most of all built to love.

Alright things are going well! I'm almost at the point I died last time, i'll get that twat this time round, almost there, just round here and....what the hell?!!

[IP] Crow Temple,Syraphia,"The Crow King lives in the temple. They say it is sacred, but I was never so sure. 

The temple was old, that I knew, but I wasn't frightened by it. As kids we were told that the ancient practices that take place in there are to maintain the purity of the gods, that there must be sacrifice to achieve equilibrium. 

I didn't want to be sacrificed. 

Each time the Blood Oak festival came around, we had to give one of us up. Normally someone old was chosen, most even voluntarily stepped forth into the forest that would take them to the Crow King. This year, we had few old. For as far as I could remember, our population had declined because of the flea harvest being harsher and harsher. No one's skin was left untouched, and we bore rashes for months just to gain a chance at increasing our already slim crops. The Crow King had said that the flea harvest was necessary for us to make the gods happy. They needed suffering, to make sure that whoever didn't suffer would be punished accordingly, and the itching was supposedly proof of our innocense. 

I never believed it. 

As the Blood Oak festival began, so did the sacrificing - we tried to find things to sacrifice, but most only had a clothing item, an axe, certain things that they were willing to part with that weren't vital to their survival. The years had been plentiful before, but as the crops died, more and more sacrifices were needed. The Crow King ruled with an iron fist and cited the anger of the gods as a reason to torture the declining forest village population. 

When the festival fire had been lit, large, raging and hot, I saw the shadow of the Crow King emerge from the temple. He was tall, wide shouldered and wore the long and pointy mask, covered in feathers as black as the night. His staff had an eye painted on the top, and as he neared the silent crowd, he threw his stick out and screamed with his thin, angry voice. 

He said we had enraged the gods. That we were the fault of the crops dying, we hadn't sacrificed enough nor suffered enough. The flea harvest should have gone on longer, he said, then we would be free of our starvation and our scarred skin. 

He leered maliciously, his yellow teeth clacking together, as he said that he had a solution for us. Now, he knew who it was to blame for the gods hating us, who it was that caused the infection of lies and deceit in the village. 

He pointed his staff toward me. 

Gasps around me were heard, and he said that I was the one to be sacrificed. Once I was dead and my blood had been poured into the Blood Oak, the crops would come back and we would live in happiness again. 

He lied. I knew he lied all along. And I didn't want to be sacrificed. 

He approached me and poked his staff into my chest, saying how I was a maggot and a snake for being a heretic. He struck me hard across the face with his eyed stick, and I fell to the wet and cold ground. He stood over me and said that he would take me into the temple and would make me suffer like I deserved so the gods would appreciate the final sacrifice. That I would scream and bleed like I had never bled to give the gods their drink that I had taken from them. 

My heart beat in my head, and panic, fear and anger rose. As I lay on the ground, he stepped in foot atop my head and asked me if he shouldn't just as well crush my head there and then. A piece away I saw my mother, paralyzed from fear and sorrow, tears streaming down her face as she held onto my little bother's hand. 

The Crow King slid his foot off my head and spat on me. He called me deceptive scum. 

Enough was enough. I slowly rose to my feet before I spoke. I told him it was over. That no more would be sacrificed. 

Behind his mask he sneered. 

I threw my body into him, throwing him to the damp forest floor. he lost his breath and stayed down, and as I quickly stepped up, I cast my foot down upon his neck. The loud crack of the bones shattering had never sounded so satisfying or horrible. 

But now we were free.

[IP] Crow Temple,Syraphia,"Each day went by without sunlight nor a living sound. The mists and dense brush that surrounded the crow temple kept all life out, except for the crows and the Crow Master himself. 

One evening that all changed. A number of crows brought to him a small girl, pale and unconscious. Leaning down the crow man placed a hand on her cheek, hot skin touched against the icy veins of his own. He recoiled, human touch was a feeling he'd lost familiarity with. 

""Bring me my medicine pack,"" Crowman hissed. The black birds flew frantically to the back of be room and his satchel bounced across wooden floorboards toward him.  The old man drew out snapes grass and durrweed, both pain killers to help soothe girls fever. 

It took half a day before she was conscious again. And as he nursed her back to good health, they shared memories of other times and places. She'd been lost in shipwreck and stumbled across his bog. With nowhere else to go, he decided he would help her find her way home. 

Besides, a smelly swamp was no place for a young girl.  

They travelled through forest and brush. Spending nights in darkness, guarded by crows. He taught her about leaves, weeds, plants for eating and medicine.

At first light they stumbled across the same shipwreck the girl had been lost in. Jumping with glee she ran to the shoreline, a British boat lay anchored not far away. Approaching, the small dingy held four people.

""Do you recognise them girl?"" He asked her. 

""Yes Crow Master, they are my family."" 

The boat anchored, and off hopped three gentlemen dressed in fine blue tunics with pistols clipped at their hips. A blonde lady in white dress ran to the girl, wrapping her in an embrace. 

""Victoria! Are you okay my love?"" 

""Yes, I am thank you my queen,"" the girl replied. 

""How did you get back? We were worried sick!"" ""It was this man that helped me, the Crow Master,"" Victoria turned Pointing. 

Crow master bowed, ""It was my pleasure my lady."" 

""What did you do to her?"" The queen hissed. ""I'm sorry, wha-"" the crow master began. 

""Arrest him! He kidnapped young Victoria."" 

Victoria screamed as they grabbed him, his frail bones buckling under the strength of the younger men, iron calsps clicked tightly on either of the Crowmasters hands. 

""P-please I have done nothing wrong,"" the old man pleaded. 

""Victoria darling, I would like to ask you three questions, and you must answer truthfully."" 

Victoria glanced at the Crowman and then the Queen, nodding. 

""When you woke, were where you?"" ""At the Crowmasters cabin."" 
Nodding, the Queen continued, ""Did he force you to take medicine you had not asked for?"" ""Only to help-"" The queen gave a dangerous glare. ""Y-yes."" The Queen folded her arms, "" And did he force you to stay with him?"" ""Y. . . Yes."" 

The crack of a gun exploded on the beach. 

Victoria screamed, the Queen's hand covered her eyes. 

Beneath her feet she could see the red blood mixing with sand. Squawking sounded madly from the trees around, Victoria's presence the only thing stopping the crows. 

""B-but he helped me!"" She wailed. The men just shook their heads, walking back to the boat, ""poor kid."" The one with the gun muttered. 

""You'll understand when you are older my dear girl,"" the Queen said.

Inching back to the boat Victoria let her tears flow freely. She felt empty and cheated, her words misunderstood. 

""I will always protect you my girl,"" The queen said, wiping a tear from Victoria's cheek. 

Victoria simply nodded, too shocked to say anything more.

  ""Syntax correct."" The voice was almost hollow in intonation, but the being spoke fluent English.
The overly large, mostly human eyes were motionless. At least they appeared that way most of the time, as the being had no discernible pupil or iris. Dr. McIver met the eyes with his own, and paused for a moment.

""Are you volunteering to be analyzed?"" There was an uneasy undertone to the doctors voice.

""We are."" it responded. An odd choice of words. McIver tilted his head slightly, curious. 

""We? Is there another landing craft?""

""Two landers destroyed on entry. This unit remains."" No emotion at the thought of its comrades burning alive.

""Yes, we are all here. Base-ten reference: Two hundred billion.""

""What? Billions of...You?"" The doctor could sense a faint hint of pride, and his concern was mounting.

""Incorrect. Approximately two hundred billion genetically distinct live probes, sharing cognition."" A bit more pride, but nothing overt. McIver had to push the growing lump back down his throat for his next inquiry.

""Define 'live probe'.""

  ""Live probe: Genetically stable, expendable, artificially birthed exploration unit. Metabolic rate, cognitive function, and brood link have been modified for long distance travel. "" Noticeable pride now. The doctor hastily retrieved his personal notebook from a bag beside his chair.

""Brood link?""

""Cognitive connection to other units, extending to native celestial body. Live probe directives issued in real time from launch site.""

""Ah.""McIver was writing furiously, for fear of leaving out any detail.""What are your directives right now?"" he was visibly nervous, flicking his pen back and forth between his thumb and index finger.

""Disseminate contents of landing craft data banks, transmit relevant biological and meteorological information to brood, terminate mission via voluntary vivisection"". The last directive hung in the air as the two stared at eachother.

""So...You want to die?""

The being responded with just a slight hint of aggression. ""We demand it. This unit contains invaluable data. Humanity must advance. Earth has yet to be noticed.""

""Noticed...By whom?""

""Unknown. Brood has chosen to withhold information for safety. Subsequent live probes carry more information. Next arrival scheduled for human calendar date 'January fourth, two thousand one hundred'"".

""Jesus.""

""Proceed.""

The evening dragged into the early hours of the morning, and I once again found myself at the Night Owl, one of the few pubs in the capital where a prince could enjoy anonymity. I drained the last of my beer, setting my glass down on the stained wooden table with a clank, and looked out the grimy window as dawn started to break over the horizon. The old hag was almost two hours late. I wasn't ready to give up on her yet though. This was important.

I had brought his diary with me. I  flicked my thumb across the edges of the tattered pages feeling the grooved edges against my skin. I had spent almost two hours picking through the ruins of my father's library to collect as many pages as I could. The pages had raised more questions than they had answered.

“Trying to make some money tonight, partner?” a voice from behind me said, as a pack of cards flew above my left shoulder and landed on the table. I was still lost in thought about the diary, so the projectile tossed by my old gambling buddy, Nats, startled me. Instinctively, I slammed the book shut, and swung my head around to face him.

“Not tonight, friend,” I said, not without a hint of remorse. It had been almost a week since I had last sat in on a high stakes game, and the itch of gambling was already returning to me. “I'll be leaving soon.” I rubbed away sleep from eyes, trying anything to keep myself from passing out face down on the hard oak.

Nats swung around and took a seat at my table. “You don't look so good, bud.” He tapped my empty glass. “You need some help getting home tonight?” 

“I haven't had that much. I'll be fine.” A kind offer from Nats, but one that I could never accept. Nats was friendly enough, but he was a profiteer, and information was valuable. He did not know my true identity. If he ever discovered that I lived in the Castle, he could easily deduce that I was a prince, and sell the information to the highest bidder. That would mean no more Night Owl for me.

I quite liked drinking at the old, dusty tavern. I found myself down in its cellar two to three times a week. After my father's death, that number had escalated to four to five. The pub was my escape from politics, etiquette, and royal responsibility. There had once been a time that Zeke would had joined me in sneaking out of the castle for a drink with commoners. Now he was King. I almost felt bad for the poor bastard. You spend too much time among nothing but teachers, advisers, and council members, and you start to go crazy.

Just then, the door to the tavern opened, and an old hunched lady hobbled into the bar. My old hunched lady. First things first, I had to get Nats out of here. “Sorry, Nats, I've got some business with the herbalist.” I gestured at the old lady slowly making her way over to our table.

Nats stood up, grimacing as his steadied himself on his bad leg. “I thought you were off that stuff, bud.” He shrugged. “I'll see you tomorrow then. Out of towners will be around for the funeral of the King, looking to play a few rounds, and lose some money to us. Low hanging fruit, ripe for the picking.” He flashed me a toothy smile as he flourished his deck of cards, before shuffling off to greet another regular across the bar. 

The old hag sat down across from me without introduction.

“Now yours is face, I haven't seen in a long time,” the old hag said, through a mouthful of yellow, broken teeth. “Hard times for you son?”

“No, not at all,” I said, a bit more forcefully than I had intended. “I'm not here for any of your regular stuff. I want the memory herb. You know the one, that gives you....,” I hesitated, “lucid dreams.”

The old lady smiled. “Nostalgic for the past, are we?” She dug a bony hand into satchel, rummaging around for the medicine that I had requested. “And what is it exactly, that a young man wishes to remember?”

I scoffed at her question. “I don't really see how that's any of your business.” I slapped 5 gold down on the table. “I guess it doesn't matter though. It's about an old memory I had about my father, when I was a child.”

The old lady looked at me skeptically. “The herb works best in reliving sensory experiences,” the old lady warned. “Most young men buy it to relive a fun night they had at a brothel. You may find it will have trouble with any memories about conversations, especially ones as distant as your childhood.”

“I don't care,” I retorted. “This is important. I need to try.”

The hag laughed. “Well, I warned you. You pay the gold, you can do as you please.” She slipped me three fine silver leaves, each the size of my pinky finger, from underneath table. “Take them with drink, and allow at least five hours.”

I nodded. “Thank you.” I stood up, my business concluded. It would be a long walk back to the castle. I had hoped that Gwen and Becca would not have noticed my disappearance that night. They both disapproved of my late night escapades, calling it dangerous for royalty such as myself. I called it living. 

I hurried to wrap my travelers cloak around my shoulders, and rushed out of the bar, into the cold night air.

I was almost a block away from the tavern when I realized with a jolt to my stomach that I had left  had left the diary on the table. 

I doubled back, and dashed back to the Night Owl at a full sprint. Breathlessly, I shouldered my way back into the bar, my eyes darting to the back corner where I had sat. The old lady was still sitting at the table alone, looking down into the bottom of a glass of a tall glass of mead.

She must have heard me approaching, because she turned around before I had a chance to speak, holding the diary in her hand. 

“Thought you might come back for your book,” she said ,staring at me with an indiscernible expression. She extended the ragged leather out towards me with a shaking hand.

I snatched it away from her, suspiciously. “Correct. Did you read it?” I was almost afraid to hear her answer.

She chuckled. “These old eyes of mine aren't much for reading any more,” she said sadly. “I would not make for a very good snoop. Curiosity is something that fades over time, much like youth.”

I let out a sigh of relief. “All right then. Thanks for guarding it for me.”

She seemed rather amused by my concern. “I would try not to lose that book again, young man,” she said to me, a mischievous twinkle in her eye. “Not all eyesight is as poor as mine.”

[WP] You died a foolish king. Written in your diary is the greatest sacrifice for your people.,boredcup,"He died and then there were festoons on the avenues. The air between narrow streets was filled with zipping sounds--kazoos and a farrago of cheering. In plazas under the shade of almond trees, women straddled mustached men seated in tilted, woven chairs. Tallow colored men huddled in circles, their skeletal hands strumming guitar strings, their voices accordions, and women in garish colored linen skirts sashayed and giggled into each other, dancing over macadam streets and twirling like weathervanes. Canapés with dollops of braised meats and pickled fish were laid out on serving platters and were gone before the waiters could get two steps out of their kitchens. Sangria was served by the vat, and borrachos that night shared troughs next to heirloom hogs that they put their arms around and dotted with sweet, porcine kisses. The music and the dancing continued through the night, and day brought no break. Light wearied though they were, the revelers stumbled through continuous rounds, the guitarists bleeding over chords, their eyes like eggs poached in red mole. 

Just beyond a narrow moat, in a castle whose bricks were the color of dried wheat, aged men in ministerial coats walked up a helix stair. They stopped and turned to a window, and through the blurred glass they saw people dancing like little flames on match sticks and circling, hands together. “We should be envious that they may celebrate,” one said. 

The ministers continued upwards. They walked into a room whose stones were as cold as buried bones. A widow was leaned over a body on a bed and held with one hand an empty vial and with the other an alabaster palm, limp and tilted from a thick wrist. The ministers spread into a crescent when they entered the room. They were old men who knew only their own intelligence, and loved the sounds of their own voices. That the king should be gone, and at this crucial moment, was cause for surreptitious joy. They stood in front of the widow appearing solemn, but their ash eyes darted silently, nervously, like a line of hens pecking around a serpent. 

A thin man with a trimmed beard broke through their ranks. He had in his hand a rolled parchment with a dried drop of wax pressed into the seam. He did not introduce himself, but that his hands were slender and long and he had amber skin and eyes that were like round ink wells meant he needed no introduction as to name or purpose. He handed the widow the parchment and put his hand on the dead man’s wrist. He made a silent count and left the room, breaking again the ranks of the old men with guts the size of casks. 

The widow read the unrolled parchment and said to an embalmer: “You may prepare his body.” She wept in consternation, but none of the men in the room attempted to console her. One of the men walked to a west facing window. He asked for a monocular and he stood a long while looking through it. The horizon was rippled like steam lines. There he saw flags and columns of steel pikes and cannon and caissons. He redirected the lens and glassed the verdant plain that separated the near stone rampart from the distant battlements. A lone man on horseback galloped across the space, and in time the lines of men in the distance began to disassemble into the silver glimmer of distance. The man capped the lens and turned and nodded. 

Left alone, the bed bearing only the imprint of the body that had laid on it, the widow rose with the parchment in hand. She walked to a drawer and pulled from its contents a leather tome stuffed with papers. She opened it so that she could slip the held parchment into it. There was a line on the final page.  Reading it made her feel intoxicated by an abysmal depression: “I stole your peace so that they might have theirs.” ",1313131313

[WP] One day you were electrocuted by a random generator granting you the power of a random power every day. A few years pass and you have just gained confidence to take out your highschool crush on a couple of dates. These dates span days and your powers are making it difficult.,dsiluiel,"On Thursday, I went to school as normal. I saw Florence, but she didn't see me. As much as the powers may have helped me the last couple of days, invisibility is never good for a relationship. We did manage to talk, and we decided to go see a movie that night.  
As we arrived at the theatre, I decided to meet her inside. After all, I didn't really need a ticket. Thankfully, I wasn't really hungry, so I didn't need any snacks. I met up with her, though she still couldn't see me, and we went inside.  
The movie she had chosen was one of those sappy love stories. I watched, but I didn't really enjoy it. I much prefered what we did together in the dark. There, my power didn't matter. She wouldn't have been able to see me anyways.  
After the movie, I offered to walk her home, and she accepted. We were on the other side of town, as that's where the only Movie Theater in town was, so it was quite a walk through the rough part of town.  
As we walked down Knockendale Drive, Florence had an idea. ""I'm pretty sure this alley is a shortcut. Let's go down it."" It wasn't a very good idea, considering the neighborhood we were in, but I went along with it. I was blinded by love.  
As we walked down the alley, a six foot tall man leapt out and grabbed Florence. ""Hey there, baby. How'd you like to have the night of your life?""  
Florence was obviously in pain, but she also seemed to be too scared to speak, so I spoke for her. ""She's already having it with me."" I said, as confidently as I could.  
The gorilla looked around. ""Who said that? Where are you?""  
I smiled at the situation, though no one else saw it. ""I'm right here."" I said as I punched him in the mouth. He had quite the tough jaw, and I think I hurt my fist more than I hurt him.  
""HA!"" he laughed. ""You call that a punch? They should call you The Breeze, cause I can't see you and you can't do anything useful at all!""  
At that moment, I heard the clock tower ring out. Midnight. I felt my new power before I saw it. I felt stronger, taller, and far less wimpy. I knew I was likely visible at this point, but I decided to give him one more hit. This one he felt.  
""OOOOWWWW!!!"" He ran away, screaming. Unfortunately, as I turned to Florence, she seemed just as scared. I began walking away when she stopped me.  
""Jimmy, I...I...thank you. You saved my life."" I had not expected this. I had just shown her, first hand, that my life was completely unpredictable. No one wanted that kind of a date.  
""Maybe I did, but you would be a lot safer without me.""  
""Are you kidding? You just beat up the biggest thug in town! I don't see anywhere that could be safer!""  
I frowned. ""Aren't you worried about how unpredictable my life is? I don't even know what tomorrow will bring in terms of powers. It's impossible to plan around!""  
She stepped up to me and gave me a kiss. ""Not impossible. Just more difficult. Besides, a little unpredictability can be a good thing.  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  
On Saturday, at exactly 9:36 and 27 seconds, Florence and I met up for coffee again. I had found that I was exhibiting a superior intellect, as well as an acute sense of precision and attention to detail. I noticed the pattern on Florence's dress, as well as the spots where it had been broken by a careless tailor making it fit. I noticed the minute differences between her eyelashes, suggesting a fair amount of thought went into preparing her makeup. I noticed everything. And I loved every detail.",gemohandy

[WP] One day you were electrocuted by a random generator granting you the power of a random power every day. A few years pass and you have just gained confidence to take out your highschool crush on a couple of dates. These dates span days and your powers are making it difficult.,dsiluiel,"On the first date, I knew I needed to make a good impression. This was my high school crush; the girl of my dreams; my soulmate, potentially. I could not mess this up. I left that to my powers.  
Our first date was fairly simple; we went out to grab some coffee and just talk. Of course, I knew that would be all, but that didn't stop me from wanting more. As I woke up, I hoped that the day's power would be extreme pheromones, or some other form of love control. I ran through my daily tests. None of the big common ones (it rarely ever was), nor something obvious to control. I gave up on it, and got dressed for the big date.  
As I walked out of the living room, I passed my brother, Kevin. *Oh great, it's Jimmy. Don't let on that you broke his XBox - just play it cool*.  
""YOU BROKE MY XBOX?"" I yelled, or at least I tried to. It came out more like ~~""yu pok i ekpok?""~~ Clearly, my power was preventing me from being able to speak clearly. That would not help on the date.  
I went out, and arrived at the café. She wasn't there yet, so I decided to try practicing my power. It seemed to be telepathy, of some sort. I went up to the counter and looked straight at the girl there.  
""Hi there! Welcome to Java the Hut! May I take your order?"" *This guy is really creeping me out. I hope he just gives me his order and leaves.*  
I was a bit offended at that, and tried thinking over my response. *I'm not that creepy. I just have unnatural superpowers that I have little to no control over, and that frequently get me into trouble. Also, I'm focusing intensely on you to try getting the hang of the-okay, yeah it's a little creepy.*  
Before I could say anything, she responded. ""Glad to hear you agree. Sorry about the power thing. Now, may I take your order?"" I seemed to be getting the hang of my telepathy, so I ordered and sat down.  
About five minutes later, She walked in. The most beautiful girl in the entire school, Florence LeBoum. She saw me, ordered a drink for herself, and sat down. ""Hi, Jimmy. It's nice to see you today!""  
Rather than even attempt raspy speech, I just spoke telepathically. *Hi, Florence. Sorry for the weirdness, I have this condition where I randomly get super powers on a daily basis and today it seems to be telepathy. I'll try not to go too deep into your subconscious.* It was difficult, but I even managed to laugh at that last line, out loud, which prompted her to as well.  
We began drinking our coffee and talking about our lives. I occasionally caught surface thoughts from her, which did lead to me pre-empting her on a few things, such as getting her a refill, but overall I did my best to respect her boundaries. I should have known that wouldn't last.  
During a lull in the conversation, a couple sat down at the table next to us. Florence became notably distraught, and I soon found out why, though not from her mind. *Wait, is that Florence? Your daughter? Okay, keep it cool, Dave-man. Maybe she won't notice her father sitting at the table right next to her with a strange woman. Not that there's anything* **strange** *about her. Woo-Hoo.*  
I'd heard enough. I didn't know if Florence had noticed, but I did know that her father was both an idiot and a jerk. I quickly apologized to her, then punched her father in the face. At that point, she had definitely noticed. She ran off, crying. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  
I saw her in school the next day. I'll admit, the encounter was made more awkward by the day's power. I saw more than I wanted to. However, She explained that she had run off because of what she had just learned about her father. Apparently, her mother had just applied for a divorce last night because of my actions. So, it seemed that I hadn't messed up too bad. And, I managed to make it through almost the entire conversation without staring at her unicorn panties. Now I just needed to make it through another date. Which, of course, she had scheduled for that night.  
We went out dancing. Florence knew of a tremendous discoteche, so of course we had to go. We went out into the middle of the dance floor, and we danced. I'll admit, it was tempting to spend the entire night just staring at her, but I managed to resist. Mostly. I still stole a few glances.  
We danced for quite some time, but I was soon tuckered out. We went to the bar, just to sit down. That's when I saw him. A man, who looked pretty similar to Mr. LeBoum, in a trenchcoat and fedora. I was suspicious, of course, and even more so when I saw that he had a gun underneath the coat. Of course, I couldn't let Florence know what the day's power was, or she'd likely realise what I had been staring at all night, and think I was some kind of pervert.  
I tried the straight forwards approach first. ""You know, I'm feeling pretty tired. Maybe we should go home?"" I should have known that wouldn't work by the way she bounced up and down in her chair, but it was worth a shot.  
""Are you kidding me? The night's still so young! There's so much that we can do!""  
I decided to instead try to use safety in numbers. After all, Mr. LeBoum couldn't kill everyone at the discotheque. So, I pulled Florence to the middle of the dance floor, and we started to dance. Of course, I didn't completely give up on plan A; whenever Florence would start to look tired, I would suggest we go back home, but she kept denying it.  
Finally, the clock struck midnight. I knew that meant a new power; it was one of the first things I checked after I had been zapped. All I had to do is hope it would be a useful one. And that's when my skin turned green.  
Florence didn't notice right away; it was quite bizarrely lit in the discotheque, and she really was quite tired. I, however, did notice right away. Knowing what to try for I quickly found I was able to change the colour of my skin completely, and even blend colours. Of course, my experiments didn't go unnoticed by Florence.  
""Hey, is there something weird with your skin?"" Still wanting to get out of there without her father seeing us, I decided to play along.  
""Uh...yeah, it seems like there is. Probably just one of those weird power things I mentioned on Sunday. I should probably get home."" As I spoke, I made sure to emphasize the changes on my skin, directly contrasting the lights and making things look really weird.  
Florence agreed to walk me home, though admittedly I dropped her off, as her house was closer to the discotheque. I don't know if Mr. LeBoum tried to follow me, but I do know that if he somehow saw through my camouflage, he saw more than he wanted to. I couldn't change my clothes colours, after all.  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  
I stayed home sick the next day. Both because of how late I had been up, and because I didn't seem to have complete control over my powers. I could only make basic colours, like green or red. Skin toned was out of the question, and I didn't want to be asked too many of those. Thus, no school on Tuesday.  
On Wednesday, I seemed to have a strange power that I didn't even want to think about. Unfortunately, it wasn't *physically* damaging, so I went to school as normal. I ran into Florence. It turned out that her dad was arrested on Tuesday morning for possession of a concealed weapon. Concealed to everyone else, at least. Florence seemed to be in a much happier mood, though that may have been because of me. The power of 'All my clothes turning into dresses' wasn't really something I wanted. However, she did still ask me out on a third date, so that was something.  
I wish I had asked what we would be doing. All she had given me was an address, and my forced attire wasn't really suited for rollerskating. However, Florence seemed happy to see me, and completely avoided the obvious topic of conversation.  
We grabbed our skates, and put them on. Naturally, when I put mine on, they became pink and sparkly. Of course they did. Combine that with the fact that, for whatever reason, my hair had grown, and I looked like quite the convincing girl. Florence didn't seem to mind, however. She treated me like myself, even though I didn't feel much like it. We had fun.  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  
The next day, I heard a news bulletin. Apparently, there was a hitman who had been captured last night, after our roller date. He had apparently been hired by Mr. LeBoum, and claimed that he had been given orders to kill ""That guy she was goin' out with"", but that all he saw was a couple of girls. That was the happiest I had ever been to have been wearing a dress.",gemohandy

[OT] please post a story you want read aloud.,gabbrain,"Bella was a good girl, a sweet little thing, adored by both our family and friends. My wife and I had raised her to be the best. It was easy, especially because we were both raised in strict homes with strong role models. 

We taught her manners first, then how to respect others and show kindness and love. I would watch whenever we visited somewhere and make sure that Bella hugged everyone, greeting with ‘Hello, how are you?’ 

But then an atrocity happened to our family, Aunt Maria had passed on. 

She was mugged and stabbed by a street thug, a boy with a poor upbringing who had been living on the streets at sixteen. 

When attending the funeral, I heard the other adults lie to Bella, they told her all kinds of fluffy tales: Aunty is sleeping, she’s gone on holiday, and she’s having a rest . . .  The onslaught of lies came one after the other. Gritting my teeth and listening, I waited until we got home to tell my sweet darling the truth. 

I took her to one side and said, “Bella, darling. Aunt Maria has died, she was attacked by a bad man with a knife and she won’t be coming back anymore.” Puzzled, she gazed at me with big eyes. “Did the man hurt her dad?” I nodded, “When a person gets hurt real bad they go on, into the afterlife. They don’t stay here anymore. . .”

Watching her, she scrunched her brow, her little mind filling in the details. She nodded at me, “Thanks dad.” 

Smiling, I ruffled her hair, “It’s better for you to know, darling.” 

“Aunt Maria is safe now, right Dad?” 

I nodded, “That’s right.” 

She ran upstairs to play with her dolls, I threw on the soccer, feeling a weight lift off my shoulders. I made it my sole responsibility as her father to tell her the truth - excluding Santa Clause and the tooth fairy - it was best that she knew. 

I dozed and when my eyes opened again there were garbage infomercials on TV. A yell echoed from upstairs, my wife dropped what she was doing in the kitchen and we ran to my daughter’s room. 

There sat my girl with her toys in a circle around her. Poking a knife into each toy and screaming, “Hello, could you all please die?” 

Running to her side, I snatched the knife from her hand. My wife covered her mouth as she walked in after me. 

“W-Why where you doing that Bella?” My wife asked. I collapsed, holding blade in a shaky hand. 

Bella looked up at me with big puppy eyes. “I just wanted them to be safe. . . With Aunty Maria.”

I gulped, knowing full well what she meant. 

Maybe there are some things kids don't need to know. . .

It is a cold November day when they finally get around to killing us. The sleet comes down steadily all morning. They march us down the street through town. Everyone's lined up on the sidewalk in attendance. I guess they want everyone to see what happens to saboteurs. Twenty two of us they're killing. The local baker is the oldest, eighty three and Daniel's only sixteen. Shit, I told his sister I'd take care of him. I told her nothing would happen to the boy. Well, what's one more broken promise in this shitty world. But why does Sam have to be by my side? She's my oldest friend in the world. She's all I have left. Even now she flashes me a smile. As if to tell me it will all be ok. No, it won't.

How many times did I stopped by her father's flower shop? How many hours did we spend in the coffee shop downtown? How many nights did we spend out under the stars making love? Not enough. So I look into her eyes now, making each second last a lifetime. She smiles again, and I cannot help myself but to smile back. She starts to hum a song. One I taught her. ""Sam Hall"" I teased her with it growing up together. Samantha Hall's her name. I thought I was so witty back then. Now, I think the song is fitting.

The crowd is staring daggers at the soldiers. Everyone is well aware what will happen once we reach the bridge. They have brothers, sisters, sons, fathers among the condemned. It is only the machine guns on the APC's that are keeping the crowds in line. The soldiers know this. The march is silent, save for the disciplined cadence of the garrison and the shuffle of the prisoners. My boots have seen better days, and Lars' going barefoot. They took him from his bed three nights ago. Emily's making a stranger sound, courtesy of her crutches. She was crippled in an ambush gone bad. The satchel charge went off too early and took her left foot with it. It's a shame, she used to be a ballet dancer, though it won't matter soon anyway.

We've reached the bridge. It's not a bad bridge, if that's your thing.  I've crossed it plenty of times. Only now am I paying close attention to it, to the rusting bolts and the chipping paint peeling away from the spots of aging iron. It's seen better days. Odd how it is, how knowing your live will soon be extinguished and the knowledge makes everything seem so much clearer, as if the fog of life's been lifted and you've finally been allowed to see the world as it truly is.

So, will they hang us or shoot us? I'm guessing on the former. Some nice scarecrows waving in the breeze to send a clear and grisly message. ""This is what happens to people who try be a hero."" My heart sinks when I start seeing them tie our legs together. They are tying us by twos. I know what is going to happen. Sam looks at me, I try to look calm. But I am sure she can tell. She's known me for eighteen years. Never have I won at poker with her. She can tell when I'm lying. They tie Sam and me together, back to back. Our legs are bound as well. They are going to throw us into the river alive, to drown. Then comes both my most fervent prayer and my greatest nightmare.

They shoot Timothy Cooper in the head, and leave Alec alive, shoving them both over the side and into the freezing water. Tim's body and Alec don't surface. Only the rippling water of the river marks their grave. They aren't even bothering to put both out of their misery. Stinking misers aren't going to waste two bullets when one can do the job. So they continue down the line. Daniel gets the bullet, a small mercy, and Nathan gets to drown. He rained curses on them as they threw him over the side. Emily screams as she falls towards the icy water. So on down the line. 

Oh, God. If there is any justice in this world, let Sam get the bullet, let her die easy. Let me die painfully, that's all I want. Her, not me. *Her*, not me. Please. I beg you.

I hear the sound of boots approaching. I hear the sound of a hammer being cocked back.

 Please. 

I hear the bang of the gunshot. I hear it! 

Her blood soaks into my shoulder, her head slumping back to rest against me as if she was just asleep. Her blood is white hot against my skin, and joy burns within my breast like fire.

*Thank you.*

Tears of happiness drip down my cheeks as I smile.

""Thank you."" It is a whisper.

""Thank you."" Louder.

""Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."" Her blood stains my shirt a brilliant crimson.

""Thank you! Thank you!"" Unashamed tears carve channels through the ash on my face.

 They tip Sam's body and me over the railing like some macabre human sacrifice, I'm screaming at the top of my lungs, ""Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!"" I keep screaming as the wind rushes past my ears, Sam's blood blinding my eyes. The water is cold, terribly cold. But I do not care. I'm too happy to care. The world grows colder, and dimmer, the shadows drawing nearer. The last of the air escapes me as I shout joy, allowing the freezing water to fill my lungs. Darker. Darker still as all light fades away and surrenders to darkness. But then, a spark, fragile and beautiful and pure. Her.",LovableCoward

[WP] Your roommate is an annoying fan of a certain superhero. He/she does not yet know you are that superhero.,laxnut90,"Raymond was only my roommate out of convenience. We had lived in the same town, went to the same High School, and all the while I couldn't stand him. He was a pseudo-intellectual prick with greasy hair, thick-rimmed glasses, and wouldn't stop blabbing about how 'weird' and how much of a 'nerd' he was. Whilst his fake knowledge in the sciences  -*""I have a theory on quantum relativity and how it interacts with exotic matter in an extradimensional vacuum!""*- bothered me, it wasn't what I detested most about him. Neither was the fact that his mother and mine got along swimmingly, which led to the rich, smug bastard inviting me to go 'halvsies' (I negotiated 75-25 in my favor, thankfully) on a nice apartment in the city. What Raymond did that ticked me off the most was have a closet-shrine to 'his hero', the superhero that the media had dubbed 'Metalhead'.

I didn't even like metal! Yes, I was the famous do-gooder that had been horribly mislabeled. The name roots from the actually-practical helmet I use to conceal my identity and voice. Let me tell you, the other heroes in the greater Boston area just *don't* care if you know who they are! I mean, not really; but with the skimpy little raccoon-masks they wear, they might as well just yell out *""My name is Todd Williamson, and this is my home address!""* Don't get me started on Incredible Man! The impractical eyesore that he thinks passes for superhero getup? Please! And a CAPE! THERE ARE NO BENEFITS TO CAPES! They're more likely to get you caught in a jet engine-


Sorry. I got a little carried away there. Anyway, yes, I am... Ugh... ""Metalhead"", but I'm really Todd Williamson. And yes, my annoying-as-balls roommate does in fact has a shrine to my alter-ego in his closet whilst all my garb and gadgets are in another hidden closet not 500 feet away. 

It kinda sucks. I mean, sure, I save people's lives and all that boring old superhero stuff on an almost daily basis. To tell the truth, I prefer being Todd. Not just because of the different perspective on the city I saved for the twenty-seventh time just mere hours before. Nor is it the 'carefree, relaxed break from the crushing responsibility of the whole city depending on you."" What I like is just... Being me. Not five-year-old me's fantasy, but the genuine article. I like to talk to my parents, my siblings- all of them know what I do, besides running the bookstore. I wouldn't keep a secret like that from them! And, honestly... I like torturing Raymond. I mean, seeing as how he devotes roughly  forty-eight percent of his constant talking to that cool thing I did last night, it's kind of awesome to know what *really* happened. It's satisfying, and that I've only lost thirteen of our bi-weekly bets on where Metalhead will be spotted tomorrow night! -Yes, thirteen seems like a lot for someone in my position, but I can't let him get *too* suspicious of me. There have been a few times that have been too close for comfort, though. 

The problem with Raymond ritualistically devoting a portion of his time to me everyday is that it gets a little... Stalker-y. One time, after stopping a bank robbery, I came back to the apartment late -bringing both pizza and a valid excuse, as always. And, as always, Raymond started up his *""Did'ja hear?! Metalhead &lt;Insert bland, routine thing for me, but awesome and crazy thing to Raymond&gt;""* This one time, however, I shut him up a little too quickly. 

We were sitting on the couch, eating pizza, and watching the news. As the Metalhead-recap segment began, I replied: ""Yeah, I watched it on the store's TV. Did you hear the robber start crying?"" With unhindered enthusiasm, Raymond answered. ""YEAH! That was my favorite part. Did *you* hear Metalhead's witty quip?"" A little too quickly and a little too coldly, I snapped at him. ""Metalhead doesn't so those for the press anymore.""

Raymond looked at me, and I still can't describe his expression. ""I mean, I didn't hear any comment on the station I was watching."" I hurriedly spat out, trying to salvage my identity.

I think it worked, because soon enough we were back eating pizza. Even though I went into this describing him... Less than favorably, Raymond and I are friends. (There's just no other way to describe him.) I can't hate the guy, really. It's moments like those that make me respect him, even if a little. But... I'm getting nervous. Sure, its okay for a guy to have a superhero watching hobby, but I'm turning into an obsession of his. In his defense, I did design the suit to be cool and my modulated voice bad-ass, but I'm just one of many superheroes around the country. I'll admit it; Incredible Man, douche as he may be, is far cooler than Metalhead. I don't even have any powers, just a nifty suit, cool mask, and sweet gadgets. However, there are still conspiracy theories on how I 'came back from the dead.'


Back to Raymond, though... That's the thing that fascinates him the most. My 'death'. Get out of your suit to take a piss in the middle of a battle ONE TIME... That's all it was.

A summary of what happened:
My arch-nemesis, Death Ray, fired off a blast that did nothing to my suit. However, due to aforementioned piss, it was on auto-pilot. I hadn't yet programmed in what to do when faced with 'quantum anti-matter bolts' (*complete bullshit, by the way, Death Ray has no knowledge of science*), and do my suit merely shut down for a moment to process things, check for damage, y'know. Anyway, from what I'd heard, it was *way* more dramatic looking than that. All the lights in the suit turned off, it dropped out of the sky, and fell into the Charles River. The press made a really big deal out of it. Anyway, I finished my pissing, and disabled auto-pilot, which automatically reboots the suit and has it fly back and retrieve me. At this point, ""Metal"" without its ""Head"" had been under some nasty water for about half an hour. Death Ray scanned 0 signs of life, and rejoiced for this period. Then, to the confused and scared onlookers, Metalhead rose from the water, and 'came back to life'. This, accompanied by an ""Impossible!"" from Death Ray sent everyone NUTS.


...But nowhere near as nuts as Raymond. He has a bulletin board with pictures,  images from security cameras, eyewitness reports... The lot. He's even got an analysis of the water in the Charles. I'm not supposed to see it, but he's got sketches and proposed details of my suit, and none of it accounts for an oxygen tank. In fact, this inspired me to add one last Thursday. Moving on, Ray's been a little weird since then. I've had to be on guard, because he's been bouncing ideas off of me for how it happened... This was a month ago. Also, Death Ray, my nemesis (who really should just stick with normal lasers and his namesake) has been quiet. I've been observing him for quite some time now.


In fact, we had lived in the same town, went to the same High School, and I share an apartment with him. Ray is only my roommate out of convenience. Convenience for me.

Momma says that everyone puts their pants on one leg at a time, and she always told me that means ain't nobody better then nobody else. Everyone is equal. You know, the Golden Rule, and all that. But recently, somethin' happened to me to make me realize that...well, not everyone wears pants, plain and simple. And me? I'm one of'em.

Couple years ago, I woke up and I knew everything...and I mean everything! It took me this long to start to get it myself to tell ya the truth. I knew how to see where my brothers and sisters would run to hide in when we played hide'n'go seek. I started to hear people say things, but their mouths wouldn't open up and they wouldn't speak. I knew how to pick up things...real heavy things. Like that big rock down at the end of our dirt-road of a driveway. That thing pro'lly ways 1,000 pounds! It's as big around as a kiddie pool, and 'bout as tall as the mailbox...but I knew just how to lift it up off the ground straight 
up over my head. 

Now, I watch the news every mornin' with my Dad, and every mornin' he's always runnin on an on 'bout how 'the world's gone to sheeyit', and how 'things ain't nothin' like they should be'. He'd see on the TV that some lady in the city'd been shot up, or maybe some city somewhere'd been blown up by evil or somethin', and he'd pray to God to protect us in the times comin'. It wasn't just father, neither. Momma...she wouldn't say nothin' out loud, but you could see it in her eyes when she looked out the window sometimes...that blank look. A look that just screamed ""I'm lost, and I need me a little help"". And all that pray-talkin' and sad-lookin' made me realize that I knew what I was supposed to do about it. I'd stop all those things from happenin'. I'd make good news, 'stead'a bad news. 

I still remember the first time like it was happenin' right in front of me. I was wearin' my snow-mask undermy hood, and even though I knew what was gonna happen, and even HOW it was gonna happen, I wasstill shakin like a willow in the wind. I knew I was strong, stronger'n any man alive...faster too. And I knew what people were thinking, what they would do 'fore they even decided to do it. But I was still as scared as a cat  bein' chased by a crow. 

I was in my bed when I heard the men talkin' 'bout how they were gonna shoot up police headquarters that weekend. Somehow, even from my bed I could smell onions on the first mans breath. I put on my ""costume"" and ran to the diner they were talkin' at (I could run faster that a bat outta hell), and followed them back to a house on the corner'a Sherman and 4th, the ugly brown one with the dead oak tree out front. I knew how to look right through the walls of the house, so I could see them sittin' on a couch playin' what looked like go fish. I could also see what was all around them in the room, and the answer was guns. Lot's of'em. Explosives too. 

But I reckon I already knew that.

I walked up onto the porch and knocked on the door. It was hotter that hellfire right about now, and humid too. Right now was mid-August in Laurel, Mississippi, and there was more water'n there was actual air. Sweat stood out and fell down my forehead, but not all of it was from the heat. A big, bearded man, the one with the onion-breath, answered the door. He looked down at me and laughed. It sounded crazy and twisted, and maybe like he smoked too many packs a day.

""Halloween ain't for another coupl'a months, kid"", he spat. ""Get outta here, 'less you want a reason to start cryin'!"" He slammed the door, locked it and went back into the living room to play cards.

~~~~~

Rudy looked up from the cards in his hand as John walked back into the room. ""Who the hell was that?"" he asked, looking back down at his hand. ""Got any sixes?"" he asked, casually.

John grunted and put the pistol he had been holding behind his back onto the table. ""Some fuckin' kid in a ski-mask, can you fuckin' believe it? And no I ain' got no god damned sixes, go fish!"" John fell back onto the couch and picked up his cards. 

""Ski-mask...Like a costume? Halloween ain't for another couple'a months, though..."" Rudy muttered, chewing on his cigarette, apparently thinking

""That's what I said! Must be retarded or somethin'"" John lit a cigarette. ""Got any fuckin Ace's?"" 

~~~~~

I knew what was gonna happen next, but that didn't make movin' my feet any easier to do. I pushed the door open with force enough to break the lock open. Wood splintered and flew from the panel as the door was smashed inward by the power of my gentle shove. The men in the next room jumped out of their skin and onto their feet, picking up guns and running into the foyer to gun down the intruder. If only *they* knew, like *I*  knew. The thought made me feel just a tad better.

Onion breath couldn't hold it in any longer. ""Whaaat the ***FUCK***, Kid?"" He yelled  at me; ""look at what you done now, ya little *shit*! Now we gotta put you down you stupid little ***fuck***!"" He leveled his gun with my head and open fired. I was behind them before the bullets even left the barrel. You'da laughed all night to see the look on his face when he realized I wasn't there.
 
""What the..""

Before either of them could figure out what had happened, I clocked the second man in the head, and he fell down sleepin. Onion-breath saw that his bud was out of the fight, and turned to face me. ""Alright, kid. You fuckin asked for it!"" He lunged for me with murder in his eyes, hands reaching for my throat intent on takin' my life. I grabbed him by his chest, stopping him in his tracks, and picked him up off of the ground just like I did with the big rock at the end of the drive.

He squealed like a stuck pig as I flung him through the wall into the next room. I dragged his partner in with me and tossed him onto the couch. I tied'em up with the duct tape on the table and contacted the police with the second man's phone. I found it in his jacket pocket while I was tapin' 'em together. I left them like that for the police to find, and I that night I slept better than a rock. Dad'n I heard 'bout it on the news the next mornin'. The smile on his face right then....that was the best thing I've ever seen.

Guardian Tower had always been the hub for all sorts of heroes, both super powered and mundane in nature. Anyone who wanted to help was welcome, even if they had no specialties, it was important to keep a connected network around the nation in order to address possible threats as quickly as possible.

This meeting was only for super heroes though, so when the young boy entered the reception room and looked around, slightly confused she knew two things. One, this child had never been to Guardian Tower, and two, he was entirely too young to be super in anything. This happened a lot more than most people would think though—young children always looked up to heroes, both real and imaginary, and wished that they could be like the people they admired—so Amelia was used to gently fending off children and reporters who were only there to snoop. She slowly stood up and walked around the desk to the still waiting child.

“Can I help you?” she asked in a gentle tone with her best customer service smile in place.

The kid, who could be no older than ten or eleven, scratched the back of his head and looked up at her from under his eyelashes. “Umm, I was told to go to room seven in the conference wing,” he said and again looked around, as though he were expecting someone.

“Well, I’m sorry sweet. I don’t know how you heard about this meeting, but its only for those who are super hero in nature, not for little kids,” she answered him, her smile still in place, though she was starting to think that he was not going to leave as easily as she had hoped.

He sighed and his shoulders seemed to drop a little. Amelia hoped he wasn’t about to cry. The only experience she had with crying children was when she held her boyfriend’s niece for ten minutes while he ran out to the car to get her birthday gift, and she had learned very quickly that she did not have an affinity for children, especially when they started crying at such a high pitch.

“Look,” he finally answered her. “Could you just call the The White Rose down here for me, please? I don’t want to make any trouble, but she insisted I come here today, so here I am, and you were supposed to be told to expect me so this wouldn’t happen and I would really appreciate if you wouldn’t treat me like a child right now.”

Amelia was quiet through his whole speech and when he was done, she stared down at him shocked and annoyed. It had been a more adult speech than she had expected from him, but she still could not take him seriously. He was a child and everyone knew the name of The White Rose, so him quoting her as a confidant made no difference to her. “This is your last chance to leave,” she said as she stood and rounded her table again. When he still did not move she picked up her phone and pressed the number for the tower security. She explained the situation and then hung up the phone. “Security is coming,” she told him.

He rolled his eyes in annoyance. “I heard. I’m young, not deaf.” His derogatory tone only served to make her more annoyed with the situation and him. She looked forward to the guards kicking him out of the building.

The two guards came walking up casually, in no rush to deal with her problem, but when she saw who they were talking with all her annoyance rushed away. Tomahawk was striding easily alongside the men, his smile lighting up the small reception room. With his dark tanned skin, his long straight black hair, and his handmade soft hide skin clothes melding to every muscle, he was a favorite among most of the young female population, and some of the men as well. A favorite with Amelia herself as well, a fact which she never tried to hide. There had to be some perks for working here after all, or so she had always hoped.

“Amelia, how are you this morning?” he asked, his radiant smile still in place.

“Very amazing,” she said and then blushed at her poor choice of wording, worrying what he’d think. But he just smiled wider and tilted his head. “What seems to be the problem,” he asked, looking around from his six foot three inch height.

“Really, Hawk. I’m not that short,” the kid spoke up with a sigh and Amelia wanted to once again see him kicked out and humiliated. How dare he be so casual with a hero like Tomahawk; but her confusion only grew as she saw his eyes brighten and his lips turn up in a more genuine smile than she had ever seen. He turned around quickly and knelt down, gathering the kid up in a bear hug and squeezing him.

“Rose said you were going to show up, but I didn’t believe her. And here you are. I owe her a raspberry tart, now,” he said with a laugh and an extra squeeze before setting the child back on his feet.

The now only frowned and tugged his clothes back into place. “You know I hate when you treat me like a little kid like that,” he answered in a slightly plaintive voice. But Tomahawk wasn’t listening. As he moved to stand he grabbed the child up in his arms and lifted him up. The boy frowned but seemed to be resigned to being held by a national hero. And now that he was on more of an even level with herself, Amelia noticed there was something off about his eyes.
She couldn’t contain her curiosity any longer. “Who is he, Tomahawk?” she asked, though she knew her tone conveyed even more: what right does he have to be here? She winced inward at the snotty tone she had used with one of her heroes, but it was too late to take it back now.

“You don’t know?” Tomahawk asked her, his tone astonished with maybe a hint of annoyance. Now she really wanted to take it back. “Didn’t you ask him?” Tomahawk continued and Amelia realized she had not even asked the child what his name was. She ducked her head as she felt her cheeks growing red.

“Leave it be, Hawk,” the child spoke up. “No one expects what I am in this body. It’s ok, Amelia,” he answered and she looked up at him then. His eyes looked straight at her and it was then that Amelia realized he had kept his head down most of their conversation. 

His eyes were the vast darkness of empty space, no colored iris, no white sclera, just a depthless black void. Demon eyes, many news publications had called them when he had first stepped into the limelight. But those eyes seemed to grab and hold her attention, and as she continued to stare she could see, in their depths, tiny stars and galaxies, swirling around bright suns that grew and died in the space of moments. Galaxies formed and then spun out of orbit to crash and break apart, only to start anew. She knew in an instant that he was young, and also very very old. She could see it in his eyes. Whatever he was, was not completely of this Earth and he knew things that no human ever would or could comprehend.

Then their gaze was broken as he turned his head to the side and looked down. “Sorry,” he mumbled, but Amelia couldn’t think of a response she wanted to give, or could even manage at that moment. This child, this small, almost innocent and insignificant seeming child, was Cosmos. There were scientists who theorized that Cosmos was part alien, which was why he was so powerful. He knew things that no could have ever told him and was smarter than most geniuses alive today. And with the genetic advancements of the current day, that was saying something.

But she had never heard that he was a child.

She watched as Tomahawk carried him back to the elevators, still talking to him excitedly and she slowly sat back down in her seat. How had she not known who he was? She felt like she had somehow failed at her job. Would Tomahawk ever talk to her again?

The door swung open again and as a smiling man walked into the reception room and proclaimed himself to be Cutlass, all she could do was point him toward the elevators with a distracted wave.

"[WP] You are a wizard so powerful that no one could possibly defeat you and almost every problem you have can instantly be solved using magic. You are incredibly bored. Today, someone has asked to be your apprentice.",laxnut90,"A great fire roared, its flames dancing from red to blue to green, its smoke twisting into shapes uncounted. Above the mantle a great fossilized dragon skull stared with lifeless eyes at El’Khazara, the greatest wizard to ever wield a staff. 

A pleasant music drifted across the stuffy air of the study, played on unseen instruments, its notes teasing at a creator far beyond mortal talent. El’Khazara made a quick gesture, and the tempo increased. Another gesture, and the tune shifted to the minor register. Another gesture, and it stopped. 

The prodigious wizard, the incarnation of true power, lounged in his large leather chair, one leg slung over an armrest and puffed at his pipe. He was bored.

A sack of gold coins lay at his feet, remnants from his morning practice session. A mind is like a sword, his former master had taught him, and just as a sword required a whetstone, so too does a mind require constant sharpening. El’Khazara was not sure how much sharper his mind could grow. He waved his fingers, muttered a line of ancient and terrible magic, and the bag of gold levitated into the air, grew, , spun, disappeared, reappeared, turned to silver, stacked itself in neat rows along the mantle, returned to gold, and melted. The molten gold flowed from the mantle and into an invisible mold, forming into the shape of a small human.

Moments later the golden effigy trembled, flexed its mixture muscles, and stepped forwards. “Greetings, my Liege,” it said in a tiny, metallic voice. El’Khazara stared at it absently, puffed on his pipe, and waved his fingers again, hurling the homunculus into the fire, where it melted once more.

“So… bored,” El’Khazara muttered. He rose from his chair, stretched out the aches of the day, and strode over to a desk set against the far wall of the study. He swept an arm through the air, and a collection of skulls and vials, trinkets and gemstones flew from the desk, revealing a large, open tome. A small bag leapt from the ground and caught the detritus before it could fall. The bag jumped onto the desk and wriggled excitedly.

El’Khazara absentmindedly petted the animated bag of holding while he scrutinized the book. He puffed on his pipe and ran a finger down the lines of fine handwriting. “So, Ignaceous,” the wizard said to the animated sack, “what do you say to a bit of travel?” The bag bounced up and down and ran a tight circle around the book.

 El’Khazara stopped on a line, adjusted his spectacles, and leaned back. He could use a bit of travel, a small vacation from the trivialities of running a kingdom. A wry smile cracked beneath his white moustache.

In one fluid movement, the wizard shut the book, snatched up the small bag, placed it on his shoulder, and snapped his fingers. A long, dark staff flew across the room and into his waiting grasp. On his shoulder the bag of holding purred, and wrapped itself into the wizard’s long flowing locks. “Well, Ignaceous, I do believe a day at the beach sounds absolutely wonderful, don’t you?” The bag yipped with a voice like a sack of glass vials. In fact, that might explain his missing experiment. 

It had been quite a while since El’Khazara had ventured out of his kingdom. Decades ago, before his conquest, he had traveled quite often, but the years had taken their toll on the ageing wizard, and he found himself locked in his study, or presiding over tedious affairs of state, far too often as of late.

The beach. He had always loved the beach. And why not? The kingdom could rule itself for a few days. Gods knew the people were too terrified to rebel.

With the animated sack snoring languidly on his shoulder, El’Khazara collected his gear, donned an exquisite satin robe, and walked over to a doorway set into the granite wall of the study. It was little more than a ring of engraved stones, time-stained and heavily scored. El’Khazara touched the stones in a very careful order and muttered several more lines of eldritch power. He felt the warm, familiar tingle of raw magic ripple out from the portal, and the runes glowed. Moments later, where once had been only bare stone, a haze poured from the stones like smoke, filling the portal.

With one last cursory glance around his disheveled study, El’Khazara stepped through the portal.

And into chaos.

A tremendous noise, a true cacophony, assaulted the aging wizard. As the world swam into focus he stared wide-eyed as a great armored beast charged, no more than a dozen paces out. With surprising agility El’Khazara leapt, clearing the beast and landing in a roll. He rose, dusted off his robes, and leveled a stare that would make a statue bow. He was about to launch a most sinister curse at the ferocious beast when another trumpeted, and he leapt again.

He landed in a puddle. 

“Gods dammit, I must have miscalculated! Blast and bugger!” he hollered. The bag of holding quivered and burrowed deeper into the wizard’s mighty mane.

“Hey, guy, get outta the road will ya? Jesus.” 

El’Khazara swung his glare to meet the voice, but the speaker was gone, apparently riding the fearsome armored mount.

For the first time, the wizard took a hard look at his surroundings. He could hear the beach, smell the familiar salt air, but there was something else, something sinister in the air. Smoke? Was this a siege? Before him, rows of the heavily armed carriages careened down the avenue. Perhaps there was war afoot. Perhaps his boredom would be curtailed!

But no, it couldn’t be. There were throngs about, dozens, hundreds, all milling about under the sun, all dressed in clothes utterly foreign to the experienced wizard. And such immodesty! And they were laughing, talking, frolicking, none were running. No war. Dammit.

He was shouldered, and again, and again. The crowd seemed to roil around him, paying him no heed. As the most powerful being in existence, El’Khazara was used to a wide berth wherever he walked, and those who infringed did not live long enough to tell the tale. But not here, wherever he was.

Enough. He was El’Khazara, the great and powerful, the undisputed ruler of Kerza! He prepared a spell most devastating. He would cast fear into these… these… these peasants! He muttered the spell, braced himself, and slammed his staff into the earth.

Nothing happened.

Frustrated, he tried again.

Nothing.

“Gods…” he muttered. There must be another wizard about, he must be caught in some perverse trap. It was not uncommon for rival wizards to battle, and some of the older ones could be quite devious. He must be on his guard. He must be aware of any and all…

“Hey mister?”

There was a slight tug on his robe. El’Khazara the Terrible looked down the bridge of his long and distinguished nose to see a small noy. “What is it, child?” El’Khazara asked, employing the slow, booming timber he preferred when in the presence of the inferior.

“Why were you standing in the road, mister? Aren’t you afraid of the cars?”

El’Khazara the Mighty was at a loss for words. It had been so long since anybody had the gall to speak so informally to one as powerful as he. “Uh, come again child?” “The cars, mister. Mom says never to walk in the street, or you’ll get hit!”

El’Khazara processed the words. “What is a… oh never mind. Good day child.” He strode off, leaving the young child in a wake of whirling robe. His magic, why was the weave not responding to his call? For good measure, he tried a simple incantation, a spell he had cast several times that very day. 

Nothing.

The wizard broke out in a cold sweat. “Ignaceous, it would seem that…” he reached up to his shoulder, but the magical sack was gone. Spinning on his heels, El’Khazara the Almighty saw the young boy laughing, chasing the small brown sack. “Ignaceous get over here this instant!” Even without magic the wizard’s voice carried an undeniably authoritative tone. The boy and the bag froze mid-chase.

If it had a head, the bag would have stared at its feet as it guiltily ambled over to the wizard. The boy followed curiously, and watched as El’Khazara bent down and picked up the small bag and placed it on his shoulder. 

“What kinda dog is that, mister?” the boy asked. El’Khazara shook his head. “It is not a… dog… child. It is a familiar.” The child screwed up his face, “it doesn’t look familiar to me, mister.” The two stared at each other for a heartbeat, and to his surprise the aged wizard let out a small chuckle. “I wouldn’t think it does, child.” 

The child maintained his stare, and the wizard shuffled his feet. “Well… good day.” He turned and continued down the avenue, wincing as each screaming behemoth passed beside him. The child followed. “Where are ya goin mister?”

El’Khazara the Everlasting ignored the child, and picked up his pace. The child laughed and trotted behind him. The wizard could hear Ignaceous mewling on his shoulder. “Oh shut up, Iggy, we have bigger proverbial fish to fry.” The bag slumped, and coughed up a gold coin.

“Hey mister, you dropped something!” El’Khazara let out an exasperated sigh and turned around again. The child was chasing after him, holding up the coin. “Bugger” muttered the wizard.

"[WP] Thousands of years after the robot-revolution has long since been forgotten, sentient AI have begun to create biological lifeforms in order to perform basic tasks. Today, they have developed a new lifeform they have decided to call a ""human.""",laxnut90,"Sounds came first, though I had no words for them back then. The whooshing of my liquid infused world, the steady thump of my own heartbeat. The clicking sounds whenever they would come to check on me. All sounds were louder in my before-life world; more distinct.

Then came sight, and though that was not as good yet, I could still see shapes within and without my world. My own hand was the first thing I saw; it seemed strange to me. A flattened node with five long extensions that bent and twisted when I chose to move them. It fascinated me. Until the day when I saw the first shadow outside of my world. That was the day I learned that there was more than what I had known or ever thought there to be. And I wanted to know more.

The shadows always accompanied the clicking sounds, and I still heard better than I saw. So I would listen, and when the first tell-tale signs of clicking would reach my ears, I would start looking and I would wonder. Were these others like me? Would I ever see what they really looked like? These thoughts would plague me for long spaces of time as I floated in my world.

Then came the day that something changed. My world had begun to feel small and cramped and I could no longer move about as easily as I had been used to. There was a pressure all around me and a bright light suddenly pierced my dim world. Instinct made me reach for that light, though part of me still was reluctant to leave the only world I had known. The decision was taken away from me as I was forced into that bright world where I was left blinking up at brightness that hurt and shadows that now loomed over me and I wanted nothing more than to return to my watery world with the dim red glow that did not hurt and the shadows that were too far away to be frightening.

My eyes slowly adjusted and I stared around at the beings who had moved very little since I had come into this new world. Their bodies were rounded and curving, with soft looking flesh and bright glowing orbs in the top most portion. The clicking sound came again, though duller than I remembered it being inside my before-life world. And then they spoke.

“This one seems successful,” one said.

“It looks the most like the ancient pictographs,” another answered.

“We will have to test it though,” the first spoke again. “The younger versions were not very intelligent. We will have to see if keeping it within the artificial womb for extended years with the neural uplink improved its thinking processes.”

I could comprehend the words, though their meaning still confused me. I did not understand what they meant or what those words meant for my future.

One leaned forward and I could see in its orbs—eyes, my mind provided—that there were tiny gears that moved and spun and it looked me over. It brought up a node with extensions much like my own—a hand—and laid it against my face. Its flesh was surprisingly soft, though it felt stiffer than my own and a word tried to worm its way to the front of my mind.

Fake. Though that word had as little meaning as all the others.

“Why would it not have worked,” said a third who had not spoken up yet. This voice seemed softer, gentler, and I turned toward it. “We have full downloads of the brains of the last of the organic rebels, and for much of our slave stock before they began to rebel. His mind is a mix of the most subservient and intelligent of his kind. I am sure he will be an asset to our maintenance division.”

“We shall see,” said the first, its tone seeming skeptical. “We could not successfully make the first ones serve us fully. What makes you think the histories won’t repeat themselves?”

“We didn’t make the first ones,” the one still bent in front of me said, “We made this one. He will obey us.” Its hand moved from my cheek to the top of my head where he began to rub his hand through the short strands of…hair in a manner that made me feel calmer. Safer. 

“What should we call him?” the third entity asked.

“We shall call him what his ancestors were. Human. And if he is successful he shall be the first of many,” the being beside me stood and held out a hand. “Human 01, stand and meet your creators.”

[WP] An extremely powerful superhero/villain is defeated by someone without powers. (Feel free to use an established universe if you want),laxnut90,The entire book Steelheart by Brandon Sanderson is devoted to this.,RotWS
[WP] You are an unwilling subject in an experiment to increase human intelligence. The scientists are unaware that your intelligence has already surpassed theirs.,laxnut90,"""Alright, Subject A-827, you know the drill."" the electronic voice boomed out from the stereos that were *supposed* to seem to come from nowhere, and everywhere. However, when you became the least bit wise about acoustics, you'd easily determine that the noise came from the same depression in the ceiling the lights were set into. The interrogation chamber was supposed to look imposing and disorienting, as each of the four sides of the room were exactly alike, with one-way mirrors on all sides. To add to the expected confusion, the voice came no discernible side in particular. Again, this was until you wised up in any kind of architecture, building infrastructure, hell- even interior design. 


At least, this is what I hoped the subject was thinking, if the experiment was working. Looking up from the microphone which turned my ordinary voice into a booming, robotic thing, I noticed that this week, A-827 was facing away from us. The 'us' in question were the team of scientists tasked with the technical aspects of achieving human super-intelligence. Even though I got coffee and had lunch with them, I wasn't really in their group. I was the government psychologist of the group. Sure, Davis was the one who measured their intelligence with a system that he himself had devised; I was tracking mental health. Apparently, I also had the best robot voice of our group, because I did the talking with the volunteers. I  mean, they *were* volunteers, right? I didn't know a whole lot about the project, and I'd been told my findings would be better if I kept it that way. I tried to look beyond how evil that sounds, and tried to believe the subjects were volunteered. They had to be.

Anyway, Davis, Suzanne, Bart, Katy, and myself were behind the one way mirror behind A-827. He appeared to be in deep thought. A good sign! I copied that down onto my notes. Another long moment of 'deep thought'. I exchanged confused and concerned glances with my coworkers. Leaning into the microphone again, I asked: ""Uh... A-827? Are you alright?""


There was a slow, calculated nod. 
""Well, uh... moving on. You've solved all the logic problems we've given you in a new record time! So, uh, good job!"" I hated the monotone filter. I was supposed to track the subject's mental health, so I tried to be friendly and enthusiastic to them, but the modulator stripped any feeling from my words.


A-827 remained emotionless, unresponsive. Looking around at my friends' faces, they were just as unsettled as me. In our previous weekly conferences, A-827 had been confused, a little scared, but generally compliant- he seemed like a good person, and I thought we were developing a friendly rapport. But... This week...


Maybe his situation was getting to him. I decided to be a little informal, to try and cheer him up. I asked around the room and was encouraged to be a little more blatantly friendly, but my request to turn the voice modulator off was denied. Anyway, I continued.

""Look, A-82~"" I cut off in the middle of 'seven'. I was told not to use the subjects' real names, for 'immersion' or something but ""A-827"" was not okay today, and if I was going to have to sound like a robot, I would have to sound human some other way.

""Jeremiah."" He straightened up, and seemed to be more... 'Awake'. ""Yes, hello! Good morning!"" Smiles throughout our little room. I thought I almost saw a smile appear on his face. 


""As you may have noticed, Jeremy~ or Jerry?"" I was told to stop pushing my luck with informality. However, 'Jerry' nodded at the his preferred nickname. I shot Davis, who lead the project, a look, and he approved it with a little wave.
""As you may have noticed, Jerry, this week's... Interaction? Meeting? I don't know. Whatever it is, it's a little different. You've been in the program for... 8 weeks now, yes? Well, you've been, just... Great. I don't say this to all the subjects, and that's because I'm usually not allowed to! Anyway, you've been in the Intelligent-Enhancement program the longest, so... Yay! Anyway, I'm pushing my luck, so I'll hand it over to Davis! (He's the guy who asks you about the boring intellectual crap.)""

I was getting weird looks from my coworkers as I handed Davis the microphone. I gave them a shrug, and mouthed the words ""I'm not good under pressure."" We were exiting the room when I saw Subject A-827 turn around on his stool and make eye contact with me.

""How is he doing that..?"" I quietly asked nobody in particular. ""How does he know~""  
""Thank you, Toby. You've been good to me.""


""He knows my name. He *knows* my *name*! HOW DOES HE KNOW MY-""  
I push past everyone, all of whom are standing still, mouths open. I grab the microphone from Davis, who doesn't object, and just quietly says ""There's no microphone in there, and a soundproof wall between us."" Oh, just fantastic: another chill runs up my spine, which is currently at like, zero Kelvin. (I don't know, I'm not a scientist.) 


I clear my throat, take a breath, and speak into the microphone.   
""I'm going to be really honest here. You're freaking me the FUCK out, Jerry.""   
I noticed the voice modulator was off; I didn't care.      
Now, I don't know if your new intelligence will make you in some kind of a position to just fucking explode my head with your mind or *whatever the fuck this project is doing.* I just kindly request that you DON'T DO ANYTHING EVIL TO US. AND YES, I MIGHT BE OVER REACTING."" I shuddered and let out a sigh.



 ""Look, I'm just a psychologist, Davis is just some government special project manager, Suzanne and Bart are just chemists, Katy is... HR? I think?"" Nobody else in the room seems to know. Katy nods, confused, but not offended. ""Yeah, HR. Anyway, none of us here really know what's going on. Now, I'm going to ask a few things of you:


First of all, please don't kill us with any crazy hyper-mind powers or in any way, for that matter. Secondly... Do you know what's going on?  
...Did you volunteer?""


Subject A-827 stopped what I interpreted as a creepy, serial-killer looking smile, and broke out in tears, shaking his head between sobs. I looked around the room, at everyone's individual faces. They all looked like they felt extreme pity, guilt, and disgust; realizing they had been pumping chemicals and testing an innocent. My eyes lastly fell on Davis. His face was expressionless, and his eyes filled with tears. First Davis, then all of us began to sob; for Jerry, for his life that would never be the same; because we ruined it. 


I was the first to compose myself. I locked the door that lead to the rest of the facility, and shattered the cover on the expensive window's controls. Damn wasteful funding. I pressed a button, and the glass became transparent and slid down into the wall. I climbed through, and slowly approached Jerry. 



I woke up with a headache exponentially worse than any I'd ever had. My eyes were burning, my head was pounding, and I didn't know where I was. All of a sudden, I saw images of mathematical problems, logic problems, and was horrified at the memory of pills in bland prison food.

Let's take a look at our contestants today!""

Stedman spun lavishly, three times in his chair before jumping up and walking towards the twelve of us. He wore a smart suit and red tie, his jet black hair strait up, like a cat arching its back. He walked up the steps and put an arm around the District 1 contestant, a guy who had been given a shirt that had a profuse amount of hair coming out of his armpits. He tried a smile while adjusting the bomb strapped to his neck.

""Well, One, we gonna have a lot of fun today. Can you start us off with a pun?""

The contestant swallowed hard, even shifting the bomb, then put on a forced smile.

""Whatever you said, man!"" he yelled jovially. 

Some of the audience gave him pity applause.

""Oh, you meant like my name?"" Stedman said, giving a sympathetic look to the camera. ""Said man. Stedman. I'm sorry, son, but for a one pun I gotta shun you, and say... you're done!"" He flipped a thumbs down to the camera as the poor kid screamed in terror. A screen fell over him, quieting his screams of another chance and the audience went silent to listen to the muffled explosion of the neck strap.

*Pop.*

The audience roared their approval as blood pooled up under the screen.

""Ooooh, that was a much better crowd reaction! Let's see how our other contestants do!"" he strided over to the District 2 contestant who was a girl with a huge clown nose and said,

""How we doing today?"" he asked.

Contestant 2 didn't miss a beat.

""Better than old One over there."" Some 'ooohs' in the crowd showed their support for this.

""Yeah, looks like you got a good head on your shoulders.""

""I'm a pretty calm person, it takes a lot for me to lose my head,"" and she spun around her neck strap for emphasis. The crowd was eating it up.

""Can I get your name, miss?""

""Sorry, I'm not on first name basis with any losers, you gotta beat me to know."" She was pushing it. Maybe a little too far.

""Did you just call me a loser?"" Stedman asked, face changing hues.

The girl lost her composure in an instant.

""Sorry, I didn't--"" she clamped her hand over her mouth.

""DID YOU JUST SAY SORRY?"" Stedman screamed to the audience with a laugh as they all held thumbs-down his way. ""What's rule number one of Whose Life?""

She remained frozen, tears welling up in her eyes, so he turned to the audience and opened his arms, welcoming them to answer.

""What the rule?""

""Never apologize for a joke!"" 

*Too Late to Apologize* blared over the speakers as the screen came down over her. She didn't move at all as it fell. The music paused for a second so everyone could hear the *pop* then continued as the crowd screamed in enjoyment. 

He came to me next, stroking my costume's loin tail as he walked around me.

""What do they call you?"" he purred.

I opened my mouth and went against my instincts.

""Ugly,"" I said, with dejection in my voice, turning my head down. Stedman guffawed as the crowd applauded madly at the one word. I got 10 points on screen.

""Wow, don't want to go into that. What do your friends call you, then?"" 

I rolled with it.

""I thought we already went over this."" I replied, keeping the defeatist tone in my voice. Another 10 points. The crowd ate it up, but I saw Stedman's mouth twitch. I was pushing it.

""What does dear old mum call you? Your name, honey?""

""Hera.""

""Good to know you, Ugly. I look forward to knowing you a little more in a bit,"" he walked to the next contestant. 

I was about to make another self-depreciating joke about how I'd never heard a guy say that before, but stopped myself. I can't do any one joke too long or the audience gets over it. Stedman was already on my side. I was gonna keep it that way.

"[WP] Everyone is born with a superpower, but the strength of that superpower is determined by how late in the year someone was born. Two twins are born on New Years Eve and New Years Day respectively.",laxnut90,"""Do you mind?"" Ash said, gesturing to his feet, which hovered slightly off the ground. ""It's just that I met a cute flyer girl, and she wants--""

""Nah, go ahead."" Lee (their parents were too cutesy for anyone's good) waved his twin brother off. ""You know I'd be right behind you.""

""I'll see you!"" Ash shot up into the air, vanishing into the swarm of other levitators while Lee craned his neck, trying to peer over the crowd on the ground for a glimpse of this girl. Most of the time, it wasn't bad--he usually passed himself off as a density-increaser, an almost completely impractical power, so no one ever called him on it. But it sucked when Ash went flying without him. Especially with a cute girl.

Lee's wristlet (he refused to use the term ""smartwatch"", damn it, and he'd invented it first) beeped at him. Distress call on the other end of the concert ground; it had been activated nine times in the past thirty seconds. He hesitated a moment, then tapped the screen, on the blue button labelled ""Ash"". It would automatically text his brother, ""Running errands,"" their personal euphemism.

From his backpack, he pulled a folded-down thing that looked like a miniature skateboard, with straps to hold his feet on. By concentrating, he could hover an inch or two above the ground, just enough room to eliminate friction for the hoverboard. The crowd of concert-goers broke and seamlessly merged around him, paying Lee no more attention than a river would a rock in the riverbed. He inhaled, exhaled, floated into the air, and zoomed across the grounds.

The concert had a system of cheap wristbands that consisted of a button and a tracker. After some incidents in previous years, the Safe-T Bands were now mandatory, although an entire cult had grown around making fun of the tacky brand name. Lee's slightly-unauthorized link into the computer network alerted him whenever one of the distress buttons was pressed more than three times in succession (a good indicator of severe distress), and his wristlet navigated him to where the tracker was. There were security staff, but they were spread thin, and his data showed it took an average of seven minutes for them to reach any single distressed tracker. This, to make it worse, was in a remote section of the grounds used for loading and unloading.

""Hello?"" he said, leaning into the turn as he skidded around a corner to where his wristlet said the tracker was. Two men turned to face him: one, pinned against the brick wall, had weak flames flickering at the tips of his fingers. Born very late in the year. The other was standing on tell-tale concrete, cracked and almost beginning to sag underneath his feet; Lee regretted saying anything disparaging about density-increasers.

""Uh, sir--""

""Get lost, kid,"" Mr. Dense said.

""What are you doing?"" he pressed. ""Because that doesn't look like it's completely legal, you know? And while I agree that evil flamethrowers can be kind of terrifying, it's probably not justified to beat a decent-looking guy up just for that.""

""Help! I'm being robb--"" the flamethrower began, but Mr. Dense loomed ominously, concrete sinking even more, and he shut up.

Lee gently drifted his hoverboard down until the wheels rested on the ground (it was also a functioning skateboard, he was very proud of that). From one pocket, he pulled a small black rectangle about the size of a deck of cards, with a blue arrow on the top that he surreptitiously made sure was facing Mr. Dense. ""I really think you should reconsider--"" and then he interrupted himself to fire the mini-Taser at the man, who dropped like a rock, if rocks twitched slightly.

Lee grinned. No one ever expected the attack to come during *his* monologue.

""You okay there?"" he called.

""Yeah?"" the flamethrower squeaked, voice cracking. It had probably been a traumatic day.

""You should stay here until security locates your tracker, and they'll take him away,"" Lee said, nodding at the prone form of Mr. Dense as he floated back up.

""Okay,"" the flamethrower said, eyes still very wide. ""Wait, you aren't security?""

""Nah. I gotta go, though, I have a band to catch and a jetpack to finish designing. Promised my brother someday I'd go flying with him.""",JaybirdFarley

"[WP] Everyone is born with a superpower, but the strength of that superpower is determined by how late in the year someone was born.

One of the main things that resulted in this was everyone being very friendly towards one another when meeting eachother for the first time. Very polite and genuine interactions. Why? Because you didn't know the other persons birthday yet, so you didn't know how strong their power was and more importantly, if it was stronger than yours or not.

While being friendly on the outside, both parties would secretly try to discover what day the other party was born on, whilst also keeping their own birthday a secret. Its simple enough to understand really. As long as your birthday is unknown, the other person has to be cautious because there is still the risk that your birthday falls on a later day than theirs. Untill you know exactly how strong someone is, you're very carefull in making sure you don't offend or harm them in any way.

It was a threat that hung above your head untill you discovered what their birthday was, in which case one of two things happened. If theirs is before yours, great. You're stronger than them, and you can pretty much treat them like garbage. Or option B, your birthday comes first, in which case, tough luck, you're probably the one to be treated like garbage unless of course they havent figured out your birthday yet.

Even then, there was still the risk of the person who was born on the first of January to have a friend, brother, parent who was born in half December so its still not a foolproof method.

Now that I've explained all this you can probably understand why I was enormly confused when the young man in front of me introduced himself as Fred, born on the first of January. I was flabbergasted. I'm far from lateborn myself (5th of May, if you were wondering) but this guy had literally the weakest possible power and he was very forward about it.

I introduced myself as well. Didnt mention my own birthday: the young man might be a weakling but he could have been sent by someone who holds a grudge against me that doesn't know my birthday yet. Wouldnt be the first time someone had employed spies or worse to discover a birthday.

""I'm sorry for asking, but why are you so upfront about your birthday? You're at a point in life where you should know the risk and danger that comes from people knowing your birthday, so why tell me, someone you just met? I could have very bad intentions and now I know that you are the complete opposite of a threat to me.""

He smiled. 'Well funny thing. I'm part of a twin you see, we were born just a few minutes apart. My older brother, George, was born just before me on new years eve.'

For the second time since meeting him I was shocked. He had one of the weakest possible powers but his twin brother apparently had the strongest one possible. There was much discussion on wether or not the hour at which you were born had an influence on power level or if it was just the day but his brother was undoubtedly one of the most powerfull people in the planet if what he said was true.

And then, right when I was about to ask him more about this brother, I saw him. A red haired boy casually walking towards us. Completely identical to the boy already sitting in front of me. The twin brother he spoke off. I recovered a bit and wanted to ask Fred if he knew that he was in a very dangerous position. If somebody wanted to exert pressure on his brother all they would have to do was kidnap and threaten his much weaker little brother, but I was interrupted.

""Hey George, who's the new friend?"" He walked up to me and extended his hand for a handshake. I was too confused to realize it so he just awkardly dropped his hand. "" I see you've met my older brother George, I'm Fred"" he said. I looked to him and back to the other one. He said his name was Fred, but now the other one claimed to be Fred.

And suddenly it clicked. The reason he could just go around and tell people his birthday willy nilly, and then casually mention that his twin brother who happened to look identical was born just before him. Its ok to tell people that you are the weakest person on the planet if the most powerfull person on the planet looks just like you. ",MisterDerptastic

"[WP] Everyone is born with a superpower, but the strength of that superpower is determined by how late in the year someone was born. Two twins are born on New Years Eve and New Years Day respectively.",laxnut90,"""Hey there"" I shouted, as my two friends Alice and Daren approached. They didn't look anything special but Daren was perhaps the most powerful person on the planet. He stood about six feet tall with black slicked back hair and piercing grey eyes. His younger sister (not much younger, they were born mere minutes apart) was by contrast rather short, probably about five feet high with beautiful brown hair that bounced on her shoulders and warm amber eyes. In this world, each person is born with some kind of superpower and the closer you are born to the new year, the more powerful your power is. For me, I was born is february so my power to control metal isn't that strong, but I use it more for mechanical purposes to help me build circuitry, I'm really into A.I. you see and being able to manipulate metallic lattices on an atomic scale, while not visually stunning, lets me create computers vastly more complex than what has been built yet. You see someone can be as powerful as they like, it all depends on what you do with the power you are given that makes you into who you are.

Daren is... scary. With a single glance he can captivate anyone that he sees, completely overwhelming their ego and essentially putting them into a trance. Anything he wants is his so long as he wills it. I've known the twins since we were children and so I can tell if he is controlling someone. He doesn't ever use it on me or his sister though. I actually exist within a computer structure as a self-aware android. When I was 18 I'd already created the groundwork for sentience transfer between humans and.. hardware. I received a grant from the government for an experiment to transfer my own mind into an artificial body for 10 years to test the effectiveness of the program. This means that his powers don't work on me. For the most part he refrains from using it at all. He says he doesn't like how it feels, being able to control everyone around him makes them feel like lifeless shells, as if he is the only creature in existence. Whenever he uses it on someone his potential empathy for them is ruined because he realizes that we are basically just computers after all. 

While Daren was cold and calculating, Alice was extremely empathetic. She could sense other's emotions on a subconscious level and always knew what to say to cheer you up. She couldn't really do anything to anyone, she could only talk to them. I don't think she has a mean bone in her body. I remember this one time in high school when we were eating in the cafeteria. The lunch ladies had served some nasty beef stroganoff and a girl jealous of Alice had told her boyfriend (a low power telekinetic user) to dump the food on Alice's head. Alice eyes started glazing over as tears welled up and Daren stood up on the spot. The entire room went quiet as an aura swept around taking over every classroom. The only people unaffected were me, Alice, and the girl and her boyfriend. In one horrifying moment everyone turned to look directly at the boyfriend and the realization sunk in that everyone's eyes had turned grey. Not only could Daren control others, but he could unify other people's powers in a way that multiplied their effectiveness. By combining the telekenetics he lifted everything in the room as if gravity itself had ceased. By combining the pyros we could see great fires dancing careless around the two soon to consume them. Daren wanted them dead, and he honestly would have just let them die had Alice not touched his arm. In that moment everything returned to normal and I found out what her actual power was. While Daren could control anyone he wanted, Alice was the only one who could influence him.",convoy465

[WP] Your roommate is 2nd most powerful superhero in the world and he will not shut up about it. He does not yet know that you are the 1st.,laxnut90,"A flash of light, I open my eyes again. Back in my apartment. The lights are all back on, Loyalty must have turned them on while in my body. I look over to my left, there's a cup of Earl Grey tea on the end table. Walking towards the window to our apartment, I can see a bright light coming from the docks. The light patrolled back and forth for a few minutes before flying out of sight. Sighing, I return to the TV. 

The news channel was still on from earlier. I noticed that the anchorman had been changed and take out my phone to check the time. 1:00 AM. Long night. I notice the apartment filling with light and turn towards the balcony. Toby lands on the balcony and turns off his battle glare, once inside he takes off his helmet.

""He looks shaken"" a voice says inside my head. 

""Excellent"" one says

""Nice work"" from another

I tried to ignore them to the best of my ability. I turn my attention outwards again, to my roommate. He stays silent, staring at his helmet. I decided to speak first,

""What happened? News hasn't gotten there yet."" 

He lets out a long sigh and looks to the ceiling.

""You weren't able to capture Machiavelli's fragment?"" I continue, deciding that playing ignorant is the best course of action to both avoid detection from Nova and help comfort my friend.

""No. I... couldn't capture it. Fuck!"" He slams the counter extending from the kitchen. His eyes flare, then subside. We are quiet for a time. ""...he, Machiavelli, he knew my identity. He threatened your life as well. Just because I haven't been careful enough. You always complain someone will see me enter the apartment, but I bend my light when I enter. It looks like I flew by the building every time.""

Shit. I was thrown off by this. He had actually been covering his tracks? His next question will be then-

""Godammit! How did he find out?!"" The shadows in the room become more pronounced as Toby begins to glow. 

Loyalty's voice sounds in my head, he offers to assist if a fight breaks out.

""Machiavelli has a fragment that can read minds..."" I began, but Toby continues.

""That fragment has a range limit! And even then, the fragment is in New York City, not here. I haven't even fought it yet, we've just come up with counter strategies together."" 

I remain silent. One thing I've been doing with Toby is making counter strategies against my fragments. I justify my research on other heroes and villains by claiming I'm a huge nerd for this stuff. Toby asked for my help and I saw an opportunity to work a fail safe into every encounter with him as Nova. The walls were our idea to deal with Loyalty's time stopping skills, luckily, he still hasn't figured out how the fragment is escaping.

""Fuck I'm Tired, I can hardly think."" With that, he clenched his fists and marched into his room. I could hear a pillow being blasted into bits by an energy blast from behind the door.

Damn. That didn't go very well at all. I didn't think ahead enough when making my threat. 

""But it accomplished the same goal."" A voice whispered, Sociality, the fragment calls itself. ""Better to be feared than loved, in your namesake's own words."" 

Sociality is a split personality fragment that switches from a refined, polite, manipulative side (who goes by Nobis); to a friendly, destructive, wild side (who goes by Streeter). The personality switch comes with a powerset swap. One controls Ice, and uses a rapier that can project ice nearly a mile away. The other controls fire, and possesses a mechanical arm with more firepower than a modern tank. They can switch instantly and on command. Their powers work surprisingly well together, their personalities; however, do not.

""But the original Machiavelli also stated that a ruler should avoid being hated at all costs."" I retorted.

""He was referring to the ruler's subjects, for international affairs, the ruler must follow the allegory of the fox and the lion."" 

Sinking down onto the couch, defeated, I say

 ""This still isn't what I wanted."" 

Silence. The fragment seems to have left the conversation. I stand up and walk to my room. I crash onto my bed and turn to the nightstand. There is a picture of my younger sister and I at a carnival. 

I smile,

""Maybe I should visit the hospital tomorrow.""

*Sorry this took longer than expected! I had a serious case of writer's block towards the end.* 

*I'm happy with this now, and will try to have the last part out by tomorrow. I think I'll continue to expand on this world (and hopefully on Machiavelli's life) more in a subreddit for my writing prompts responses.*

Basically, the idea is that whenever I see a writing prompt that can work with my world, I'll try to do a spinoff story set in the world for the prompt.

I give a nod to the nurse in response and enter the room. My sister was in her wheelchair by the window, intently reading a comic book. She turns, hearing the door open. A smile quickly spreads across her face. 

""Chris!"" She exclaimed.

""Hey Kate.""

""Did you bring any presents?"" 

""Yeah. You wanted a Victory Girl figurine right? Well, I got my roommate to pull some strings for me, and I got it"" I said, proudly pulling the twelve inch statuette of Victory Girl and her electric blue power suit out of my bag. Her jaw dropped in awe. I then pointed at it's base and grinned. ""And it's signed by her.""

""Oh my god thank you thank you thank you!"" She squealed in excitement. 

I watched in silence as she greedily took in the level of detail that the figure was crafted with.

""Hey, so how's physical therapy going?""

She turned to me and said ""meh, not amazingly. Doctors are still saying that I can't walk. But I'm now able to move my wheelchair on my own."" A grin appeared across her face. ""Check it out!"" She exclaimed as she sped across the room and spun into a stop. She was slow on the brakes and ended up hitting a wall. ""Ack.""

I smile ""you've been practicing."" 

""Yeah.""

""Hey, when do they think you can leave the hospital?"" 

""They're hoping it will be only about a few months more. Then I'll go back to living with Mom and Dad."" 

""That's great! After all these years, you can get back into normal life.""

""Yeah, can't wait.""

A silence follows. It is broken by a fractured, echoing voice within my head.

""WhO's tHis? YOur giRlfrienD?""

Fuck off Insanity, I think to myself.

""Oh, YouR siSter? ShE's cUte.""

I repeat my last thought and try to tune his voice out. 

""Damn."" I say, mostly to myself, ""it's been six years since it happened.""

I began to think back. It was 6 years ago. I was 15 years old, my sister was 10. I was walking my sister home from school when we were suddenly pulled into an alleyway by three large men. They were kidnapping us for ransom. Our family was a fairly wealthy family in our city, but no one had ever come after us for this before. We managed to escape the car when they stopped on the interstate for a piss break. We got maybe one hundred meters before they got into the cezcar and drove after us. Kate was hit by the car as they drove by. 

At that moment, my powers were activated. Reality was bent to my will, a windstorm whipped up around me, and a fragment of my imagination and will began forming behind me. The men shot me twice in the chest, but the third shot was intercepted by a ceramic arm. The fragment in front of me was more puppet than human. The arm exploded into shards and sand. The fragment threw a mannequin onto the ground in front of it. The mannequin rose, and dashed forth, it's movements jerky and unnatural, like it's master. The men unloaded their rounds into the puppet, but it kept running forwards, scythes springing from it's arms. One of the men was smart enough to run to the side, the other two stood their ground and kept shooting. The puppet reached them. The puppet blocked my view, but I could tell that the men who stayed were turned into mincemeat.

""Die, freak!"" The one that escaped shouted. He shot my fragment twice in the head. My fragment fell before me, a quarter of his skull shattered by the bullets. The man approached me, bloodlust radiating from him. ""You're fucking dead you-"" but he is pulled to the ground by a ceramic hand. A garrote encircles his neck and it all ends. The fragment stands up, sand and shards of ceramic flying through the air to fill in the gaps of his head. It turns towards me, and extends a hand. It opens it's mouth to speak. It's voice is hollow and echoing.

""HeLlo, hOst. YoU may CalL me Insanity.""

The next months were a blur. I remember lawyers, a hospital, and my worried parents. I found out that my sister had broken her spine and would likely never walk again since healers can't fix the nervous system. I found out that I would have difficulty exercising and have breathing problems for the rest of my life. 

But back to the present.

""Hey bro?"" 

I shake myself out of the flashback and train my attention on my sister. She continues,

""You've been kind of out of it today. You okay?""

I smile back, ""I'm fine, really, tired is all.""

She frowns, but nods and seems to accept the answer. I spend the rest of the afternoon keeping my sister company until visiting hours end.

I admit, that Alanis Morissette song basically ruined any possibility of me actually knowing what that word means.

Haversham opens the door.  ""Your 10 o'clock is here,"" she reports.

""Remind me.""

""High General Wilhelm Vanderbilt""

""Show him in.""

He's a big fellow.  Like, once he used to be the size of a goddamn truck and made out of muscle, and now he's not gone to seed but still he's past his physical peak.  It's like seeing a wrestler way past their prime but still fit.  Kinda sad, but you still feel like you're looking at somebody more fit right now than you have ever or will ever be.

""General!  Good to see you.  How can I help?""

""Remember those plasma rifles you got shipped to us last week?""

""Yes I do, three crates of five apiece I think it was?  That was a sample of course, how did you like them?""

""Well they hit like damned hammers and they cause one hell of an explosion.  My tech boys went through the manuals you sent, is it true that blast can actually be *shaped*?""

""Absolutely, and I have a few pre-set software templates for them with useful shapes in them, your soldiers could select exactly what they need in a second or so from their HUD once these things are networked into their gearnet.  I can certainly provide you the licenses for that software of course.""

""Now, can you turn that explosive blast down at all?  We're looking at a lot of urban combat coming up in the future, close quarters stuff.  Hi-ex doesn't play too nice there.""

Urban combat.  That's noteworthy.

""Absolutely, and I might be able to get you some ray shielding too.  Rumor on the street is that the Psychos are testing out something more precise than the usual fireballs.""

""I had heard that, good to hear you might be able to defend against it.  Well I'll get my tech-guys on the horn with you to work out the specifics for that software, but from what I've seen already I'm going to green-light an order for 100 crates of these things, and I'll get the licenses to go with, and whatever else is necessary to tie these things into the gearnet.""

That's gear for 4 companies, 5 squads of 20 apiece, for six months.  That's noteworthy.

""Absolutely wonderful, it's a pleasure to do business with you sir,"" I stand and extend my hand to shake with the General, ""and Ms. Haversham will have the paperwork sent over to your legal teams right away, standard contract of course, nothing you haven't seen before.""

""Wonderful, they'll give it the cursory once-over and should be able to deliver it back by close of business tomorrow, with payment in our intermediary account 24 hours after that.""

He leaves.  I take lunch, make some notes, arrange shipping from my warehouses for some product, and read up on what the Psychos have been fielding lately.  Haversham opens my door again.

""Your 2 o'clock is here""

""Remind me.""

""Grand Sorcerer Nanukut Vishaan""

I stand up.

""Thank you, show him in.""

This guy is taller than almost anybody I've seen, nearly seven foot, and rail skinny.  He wears a three piece suit minus the jacket, with a chain indicating a pocketwatch, and is completely bald.  Like, Lex Luthor bald.  He's got no eyebrows either, and I've noticed there's no hair on the back of his hands or his knuckles either.

I bow deeply as I greet him.

""An honor to have you in my office, Grand Sorcerer.""

""Thank you, Mr. Penn.""

""How can I help?""

""We are running low on the Gloves of Fire, and I would like to procure more.  I have another matter I must discuss with you after that business as well.""

""Of course sir, more of the gloves can be provided quite quickly.  If I might note, sir, this seems a bit early given the size of the last order.""

""We expect to deploy and utilize the gloves more widely and frequently given recent observations.""

""Oh?""

""Yes.  Our enemies, the Technocrats, have tested a device which casts a ball of fire which explodes upon impact with a solid object, be it man, beast, machine, or building.""

They've come upon that sample I sent to the General, and they're anticipating greater recruitment.  That's noteworthy.

""Excellent, Ms. Haversham will have the same contract as previously ready for your signature in the foyer and the shipping can indeed be expedited if need be, the fee is quite modest.""

""Most excellent.  Before I sign that, I have another matter to discuss with you.  I am interested in a cloak of invisibility for certain of my men.  They will need this to work in a variety of environments.""

""Does that include within the bounds of a city?""

""Possibly, although our clerics and spies think it unlikely.""

That's very noteworthy.

""Hmm.  If I might offer my opinion, I would say better safe than sorry.  A spell of invisibility is simple enough when one only needs to blend into what nature offers, the sand of a desert or the underbrush of a forest, but to blend into what isn't natural such as an alleyway or a city, it takes more adaptability and intelligence for a spell to accomplish.  More complex magic.  A little bit harder to acquire, but more versatile if you can.  And of course sir, I can.""

""For a price.""

He's cagey.  Close it.

""For a sum of money far lesser than the cost of the lives you might lose with a bad cloak if the Technocrats attack you in a city.""

""Do you know something my spies and clerics do not?""

""I have my ear to different ground than they do.  I have contacts they don't, and can't have.  All because I work in a different sector of our industry.""

He bristles a little bit at the idea of me knowing more than him, but he recognizes free intel when he sees it.  You don't get to be where he is without knowing that associates aren't always friends.

He pauses and regards me for a moment.

""Perhaps that is wise then.  Yes, the urban option.  Have a sampling sent over, I'll sign Ms. Haversham's contract for that too.""

I beam.

""Wonderful.  Anything else then?""

""In light of what you've just told me, I wonder if maybe I should place a full order of that wand you showed me which casts a ray of heat.""

We arrange the details, but I've already checked out by then.  Recently, Technocrat orbital platforms have been seen shifting their orbits slightly, and the various online forums that track such things (mostly comprised of amateur astronomers armed with a telescope and a GPS-enabled smartphone) have theorized that they're aiming for maximum time over Prague, which is theorized to be the Psychomancer's base of operations by a different set of online forums (these mostly comprised of psychomancy-sensitive people noting teleportations they detect, their location, and what time they detected them).

I start looking up publicly-traded companies with headquarters or major regional offices in Prague, and the rules for short-selling in the European markets.",ferlessleedr

Some camps of people claim using ""said"" is horrible and shows lazy/sloppy/novice writing and should be avoided. Other camps say using ""said"" is acceptable because total avoidance can be just as bad when you go through excessive literary contortions to indicate who is speaking. For example:

""Holy shit!"" exclaimed the demonic personification of all that was unholy. ""I think I just had my first benevolent thought."" the ruler of hell mouthed. ""It was awful"" winced the fallen angel.

Now it's not so much as ""said"" itself bothers me, it's the camps of people around it that can't agree on a rule.

"[WP] At some point in your story, a Dragon must die.",smugarol,"At times, a single dot in the sky can catch your awareness. An occurrence you may well have never seen, leaps to the forefront to imprison your attention. It is our nature to turn away. To avoid giving the small dot the attention it demands. To gather ourselves up into the mundane and the daily habits we use to distract ourselves. And the dot grows. We push it out of our head, knowing inside that we are failing. Knowing that we must look or, in time, we will wish we had, long ago. We look away. We scold ourselves in reminiscence of the times we should have looked. And the dot grows. 

It grows until it can no longer be ignored. Blotting out the sun with its size. Forcing us to look. Our attention is stolen and as we shade our eyes to gaze upward we see the true form this single dot in the sky has taken. We recognize its shape and meaning. We see the power we have given it, the power it wields over us and how strong it has grown as we looked away. We curse the great beast for threatening the story we tell ourselves. For falling from the sky, visible to all those who care to see. 

Standing before you now; this beast you brought to life. The great shadow you fed and nourished and taught to never care for you. The dragon whose chains you wear. Shackles that have held you in place all your life. 

Your tomorrow will be the same as your today if you cannot overcome the love you feel for this creature you so deeply despise. This love, born of company over so many years, seems all you have, but you know there is no truth there. Your story has been one of your own making and will continue to be. 

You know what you must do and you turn and begin walking away. You know that so long as it is not called for or fed, it will not move. The further it is left behind, the less of your attention will be lost on it. Soon it will be just a single dot in the distance hardly worth attention.

"[WP] At some point in your story, a Dragon must die.",smugarol,"There once was a dragon,
He was brave and wise,
He granted them protection,
But they could not protect him
From what had begun.

Living as long as he did,
He spent much time under the sun.
As a result, what followed
Was cancer, a plague of paragons.

The tumor inflated,
Bold and true,
Until it was the size of three heads.
It was at this point he had bid the humans adieu
To lay to rest in his eternal bed.

"[WP] At some point in your story, a Dragon must die.",smugarol,"To a point. I think its about the relationship we have with the dragon. The hesitations and insecurities we live with that are of our own making or drilled into us from the outside. We get to know these shadows and they become part of who we are. 

There are times in our lives when we discover we must leave a part of us behind. It may be a habit or an insecurity or a frightened child we have carried inside us for so long that walking away becomes an act of abandonment. But it gets better.

[IP] What wonderful things we can do with trash.,the_sme2,"Nancy had been off the grid for too long. That's what her daughter and new son in law said anyways. They'd been over for breakfast this morning to share pamphlets of nice condominiums for her to be locked away in; some authorities kept calling her daughter about selling Nancy's little plot of land in the center of a forest. They were dying to build another water park or something more audacious if there was anything worse than plastic tubes spilling the Earth's blood in the name of fleeting joy.

Nancy's shaw covered two bags of recycled goods. Monday through Thursday Nancy went around the parks and streets by the forest and collected any material that wasn't natural and stuffed it into her bags. No one ever questioned what she did with it all- they didn't care. If it was out of sight that was all that mattered. The people just waste and waste- do they have any idea how many birds they kill with each piece of lumber in their house or the amount of trees that are sprayed down like a prison inmate just so they can have that fake banana for breakfast because they are on their silly juicing diet? Nancy did. Well, she didn't have exact numbers but she knew- she knew it was bad. 

She knew it was her mission too. So she collected the trash. She nailed old shoes to trees and used them as birdfeeders. She took old cups and filled them with dirt and seeds to help little saplings start their lives. Water bottles left for the rain to fill and buried partly into the ground to keep trees and flowers hydrated in the summer; it was only right considering bottles were a leading pollutant that started the warming.

No, Nancy's daughter had no idea what was going on despite Nancy's best efforts. Nancy pulled out another shoe and slowly tapped a nail into the tree, careful for it not to get too deep. She was shoving it into an old growth long since recessed, once it was firmly up there she packed up a handful of dirt and drizzled it into the shoe. She took a package of sunflower seeds and another packet of bird seed and layered the shoe. Hopefully, something beautiful would come to see her today, right on this shoe.

Joan had nothing to do with the car, but she was definitely there when it happened.  Cheryl's hands trembled from the frustration.  Her fore finger and thumb came to pinch the bridged of her nose as she took a deep breath.

""I want you two to step me through what the hell happened to my damn car,"" she softly mumbled.  I looked over at Joan who wore a white beanie and a baggy green jacket, her blonde hair pouring out of that cute beanie.  How could I have brought her into this mess?  How could I have brought myself into this mess?  Fury was written on Cheryl's face but she was willing to listen.  

""So Jake from across the street got a hold of your car.  I knew that he stole it, that's just the kind of guy he is, so you should really blame him,"" I softly said before Joan chimed in.

""To be fair, anyone would have used a grenade to stop a criminal,"" I said with a slight pout.

""And where did you get a grenade from!?"" Cheryl cried out, going back to pacing.

""I found it in your back yard.  You should be thanking me!  What if that thing took out your yard!?"" I said, trying to get reason through to that angry woman's head.

""SO YOU THOUGHT TAKING OUT MY CAR WAS A BETTER IDEA!?"" she screamed.  I stood up from the couch and walked up to Cheryl.

""I. Panicked.  After Jake ran away when the grenade had gone off and landed the car in your driveway was when I realized I had a dentist appointment at 1.

Benjamin was a college boy, living in a dorm. One night after a session of summoning ghosts in the library with his friends, he finds himself with ghostly super powers. He could turn invisible and pass through everything, as well as turning other objects invisible with his touch. After the period of figuring out his powers passed, he decided to have some fun with them by walking around the dorm and spy other rooms, because he is still a boy with invisibility powers. He carried a GoPro attached to his head. Through this method, he made a quite big fan base to himself on Internet with a nice ad revenue on a porn site that focused on public nudity. To be sure that no one would recognize him on his videos, he would wear all black and a classic vigilante mask on his faceThe internet didn't have to know about his powers, and lots of people speculated that all of his videos were staged. He blurs people's faces, but not their action. A few big examples of his work were finding two girls making out in the school's gym showers late at night, and another one where he taped a couple getting it on in their room.

While floating around the building, he found a room that might interest him and his audience. He passed through a door with 2 names attached to a house image; Stella and Becky. Ben knew the names from living in the same building, but they were never his friends. Becky was on her computer, chatting with people. She has curly brown hair and big chest that was struggling to fit into her white tank top. The table where her laptop is placed covers the whole side of a wall with windows that is viewing the forest from top. Their beds are placed next to the opposite walls to each other. Stella is in her bed, probably sleeping. Her face and whole body was under the bed sheets except her legs. Stella was laying in bed with his legs making a triangle on the sheets.

 The boy walked closer to Becky, getting some cleavage shot that his viewers might enjoy. After some time, he turns around to walk to the other side of the room and puts his bed through their drawers. Finds a few good looking underwear and TOYS. He smiled and threw a look at Stella. Her blanket was still over her head, covering every part of her body. He left  whatever he found in the drawers back to their respectable places and walk back to Stella's bed. Ben put his head between Stella's legs. To his surprise, Stella was still up and on her phone. Her legs were open, which allowed the camera to have a good view on her. Stella was shorter than Becky, but in a somewhat thinner body. She had blue eyes, and long blonde hair. She was wearing brown pyjamas with yellow squares drawn on every few inches. A silver cross hanging between her breasts shined with the phone light. Benjamin moved his hand between her open legs, towards her chest. 

Stella turned her head away from the phone to look at him . ""WHAT THE FUCK!"" she yelled.",HydraVea

I had it since I was in 4th grade. It was roughly rectangle-shaped and opened like a sketch pad, with two pieces of plastic hinged together at the top. The back “page” held the actual reflective mirror, even though I call the whole thing a mirror. The front “cover” of the mirror was baby yellow with a grass green sticker of a star on it. The sticker had a picture of an angel dipping down, with hands reaching toward a small yellow flower. The cover also had a clam-shaped “handle” for the hand to lift up the cover to see the actual reflective mirror. The back of the mirror was translucently white with the real mirror embedded in it. Due to me repeatedly touching that reflective part, there were finger prints and smears on it. Overall, the whole mirror showed signs of use, with scratches and eraser sheddings stuck in the surface of the plastic. ",banana_bandanna
"[WP] Pick up an object near you, and describe it in intricate detail.

In fact, all the markings on the bottom, excluding the FCC wireless information sticker, were eroding away. So were the friction-reducing pads, but they still worked just fine.

The sides of the mouse were black, and made of either once-smooth but now scuffed plastic, or of rubber patterned with little ovals that gave a fish-scale appearance. Both the plastic and the rubber were coated with the grease off of a man's hand.

The top of the mouse was red plastic, though it had seen better days. In several places, the red coating had chipped, revealing a dark gray, almost black, plastic underneath. The largest of those chipped areas looked like either a chihuahua with no legs and a head larger than its body, or a crude rendition of that internet cancer known as ""dickbutt.""

Near the offending chipped plastic was a busted LED indicator. Once upon a time, it glowed green when the mouse was powered on, but it no longer did. Directly above the busted light was the seam between the two buttons, and further still was the scroll wheel. Patterned with the same ovals as the side rubber, the wear on and curve of the wheel made it look more like alligator scales instead of fish scales.

On the buttons to either side, and partially hidden by how the light reflected off the curved plastic, where two little, black symbols, &lt; and &gt;, on the left and right buttons respectively. And further outward still were the scuffs of general wear and tear.

The mouse's little dongle, barely even big enough to fit in the USB drive of the laptop, was, by contrast, in pristine condition. No scuffs or scratches marred the tiny, black, plastic surface of the dongle's exterior. Despite being the same age as the mouse, it had clearly taken less damage that its partner.",wille179

The Russians invaded the middle east, the EU took over many parts of Africa. The US invaded Mexico, Cuba, and other small Latin American countries.

The advisors who’d boarded Air Force One with him were currently scurrying around, trying to ascertain just what had happened.  The president just waited for the inevitable phone call. They’d both bluffed, and they’d both called that bluff.


Nuclear weapons were real. It was basic physics after all. Hiroshima and Nagasaki had been destroyed, nuclear tests had taken place and at first the bombs were real. Sometime in the middle of the seventies though high ranking people on both sides had realized some things. First off, actual nuclear war was too awful to contemplate. No one in their right mind would actually pull the trigger on them. Second, the threat of a bomb was as good as a real bomb, better actually. The threat of a nuke could quell an enemy more effectively than one actually detonating. It was just a bonus that the fear of nukes motivated the civilian populations like it did. So why bother making real nukes? They were expensive and if something accidentally happened… well that didn’t bear thinking about. So for the last thirty years thousands of nuclear “weapons” had been deployed, paraded around, and trained with, and the only thing at their cores were lead weights. Oh, there were a few nukes squirreled away, a few bombs, some missiles, even a torpedo or two, but they didn’t even total a hundred and were only really kept around in case of aliens or asteroids or if North Korea finally just got that damn annoying.

Current advisory is to find nearest fueling station,"" the onboard AI spoke over the light hum of the engine, ""At current fuel depletion rate, you will reach the fueling station in ONE HUNDRED AND NINETEEN--""

""Disable proximity alerts from this moment onward,"" I coughed, ""Authorization code; Foxtrot-One-Four.""

""Authorization code accepted,"" the voice soothed me these days, the faint whisper of a women long past her life, ""proximity alerts now disabled.""

The engines hummed again, I could feel them against the chair, the slight vibration as the ship pushed in the last fuel reserves. My last jump landed me in some quadrant a few lightyears from the nearest civilized outpost, another ten lightyears from a civilized planet. Although, the things I *did* get to see in this quadrant were quite beautiful.

Eriandus II has some of the biggest, and best, waterfalls I have ever seen. My flyby of that planet was well-worth the last jump. That old smuggler from three months sure wasn't lying in that regard.

""Martha,"" I leaned forward and stared into the vastness of space. My fuel clock was at an end, and I knew, so was my own biological one. ""Open a new audio journal.""

""Designation Required.""

""*Final Goodbye*.""

""Recording now...""

I took a few deep breaths, I had done this a hundred times in my twelve-month journey. Documenting my trips from planet to planet, but this one, it seemed so hard just to get the first few words out. ""Well, the fuel is finally at an end."" I chuckled, ""almost twelve months to the day. Just like the smuggler said.""

I shrugged, ""No sense in putting it off now. I mean who wants to hear a terminally ill guy at the end of his life talk about it all? I don't have some profound message from my travels, or even a quote that I found. No.""

I took a deep sigh, knowing full well that the audio would pick it up, ""No, I have nothing to say anymore. I've seen the worlds I've wanted, said goodbye to the ones I loved, and did what any sensible man would do."" I laughed, ""I flew away in a goddamned space shuttle.""

I flipped a few switches, dimming the interior of my cabin to blackness. Only the silent hum of the engine and the dim light of the space shuttle controls could be seen. ""I will say this, it's one of the most luxurious ships I've ever been in."" I leaned back in the seat, ""Martha, cool the cabin. I think I'm going to sleep now.""

""Cooling the cabin will result in a sharp drop and potentially bring it to leth--""

""Override code, Foxtrot-One-Four-Alpha.""

""Accepted. Goodnight, sir.""

I flipped another switch and the engines sputtered their last breath. And my ship started to drift, the eerie blackness of the world around me grew darker, and the cold overtook me. I started to sleep.

_________

The hum grew louder. Louder than the engines had ever hummed before. They rattled and clanked and sputtered and spat. And my eyes began to open, slowly, then as the light overtook me, all at once. 

""Boss, he's waking up,"" the voice was foreign to me. It was a deep, cruel voice. Not Martha's soothing robotic one. 

Then the footsteps, another voice, ""Good. He should be coming to any moment now.""

My ship had a single cockpit, no one could walk around in it. 

The air was stale, almost tasteless as my dry mouth reached out for anything. Anything that these strange voices would give me. A cold cup hit my lips, followed by a rush of water. It reminded me of the Waterfalls on Eriandus that looked like mouths, continuously gushing out water, instead of sipping it in slowly like I did.

My vision came to me slowly at first, but within a few minutes of drinking the water, I saw the voices. A strange, burly man with red hair and eyes as cool as the forests of Earth herself. The second, a smaller man with a bald head, his only hair being the red mustache which twirled around his nostrils. They both looked at me, before smiling.

""Welcome back,"" the small man said, ""I'm Rael.""

""Grio,"" the burly man said.

I choked on my own words, wondering who these people were, where I was, and more importantly, why I wasn't dead.

""My Captain's heart-rate is spiking,"" the soothing voice of Martha filled my ears. It started to feel like I was back in that ship again, even though I knew I wasn't. 

""Martha?""

""Hello, Captain.""

I tried to lean forward, but my muscles were weak, they ached with pain. And not the pain I was used to, this was new pain, as if every joint in my body was frozen together before being thawed out through bone-breaking procedures. Rael placed his arm on me, it was warm. ""Easy there, you've been through a lot.""

""Who-who are you?""

""Didn't we just say that?"" Grio said.

""Oh, don't mind him,"" Rael continued, ""he's cranky.""

Grio snorted and turned away from the two of us.

""You're safe, a lot safer than when we found you. In our outpost, a few sectors from a civilized planet.""

Rael looked strange to me; I knew he was human of course, but there was something off about him. As if he was something *more* than human, but *less* human at the same time. ""Where *did* you find me?""

""In your space shuttle, packed like an ice cube,"" Rael laughed, ""You were on the verge of death when we found you, adrift in undocumented space.""

I shook my head, ""Ice cube?""

""You were frozen. To the point that it actually slowed down your metabolic rate,"" he laughed again, ""you basically saved yourself.""

""No, no,"" I shook my head again, ""I can't save myself. Myself is killing me.""

""Oh,"" Rael said, ""You mean that old disease? We took care of it.""

My eyes widened, ""What?""

""Your cancer,"" he said, ""haven't seen a case like that in what? Grio, when was Teni here?""

""Twenty years!"" Grio said from another room.

""Twenty years, yes,"" he looked back to me, ""quick clean up.""

""No, I was terminal.""

""Well, whoever made that diagnosis clearly *messed* something up."" He slid away from using a chair, but it seemed to bounce and hover off the ground instead.

I stood up a bit more, feeling my bones crack under their use again. It hurt, it hurt like all the hurt in the world, but I knew I needed answers. Something here wasn't right. The atmosphere, the people, the idea that my cancer could up and be *cured* like that.

""I hope you don't mind,"" Rael said as he plucked a hefty black box from a container, ""In order to save you, I had to dig into your journals. Fascinating stuff in there.""

I sighed deeply, it wasn't fascinating at all. Surely this was God, playing some practical joke on me.

""Up until you, Earth had been all but lost to us.""

That hit me more than the pain of my own bones. Earth being lost, ""How do you lose a planet?""

""Through war of course!"" He dropped the black box on a floating table and smiled, ""Hundreds of years of it.""

""What?""

He smiled such an intense smile that I swore I was looking at a sun and not *teeth*. ""That's the other fascinating thing. Your little act of cryopreservation in your, might I add *ancient*, ship, kept you alive for a few hundred years. Martha here sent distress signals, but Grio and I were the only two insane enough to go after something so old.""

""Hundreds of years?""

""According to your journal, your final entry was 2134, before the war."" He seemed to do some math in his head as fumbled with the numbers, ""That would put your frozen state at just over three hundred and forty-six years. Which means, with your star calendar, you are in year 2480."" He smiled again, ""Welcome to the future, *Captain*.""

"[WP] In the far future you have been diagnosed with a terminal illness. With only a year left to live you purchase a ship and head out into space, looking for one last adventure.",Archontor,"“PC-214, you’re clear for final preparations.”

Strapped in tight. Safe. Just me and the Black – boldly going wherever we could before the final motes of my Colour squeezed themselves shut and the Black claimed me for itself.

“Engines warm. Prepare for countdown.”

The vertical cockpit gave me a wide view of the myriad stars above. So many opportunities to see foreign shores, to hear foreign tongues. Would I do enough? Would I see enough to make the final year of my life worth the price paid in the rest? Looking out, I fixed my gaze on one particular constellation and wondered at the Colour I would find there.

“Ten.”

This place had exhausted me. The rushing, panicking, jolting life I had pretended to enjoy had cracked and splintered, letting the Black in. It started at the edges; my index finger, a nail on my left foot. I didn’t have the Colour in me to fight back, but I couldn’t leave my life for long enough to bring the Colour in. A circling, nearing impossibility consumed me slowly at first – piece by piece. I hated myself for it, and the circle spun faster.

“Nine.”

There was Colour once. I remembered the sea, swirling and churning in its emerald majesty. The rain on my face as my father and I watched wave after wave crash on the shore, dragging the old sand away just as it brought in the detritus of the ocean in blues, oranges, greens and reds. That Colour was gone now too, I assumed. The waves had continued to crash and suck at that shore, as the Black had done to the shores of my own body.

“Eight.”

Sunlight, whole and warming, filtering slowly through the needles of a pine. A body next to mine, laying twined within the fallen leaves and within each other. The touch of her hand, the taste of her lips. These things had Colour. If I had fought for her to stay, if she had wanted to – would there be Colour now too?

“Seven.”

The constellation I had fixed my gaze on dissolved into the open sky, one of millions more. It was my fault, I decided. My choices have all lead to this moment. A lifetime spent with my head bowed in reverence to the monoliths of glass and steel on this planet. The sparkling veneer of Colour on the outside was too much to resist; the promise of riches within blinded me to the Black at the core.

“Six.”

It was easier, then, to pretend that I had more Colour than I really did. Wear a smiling mask at family gatherings, show off the new bauble in my pocket, in my wallet, in my garage. When the diagnosis came it was almost a relief. The cracks in my Colour were too wide to disguise any longer – at least they would all know the truth. 

“Five.”

She was the first one to cry as I told them all the news. My father, stoic and calm, fixed me with a resolved look and put an arm of comfort around my mother; herself deflated, tired, resigned – but not crying. The only tears came from her. Had I meant so much? Had my Colour been more to her than it had even been to me? She touched her lips to mine, just as she had done that day amongst the pines and sunlight. It would be okay, she had said. But it wouldn’t. It wasn’t.

“Four.”

I told her my plan three months later. It had to be me, and only me. I was insistent. I was implacable. I was cruel. But it was for the best. Her Colour would far outlive my own, and I wanted her to go on, to give herself to others just as she had done to me. I felt the chasm of Black within me yawn wider as she closed the door.

“Three.”

But I am still here. No matter the diagnosis, no matter the unkind words. No matter the hurt and the pain, the lies and deceit. I am still here, and the Black does not have all of me yet. I fix my eyes to a new light on the horizon and I steel my resolve. There is more within me, and I am determined to see it before I am taken.

“Two.”

Another second and I’ll be gone. A year, mine for the taking. A year to submerge myself in the Colour of the universe. I will see the light play across alien sands and I will taste new air, new food, new tongues before I am consumed. I will lift myself away from the Black for as long as I can. I will fight.

“One.” 

My mind reaches back to the memory of the waves, the washed up Colour brought in with each breaking roll. My father lifted me onto his shoulders, so I could stretch my hand out to the horizon, running my fingertips across the boundary between sea and sky, between finite and infinite. I would lift myself this time; I would reach my own boundaries.

“Lift off.”

Perhaps it is all in the lifting.

Suddenly save for the beeps of the navigational computers and the slight whirr of the air support system it was almost silent. We had reached the first destination of what was to be my final yet most important expedition. 

The view from the small window situated at the very front of the bridge offered full a tight view of a dense asteroid field. Luckily the ship was small enough to manoeuvre through it. She wasn't much but when I retired from captaining I managed to talk my way into keeping her and had worked hard at keeping her in good condition. ""Easy does it, we can make it through"" I was saying to myself, but also for the benefit of Flau'oc to calm his nerves. Flau'oc had been my second in command on many previous voyages and silently my best friend, he was one of the most advanced weapons technicians I had the privilege of serving with during the galactic civil war and the rising of the system lords.

The wreckage of previous ships attempting salvage and mining operations had made the asteroid fields of the Taeri cluster unpredictable due to the gravitational pull of each of body in the cluster. A moments negligence could find you with an asteroid in your path or wreckage colliding with your ship. What we were looking for was the wreckage of the Orion. The Orion's mission was to aid in the search for a cure to a biological weapon used by Barien, one of the most powerful system lords. It was reported that an agent serving on the Orion had managed to steal information from on of Barien's flagships and had been on the run. It's last known destination was Rhoo which was one of the small planets of this cluster to find a place to hide and secure this information as the Orion's long range communication systems had been damaged in the escape. One of Barien's scouting parties had managed to catch up to the Orion and the report states that the Orion was destroyed entirely, however rumours state that there may still be wreckage intact due to the Orion's advanced cloaking systems. Perhaps there may have even been survivors if the escape pods had been jettisoned. 

My first mission was to determine the validity of these rumours, as I had a personal stake in finding a cure.

"[WP] In the far future you have been diagnosed with a terminal illness. With only a year left to live you purchase a ship and head out into space, looking for one last adventure.",Archontor,"*One year, give or take.*

*Give or take,* Leo thought. *I will both give and take that year for myself.*

It seemed rather odd and tragic to Leo that, despite humanity's incredible advances over the past century, men were just as susceptible to certain illnesses and diseases as they had always been. When journeys to the stars became not only practical, but commonplace, it began what was both an era of wonder and an era of disillusion.

Man could travel to distant stars in relatively short order. Many expected the discovery of intelligent -- or at least complex -- life to follow soon after. Yet over 100 years later, and mankind was still the only intelligent life in the known galaxy. Even the several Earth-like worlds had yielded only simple life; microorganisms and bacteria -- seeds yet to yield the kind of life Earth had fostered hundreds of millions of years ago. 

Yes, mankind had become somewhat disillusioned with their home galaxy over the last century or so. To be sure, it did not lack for wonder and new discoveries, but some of the bigger mysteries -- some of mankind's greatest hopes -- had yet to produce any desirable answers. 

Further still, other schools of science had yet to live up to the rapid progress of space travel. Certainly, medical science and the like had made strides people only years ago would consider miraculous. In spite of those strides, some illnesses and diseases continued to elude humanity's smartest minds, periodically manifesting in people and taking their lives as they have always done.

*Man has taken to the stars, yet he is still vulnerable to the same things that threatened him when he was living in caves, hunting wild animals with spears; when fire was his greatest scientific discovery,* Leo mused. *Of course I would be one of those to fall victim to man's most ancient and prolific killer.*

*One year, give or take.*

Those words stuck with Leo from the moment the doctor uttered them. Not a minute went by without them barging into his mind. The words were both a persistent reminder of his mortality and a motivator to do...something. 

Only a few days after his diagnosis, Leo hopped into his starship and embarked on a journey. Truth be told, he had not given the journey much thought. He did not bother himself with logistics or plans or goals or purpose. He knew only where he aimed to go, but knew not what he would do when he got there. He was certain of one thing, however: he would not be coming back.

The galactic core was a demanding journey. Even with the incredible advancements in space travel, it still required around a year's worth of traveling to reach. Yet it wasn't the time it took to travel there that posed the most significant hurdle; rather, it was the treacherous nature of space itself. Space travel, though advanced, was still imperfect. Jumping from star to star was a gamble to some extent, and the average person would only travel along known routes so as to eliminate the majority of the risk within that gamble. Once you travel beyond inhabited space and into mostly uncharted areas of the galaxy, you were more or less at the mercy of the elements. As such, very few had successfully made the journey to the galactic core, and fewer still had managed to return. 

*One year, give or take.*

Oddly enough, Leo took some solace in the fact that he would not have to concern himself with a return trip. He would travel to the galactic core and witness for himself the beauty of stars so clustered together it were as though they were hugging, like brothers and sisters and fellow family members. He would see sights mostly unseen, not for some great scientific purpose or discovery, but simply for himself -- for that one year he had left. 

*Give or take.*

And his journey would come to an end at the heart of it all. He would lay eyes upon *the* core. He would witness Sagittarius A, the supermassive black hole responsible for the galaxy's formation. It was something only a handful of people had ever seen with their own eyes and lived to tell the tale. Leo, however, would see it as no one had seen it before. Leo had accepted that his journey was a one-way trip, and he did not intend to let his illness claim his life. If there was one thing Leo still had control over, it was how he would live his last moments and how he would die, and he settled on the answer to the latter when he was just over the halfway point of his journey. 

Almost exactly one year later, and Leo had arrived. He had traveled past areas around the galactic core so bright from neighboring stars that not even the shaders on his ship's windows could dim the light. It was at times so blinding that he had to reroute his course in order to reach his destination. In this part of the galaxy, there was no darkness, no night. He flew past countless planets bathed in eternal daylight; planets which would never know the oppressive cold of the dark. This final leg of his journey made Leo recall something his late father would say to him as a child whenever he was troubled.

*""It is always darkest before the dawn.""*

Leo smiled to himself. *And what if the dawn never ends, father?*

It was as though Leo's father answered immediately. Almost as soon as that memory crossed Leo's mind, he saw it. The heart of darkness, and also the center of creation...at least as far as the Milky Way is concerned. Before him was Sagittarius A, a monstrosity so massive that it appeared as though it would soon swallow Leo despite his ship still being several light years from the event horizon. Leo felt a quiver shoot up and down his spine.

*One year, give or take.*

Leo stared into the epitome of nothingness; the embodiment of destruction, yet also the very thing to which humanity owed its existence. *It is an incomprehensibly massive contradiction,* Leo thought. 

Leo's ship inched closer and closer, the edges of the gravitational lensing spreading further and further to the corners of his vision until he could see only the all-encompassing *nothingness* before him. 

His ship's system warnings began screaming and yelling at him. All manner of lights and screens began flashing, pleading with him to turn back. Leo flipped some switches and went through a few inputs to placate his ship. *This is what I must do.*

Soon, the unending daylight that had characterized the galactic core seemingly moments earlier had been snuffed out as Leo was swallowed by the imposing dark. Leo could no longer sense if he was moving at all. Now, there was only *nothing*. Now, time stood still.

*One year, give or take.*

It was the last time those words would have any meaning to him. Leo sat back as his ship continued to carry him into the unknowable. He was not scared or afraid. He reminded himself that he knew this was a one-way trip before he ever embarked on the journey. He knew not what the coming moments would bring as the darkness continued to engulf him. He knew only one thing.

*It is always darkest before the dawn.* ",TheWaker

The writings of Carl Sagan, along with other ancient writers like Socrates and Shakespeare filled many a classroom in our youth. Sagan was always my favorite, though. His innocent, almost child-like wonder of the heavens resonated with innocent, childish me. I've probably spent half my childhood with my eyes glued to screens filled with stars, nebulae and cold, distant planets.

But very few men of only exquisite wealth or blinding intellect ever reach boundaries further than our own solar system. I was nothing more than a spaceship mechanic. Touching the outside of these incredible machines was the closest I've ever gotten to space. 

It was easy to dream up plans of taking the Solar Tour, an eight stop cruise of our neighbors and their satellites. However, it proved to be much more difficult to actually make the funds available. The vacation kept getting pushed back further and further until I gave up any hope. 

There are stages of grief when you find out you are about to die, so they say. Not for me; I only felt a liberation when I left the hospital with an expiration date stamped on my medical record. 

At work, I was putting the finishing touches on a SCX 3100R, a small, zippy bird. I ran my hand over the smooth contour of the wing. The idea came as quick as a light switch. I jumped in the cock-pit, and rolled it out to the runway. 45 seconds later, I was airborne. 

Eighty percent of my life has been dedicated to the inner workings of these majestic birds. I knew them better than most pilots. The childish wonder washed over my old, dying body. I was above the buildings, then the clouds. I was above the sky. 

And now, I am passing Saturn's rings. The VR tours do it no justice. I can't convey the largeness and the raw beauty those rings possess. My plan is to visit the Crab Nebula. If there's time, maybe pass by Betelgeuse. 

It's sad how we won't do what we want to until there's almost no time left to do it.

I know they will catch me, eventually. But what are they going to do?

I mean, not that I'm a *super*-villain, per se. But I'm a pretty damn good villain.

I can establish dominance over anyone that I meet, as long as I have a line of direct eye contact to them. After that, they're just a glorified bag of meat, eager to please me, until I release them.

Chunks of stone and metal fly everywhere, one hitting the secretary I brought in to carry out my money in the head and killing her. Another hit the bank manager's knee and he dropped like a rock.

"[WP] You find a room with many screens, with a different version of you on each. Below each screen is a button that says ""switch.""",Chrytical,"I admit, I've always been kind of impulsive. That's how I got here, actually. The elevator door opened on a floor I'd never before seen, somewhere between the first story and my office. Even that might not have caught my attention... it's a tall building, so people get on at all sorts of places and I normally don't even look up from my phone.

This time, though, the elevator slowed to a halt, the doors slid open, and not a single person walked in. Annoyed that my journey had been delayed for nothing, I glared out into the hallway.

Maybe there's more to this building that I haven't seen than parts I have, but even so, this place seemed strange. The color scheme was way off, all cool blues and greys, with no windows to allow natural light. Most floors feature inoffensive beiges and browns, interior design created with the intention of going completely unnoticed by anyone who walks in. Too many different businesses with too many unique aesthetics have collaborated to create something that does not clash with any of them.

Comparatively, this floor didn't look like it fit in at all. Like it was part of an entirely different building.

The doors began to shut, and without thinking I stuck out my hand to stop them. I stepped out of the elevator without even taking note of which floor it was. Something between 1 and 29, I knew that much, but I couldn't tell you how far up I'd gone before it stopped.

Walking down the corridor, I saw doors on either side of me, each bearing a plaque with a name on it. Just like the office doors elsewhere in the building. Just like my own, Office 2914, some floors above. I started to wonder if this floor was in use by a business that had demanded its own special decorating team. Nothing about it seemed particularly impossible until I got to the door that was a long way down and to the right, the same spot where my own office door could be found on my floor. I looked at the name, thinking maybe I could knock on the door and meet my counterpart on Floor Weird, only to discover that it was my name up there in those bold black letters.

The door was locked, and nobody answered at my knock, but my key fit and I managed to get it open. For a moment, I thought that maybe my own floor had been repainted, that this was my office after all. But no, this room did not resemble my office at all. There was no desk. No window. No comfy chair, no valiantly surviving potted plant. Not even my fancy dual-monitor computer setup was there.

Instead, I found a much fancier monitor arrangement, a wall full of them. All the same size, fairly small but all together they covered the space from floor to ceiling.

I walked into the room, looking carefully at each of the monitors. I recognized the person shown on each of them. It took a moment to convince myself, but there was no denying the truth. Each monitor displayed an image of me.

At first I thought this must be archival footage, video of me from earlier parts of my life. But one monitor showed me climbing up the side of a volcano. Another showed me snorkling alongside tropical fish. In one I was swinging from rope to rope in a complex of treetop buildings. None of those matched any of my memories. So these videos, whatever they were, were not historical.

As I pondered their meaning, at last I took notice of the buttons that took up the space below each monitor. ""SWITCH,"" the buttons proclaimed. Switch what? Switch view? Or maybe I could switch two of these versions of me with each other, see what kinds of skills one had that might be useful in another's place?

Here's where my impulsive nature got me in trouble. I was curious as to what those buttons could do, so I pressed one.

It wasn't until I was standing knee-deep in a swamp, surrounded by men and women who looked every bit as damp and miserable as I felt. It was near sunset, and the people around me were moving quietly, while I started to shiver from the cold. It took several minutes for me to connect the sight of the people around me to an image I'd glanced, just for a moment, back in the room. I'd seen myself in a swamp, wading around at sunset, and now here I was in a swamp, wading around at sunset.

I didn't understand what the hell we were doing out there until months later. These people went out to the swamp nearly every day, and I went with them. Gradually I figured out who they were, and who *I* now was. We worked for an ecological institute, and took surveys of the wildlife that lived here. Sometimes we were trying to spot a particular plant or creature, to see if it still lived in the area. Other times, we simply counted birds, or reported back any trash or debris that we located. The pay was abysmal and the work was grueling. I did not like this life one bit.

I miss my home. I miss my office. I miss the building I used to work in, with its imposing exterior and boring interior.

Unfortunately, I can barely make rent out here. I don't seem to own a car, and a plane ticket home is expensive. I plan to make it back someday. I don't know if I'll be able to pick up where I left off, or if there's another me that's already taken my place.

I have a plan for that, though. If I get to that building and there's somebody in my office, I'll just go downstairs, floor by floor, until I find that place again. The one with all the monitors, all the buttons. It was a mistake to push one by impulse, but I'm certain, *absolutely certain*, that I'll be doing the right thing when I press one next time.",narrativedilettante

“Why do I need to study our heritage dad?” I asked.  
“Address me as your ‘vater,’ a word our ancestors called their fathers, ” Siegfried Schultz, my crazy and cooky father, sternly stated.  He typically wore a button-down shirt with a black or brown vest on top and a set of beige slacks beneath.  The buffoon looked like he walked straight out of a Victorian novel.  

Today was yet another “lineal lesson” with dad.  Every weekday after I finished homework, dad would interrupt just in time to give a 15 minute lecture on German, English, or Italian culture and language.  Dad always cited the importance of knowing where one came from, as when he died, someone else (me) would have to teach the family’s descendants our history.  His fanaticism stemmed from early childhood detachment mother had told me.  His own father was never around and had constantly been out on “adventures” of some sort.  Though according to Dad, the man would only come home in dizzy and drunken stupors claiming to have seen the world’s history in Inglandia, Deustchmach, or Eteliano.  Father couldn’t believe the lies of the one man who was *never* there when he was needed.  Instead, my father researched the *real* countries of England, Germany, and Italy.  Although his own father was a drunkard, my papa worked hard.  And while I still can’t stand sitting through his classes, he means the world to our family.  

“Fa-,” I began.  Siegfried raised his hand, visibly objecting. “Vater, are we done for today?”  Father took out his brass and silver pocket watch —the design intricately wove layers upon layers of silvery trails across a brazen landscape— and checked the time.  I always thought the watch added to his innate quirkiness.  It ticked to a beat unlike any grandfather, cuckoo, or analog clock would have.  The watch seemed to skip seconds, counting out a monotonous, but consistent tik-tok.  

“I suppose this is all we have time for today.  Our session, out sitzung, is adjourned,” he liked to mix in foreign words, often in a confusing attempt to teach me them.    

Father left the room in a hurry; apparently, he was going to miss the next episode of “World Fineries” a showcase of the extravagances of the “globe,” even though it was usually just Europe.  His watch lingered on the table.  I snatched the device and slipped it into a pocket.  

“I’m gonna… play some games dad.  I’ll be down for dinner,” I saw his nod and scurried upstairs.  As lame as his outfit was, the watch was really neato.  The silver laces encased the circular shape with a detail that you wouldn’t expect from this century.  I flicked the timepiece in hand and the hinge quietly squeaked open.  The watch *was* weird.  Inside, it had three different circles.  The first was the largest, and what you would expect from the old-timey machine: a clock keeping track of seconds, minutes, and hours.  The second circle, located in the bottom-left of the construction looked to be a compass of sorts.  It had a two-sided pointer that indicated a direction, but the labels were not the N, S, E, and W I had expected.  Instead, I saw… runes?  They were like the ones dad showed me were used by Germanic tribes.  The third was an oddly digital display, with a number “**8**” laid out in neon green light.  I marveled at how such an old piece of technology could have something so modern on it; but, after staring for almost an hour, the number never changed.  I placed my finger on it.  

A cloak of darkness washed over me.  I felt solid material on my butt and back, like a chair.  The only light came from the watch in my hand.  The bright green number was still there, but it read, “**7**” now.  Hmumm, it sounded like one of those generators from survival games just switched on.  As if on cue, seven screens of light surrounded me.  Below each was a flashing red light that said, “SWITCH” like a neon sign.  The slide directly ahead of me was like a mirror.  I saw myself sitting there staring at the pocket watch, but I didn’t make any movements and the watch was far more ordinary this time.  It was just an iron.  Time had iced over that moment and my finger remained on the watch.  I gazed around the room, and every portrait depicted myself touching that watch, frozen in action.  The screens directly adjacent to my own revealed scenes of monstrosities.  To the left, I was surrounded by yetis, but there was no snow in the shot.  To the right of my personal slide, beings of flesh and machinery were fused to create abominations of their own: dogs whose paws, jaws, and foreheads had been melded with metal bared their fangs at me and a man whose joints had been replaced with servos standing behind.  The man was clearly the orchestrator of the hardship I would soon face there.  I surveyed the room and each depiction was just a perilous as the last, but each scene other than my own also had the ornate pocket watch of my father’s.  

“WHAT PATH WILL YOU WALK?” A voice boomed. 

“Who a-are you?” I stammered.  The voice had shaken the small room.  

“GLOBETROTTER EDMUND SCHULTZ, I AM Sz-Thed-Kaool, THE TWENTY FIRST KEEPER OF THE PARALLELS.  MAKE YOUR CHOICE.  RETURN TO NORMALITY, OR SEEK A FUTURE WORTH DYING FOR.  PRESS THE SWITCH AND CHOOSE,” the voice actually explained itself, wow.  

“What if, what if I don’t?”  

“FEEBLES HUMAN.  YOUR ESSENCE ONLY EXISTS IN THIS WORLD BECAUSE OF ME.  NOW, DECIDE!”  

And I did.  I pressed the “SWITCH” of my own world and the machine-infested one at the same time.  ",StarvingOrphans

The two men seemed to have known one another for quite some time and really must have had some major problems. They raised their voices louder and louder as the realtor became more frantic. Finally when it appeared they would come to blows, the realtor shouted above them all ""GET OUT! GET OUT GET OUT GET OUT!"" The realtor was seething. He angrily grabbed both men and led them out of his open house.

&amp;nbsp;

""Great going, 'Mr. Geeee.'"" sneered Lou.

""Oh grow up, this is your fault anyway."" replied Mr. G.

Lou became even more angry, ""It's ALWAYS my fault, isn't it? Did you ever stop to think that maybe YOU'RE the one that's wrong?""

&amp;nbsp;

Just as it appeared the bickering would never cease, a bus drove by with an advertisement on the side which read:

*Open House: Today Only! Large House built on 100 acres of land.*

*914 Glenmore Avenue*

*Evans and Associates Realty*

And just like that, both disappeared in an instant.

"[WP] After a freak accident, the writer/narrator discovers he can talk directly to his characters.",ElliottB1,"I think it happened three weeks after the accident. Probably about three weeks. I had sat down at my desk, just like I did every day before it happened. And just like every day, I looked at the words on the screen and was miserable.

*It was a smaller city, a quieter city. But it too lay on a waterfront, was old and full of bustle. When she stepped out into the air, into the city center, she did half wonder if she had gone anywhere at all.*

The words continued on, but I could not bring myself to follow them.

“Something has to happen here,” I muttered. She gets to the new city, doesn’t know anybody, doesn’t have anything she *needs* to do. Infinite possibility.

“So why is it so damn hard to make *anything* happen.”

I didn’t have an answer.

The whole story existed in my mind, big moments and exciting scenes flashing about. *Just connect them* my brain would say, and I would tell it to shut up, because that’s easier said 
than done.

But it should be doable.

I read and I imagined her. A little dazzled, a little frightened. But overwhelmed with this new sense that the world could be hers. For the very first time, a taste of freedom. Where would she go? What would she do?

I pictured her standing there, on the street corner, eyes on the map of the city and her eyes narrowed with concentration. She just needed the right place to be, and a reason to be there. And then the words would come.

“You know,” she said, and she looked direct at me, through the fourth wall of my imagination. “I haven’t spoken to anyone for a while.”

I laughed at that, at myself. “Tropes on tropes,” I said to myself, smiling. “Let’s not go Deadpool up in here.”

“Oh, no,” she said. “No, Rob. Not you. This is all me.”

I’ll admit to feeling a sort of… I guess anxiousness. Interiority is essential for writers, but I’d never carried on a conversation with myself through a character before, and I wondered at my own health. 

“Maybe I wasn’t ready to come home,” I whispered to myself.

“Maybe not,” she said. “But you’ve got that same old self-centeredness, so you seem pretty much yourself.”

I frowned, and decided to engage. “Alright, fine,” I… thought? Said? More like both, really. “Fine,” I said. “What’s this now?”

She smiled at me, tucked a strand of dark brown hair behind her ear. “Well I’m fresh into this new city. I have – “she looked around, played at conspiracy “- my condition, and I’m looking for something new.”

I nodded, looked back up the page. “So far you’re reading from the same script,” I said.

She rolled her eyes. “Well so far you’ve got me dillydallying around waiting for… for what?”

I shook my head. “That’s the problem. I don’t really know what.”

“Romance?” she asked. Hopefully?

“Maybe,” I said. “It’s really about getting you from here and into the factory.”

She looked puzzled at that. “The factory?”

I felt a bit of guilt, and I felt strange for having that guilt. But at this point I was far gone, had accepted her as real, and so I felt guilt.

“It’s where you’ll find yourself. Not for a while, but soon enough.”

She shook her head. “I don’t want to go to a factory,” she said. She looked distressed now.

“I know,” I said. “I don’t want you to end up there either.” And I didn’t. I don’t.

She looked at me. “So why?” she asked.

I shrugged, and I wondered if she could really see me, or if that part of this was one-way. “That’s where you go. That’s where this story goes.”

Something passed through her eyes, or at least I thought so.

“And then where do we go?” she asked.

I smiled. “Wouldn’t you rather live it? You’ll have to wait and see.”

She wrinkled her nose. “Fine. Be like that. As long as it’s not the factory.”

I crossed my heart. “That’s not the last step.”

“So ANYWAY,” she said, overly loud.

“Yes?” I asked.

“So aside from you, oh tyrannical god-person, I have not spoken to anyone in a while. Whatever depressing stuff you have planned, you’re still going to need some white space in this manuscript. Publishers don’t want to read a shit ton of your oh-so-deep thoughts.”

She had me there.

“Alright,” I said. “Fair point. Who would you like to meet?”

She got a mischievous smile. “Let’s make him a man,” she said. “Artistic type.”

“How about a sculptor?” I asked.

She shrugged. “Doesn’t matter to me. Just as long as he’s artsy and a little pretentious.”

I got a little sinking feeling in my stomach, which is ridiculous. “What are you planning?” I asked.

She laughed, a delighted and gently evil sound. “You’ll have to wait and see.”

I frowned, and looked back to the keyboard. I pecked at the keys.

*She looked away from the map and down the street. The sun was falling, and she had not eaten for a while.*

*“Food,” she said, in an idle tone. Food would help pass the time, help her to gather her thoughts. It was a shame to eat alone, but there was nothing to be done about that.*",robexperiencingrob

*Huge humanoid (human?), chaotic evil*  
___
**Armor Class** 21 (+3 plate armor of invulnerability)  
**Hit Points** 210 (20d12 + 80)  
**Speed** 40', climb 40', fly 40' (hover)
___
STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA
:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
22 (+6)|16 (+3)|17 (+3)|14 (+2)|14 (+2)|18 (+4)
___
**Saving Throws** Str +12, Con +9, Dex +9, Wis +8  
**Skills** Arcana +8, Athletics +12, Intimidation +10, Perception +8  
**Damage Resistances** all nonmagical damage  
**Senses** darkvision 120', truesight 30', passive Perception 11  
**Languages** Common, telepathy 120'  
**Challenge** ∞ (No XP)
___

***Action Surge (1/Short or Long Rest).*** The knave takes an additional action this turn.

***Apocalypse Buttstab (1/Long Rest).*** If one of the knave's attacks triggers both his Assassinate and Sneak Attack traits, he can choose to make the attack an ""Apocalypse Buttstab."" When he chooses to do so, the target of the triggering attack takes an additional 55 (10d10) damage from the attack, and a blast of explosive thunder emanates outward, forcing all creatures within 60', including the original target, and not including the knave to make a DC 21 Constitution saving throw. An affected creature takes 44 (8d10) thunder damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much on a successful one.

***Armor of Invulnerability (1/Day).*** As an action, the knave can make himself immune to nonmagical damage for 10 minutes or until he is no longer wearing the armor.

***Assassinate.*** During his first turn, the knave has advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn. Any hit the knave scores against a surprised creature is a critical hit.

***Bardic Inspiration (4/Short or Long Rest).*** The knave can inspire others through his stirring words. To do so, he uses a bonus action on his turn to choose one creature other than himself within 60' of him who can hear him. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d8.  
&amp;nbsp; Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.  
&amp;nbsp; The knave can also use his Bardic Inspiration to inspire others in battle. A creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from the knave can roll that die and add the number rolled to a weapon damage roll it just made. Alternatively, when an attack roll is made against the creature, it can use its reaction to roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to its AC against that attack, after seeing the roll but before knowing whether it hits or misses.

***Evasion.*** If the knave is subjected to an effect that allows him to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the knave instead takes no damage if he succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if he fails.

***Jack of All Trades.*** The knave adds +3 to the result of any ability check that he makes that doesn't include his proficiency bonus.

***Indomitable (2/Long Rest).*** If the knave fails a saving throw, he may re-roll it and use the second result.

***Sneak Attack (1/Turn).*** The knave deals an extra 13 (4d6) damage when he hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5' of an ally of the knave that isn't incapacitated and the knave doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

***Second Wind (1/Short or Long Rest).*** As a bonus action, the knave regains 1d10 + 14 hit points.

***Spellcasting.*** The knave is a 5th-level Bard. His spellcasting ability is Charisma and he uses a +3 spellcasting focus, a *wand of the war mage* (spell save DC 18, +13 to hit with spell attacks). He knows the following bard spells:

* Cantrips (at will): *blade ward, thunderclap, vicious mockery*
* 1st level (4 slots): *cure wounds, detect magic, earth tremor*
* 2nd level (3 slots): *cloud of daggers, detect thoughts, shatter*
* 3rd level (2 slots): *bestow curse, stinking cloud*

####Actions

***Multiattack.*** The knave makes three weapon attacks.

***+3 Vorpal Greatsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 5', one target. *Hit:* 16 (2d6 + 9) slashing damage. This is a magical weapon attack which ignores resistance to slashing damage.  
&amp;nbsp; Additionally, when the knave attacks a creature that has at least one head with this weapon and rolls a 20 on the attack roll, he cuts off one of the creature’s heads. The creature dies if it can’t survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, doesn’t have or need a head, has legendary actions, or the GM decides that the creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra 27 (6d8) slashing damage from the hit.

***+3 Shortsword of Life Stealing.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 5', one target. *Hit:* 12 (1d6 + 9) piercing damage. This is a magical weapon attack.  
&amp;nbsp; When the knave attacks a creature with this weapon and rolls a 20 on the attack roll, that target takes an extra 10 (3d6) necrotic damage, provided that the target isn’t a construct or an undead. The knave then gain temporary hit points equal to the extra damage dealt.

***Mass Polymorph (1/Long Rest).*** Each creature the knave chooses within a 300'-diameter sphere centered on a point within 400' of him must make a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw. A creature that fails its saving throw is permanently polymorphed into an amount of pudding (or some other similarly inert substance) equivalent in mass to the creature's former body.

"[WP] Little did they know: the human species had already evolved a fine spinneret, unbeknownst to most... Oh the beaut!ful webs those weavers dream!",JhihWhhiz,"Listen well, hatchlings, and I will spin you a tale of the most bizarre sentients this world has ever known.

They were called Human, and they walked on two legs, like birds. But where birds are clad in feather and wing, the Human were clad in soft flesh, like the hippo. And much as the hippo will destroy all who enter its waters, the Human destroyed much of the land that they lived on.

This is most of the story that you have probably heard. How the Human brought upon the Acid Rains and the Year of Fire, how they evicted our brethren from their ancestral homes, and then after making such a mess of the world, they all left. Died, perhaps, or emigrated somewhere else...

But here is what you haven't heard, young ones, and those who survive to adulthood with this knowledge may become shamans, like me. Perhaps I am looking at the face of my future apprentice. 

For the Human, despite their bizarre form, and their lack of mandible, and their hippo-like constitution... the Human were Weavers beyond weaving. As they destroyed our forests they spun nests of steel and asphalt, great webs the size of continents. They spun stories in colors we can barely comprehend. We are still deciphering their Writings, we are still piecing together the mystery of Math.

The Human made everything you stand on. They blasted the forest into a desert and built another forest on top of it, a forest of metal and stone. Look at the vines which wrap around your feet, see the crevices they climb into, those perfectly straight lines which denote a Human creation. Think of the Great Tree, how utterly perfect its shape, too perfect to have been created by nature alone...

Already some of you are leaving. I do not blame you. Those who stay, come closer and watch my words intently. This is the most important part, and the most blasphemous.

Can you understand, hatchling, that the Human plague both destroyed and remade our world? Can you understand that everything we live on, everything we hunt, everything we see, was touched by a Human in some way?

Yes? Now listen. Everything you see around you was made by a Human. The floors, the vines, the tree... and you. 

The elders will never tell you this but shamans know it is true, we have kept this knowledge alive for as long as knowledge has lived. We were made by the Human. Not just our people, but all of the peoples. The Rockfish and the Crying Dove and the Coyote, just as the forests were re-made in the Human image so were we. Before the Human touched us we were animals, mindless. We hunted each other. We were eaten by birds. Our lifespan was measured in seasons, not decades.

The Human took our ancestors, and they made the Great Tree, and they placed us in the tree with our bird cousins and the termites, and they said, ""Make it better. Don't screw it all up like we did.""

So think about this the next time your elders spin a song about the Human, about what they did to the world. Yes, they broke it all, but they gave it to us to fix. This is your ultimate duty as a Weaver, beyond protecting your clan or your Tree. You are here to protect life. You are here to preserve.

That is all an old Weaver has to say for the day. ",homeforinfiniteloser

"[EU] In a distant future, Superman has outlived humanity on Earth, and must find a new home.",Jomajorsh,"""I was too slow,"" he whispered. It had become his mantra, muttered under his breath as he walked to wastes, small clouds of ashen dust exploding at his feet. 

In the distance, the spiked remains of sky scrapers. They looked like gothic towers, something you'd see on the cover of an old vampire novel. The sky behind them was a bleak, sickly yellow. 

He stopped, feeling the first pangs of hunger in three months. He took out some jerky and bit off a piece. It tasted of dust, of nothingness. 

Behind him, his tattered red cape swayed in the breeze, although it was more of a brown now. The blue of his costume was likewise ripped and frayed, its fabric bleached by the relentless Earthen sun, and the shockwaves of the countless bombs that fell on that day six months ago.

Truth is, he was too slow. At first he tried to stop all the missiles from touching down, then he tried to protect the larger cities. Then he made due with protecting a the capitals of each country. Even then he had failed. Aside from feral pockets of pseudo civilization, humanity was no more.

Dust. Everything dust. And here he stood, a hero to no one. 

He looked to the sky. This planet no longer needed saving--not because he had rid it of crime, of greed and petulance, but because he had failed it. Because he was too *fucking* slow. 

He rose from the ground, slowly at first, the landscape around him growing more and more unreal the higher he got. Nothing but brown, with the odd blackened crater. 

He flew above the clouds, ascended until there was no more air to breath. He felt the sun on his skin, felt stronger than he had in ages, but he couldn't help but feel weak. 

Superman. Saviour of humanity. God among men. 

He stared at the lifeless brown and blue marble, orbiting his precious Sol, and it hurt his heart immeasurably to know that the planet was a lifeless husk, was as silent as it seemed in the dark wastes of space. 

He chose a direction, and he flew. ",MisterMovember

A figure struggled through the fire attempting to find its source no matter how hopeless. The heat was like that of a forest fire, It's tongues brushing against Richard with a sense of delicacy. The metal surrounding him was becoming blazing hot causing him to take of his mask.

 Another scream rang across the air. He didn't know how many criminals were in the building but at this rate there wouldn't be any left to protect from the psycho who brought him here. He was unsure if this was the only building hit with incendiary bombs.

 Stumbling down the hallway he came face to face to with one of the criminals. Hypno-something. A moment of horror turning into one of realisation and relief played across the criminals face. He began to react running to Richard as he struggled to shuffle along the wall.

 At this time a sword rushed through hypnos chest with Richard helpless to stop it. No scream, a look of pain instead was starring into his soul. Falling over as his only support was pulled out he revealed a figure pointing a gun at Richard.

 Too exhausted to respond he stood there. It was a chance for him to have a closer look at what he was facing. Kevlar seemed to cover every inch it could. A mask professionally made covered his attackers face. It looked faded. Reflecting the flames around him matching his rage.

"[WP]In the 30th century, music from the 20th century experiences a revival. As a student majoring in music, you write an essay on any song from the 20th century. The catch? You interpret it completely wrong.",Kimchidip,"The song ""Sweet Child O Mine"" by Guns N' Roses is an anthemic tune from the late 1980s about the popular trend of child cannibalism. Beginning with a riff(a series of sounds played by 6 strings strapped to a wooden board that is plugged in to an outlet) that evidently is used to lull the children to sleep before the feast, the song's first verse ""She's got a smile that seems to me/ reminds me of childhood memories/ when everything was as fresh as bright blue sky"" conveys the lead singer's childhood experiences, where the smile was worn by those who were looking for new children. The freshness described in the song alludes to the flesh of the children, as they were often eaten within minutes of death. The frontman then goes to say that in his adult life, when he sees the child described in the song, staying in the child's company for too long results in a breakdown. The chorus is simply the the title of the song repeated twice in order to solidify the topic. The song then continues with the lyrics ""she's got eyes of the bluest skies/ as if they thought of rain/ I'd hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain"" In the late 20th century to the early 21st century, the word hate meant prefer, which would describe his reaction at seeing the children get roasted. The next verse is easily the most cryptic one, but meaning can be taken from it with close examining. The verse which goes ""Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place/ where as a child I'd hide/ and wait for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by"". There are two possible meanings to this verse: either the hair is similar to a hiding place which he frequented whenever he was about to be cooked, or the ""warm hair"" describes the place which he wanted to be cooked at, which hints at his suicidal tendencies. After two more repetitions of the chorus, a ""solo"" is heard, which appears to be no more than a jumble of noise. Many musicians claim that there is a pattern to these frequently heard sections in songs; however, their work is under review. The bridge is then introduced, where the phrase ""where do we go"" is repeated many times. This is obviously an allusion to the discussion as to which barbeque pit to go to in order to cook their next meal. The song ends the title being repeated one more time, but with the word ""child"" being drawn out. In conclusion, while this song deals with topics that are not seen as normal in today's society, it is important as it shows a glimpse into the barbaric 20th century.

Let's go to the cameras with our contestants to get a better look into what's happening now, shall we?""

---

Amanda was ahead of Joseph by a good 10 feet, she wasn't trying to outrun him or leaving behind, that kind of idea doesn't cross your mind in fight or flight. She was just running. Still fuming mad at Joseph for rolling while she was still sleeping for the night, she carried on, surprising herself with how quickly she was able to spring awake and take off with board under her arm and dice in her hand. She told herself again he rolled with good intentions. ""I was 6 spaces away Amanda, I just wanted us to get out of here.""

The vines. One of those goddamn ever moving vines is what did it. Thankfully she no longer heard the rats behind her, so a sneaking, snaking vine coming from under the grass didn't do much more than just throw her to the ground. Cursing in frustration, she got up with empty hands. She felt the panic in her body before she knew why she was afraid.

The board lay open in front of her and she heard the final ring of one of the dice bouncing off a rock in the grass. She looked down and saw slowly the last message of ""Fear not mosquitoes, or spider and bees; as these wretched vermin have deadly disease"" faded away. From the inky blackness, new words were forming. ""A problem for humans is one that you'll face; your deadly hunter was your saving grace."" She was still contemplating the meaning when the rock her her on the side of her head. The last thing she saw before she blacked out was the ground sliding beneath her as hew fiance drug her body into the woods behind. ",KolbyKolbyKolby

Panic spread across his face in glorious 4K resolution as he realized what was happening; there's only one reason they'd want a close-up. His head swiveled around wildly, trying to figure out what was after him. The last thing he saw was head lioness's tawny fur as her jaws closed around his neck.

""Oh, Edmunds is *OUT*!"" Bill Braddock shouted into his microphone, thumping his fist on the table in the commentators booth. ""We all knew that one was coming, but it's still always a bit of a shock to see!""

""Even more shocking is that it was *Edmunds*,"" added his co-host Amanda DeVance. On screen, his biography and stats popped up. ""I mean, he was a safari leader in Kenya for two years! He's the *last* one I expected to die from a lion attack!""

""Oh, absolutely,"" Braddock agreed. ""In the latest betting pool, the odds-on favorite was that he would be bitten by one of the giant mosquitoes."" The cameras switched to one of the massive pests that were currently hovering near the lake in the middle of the island. The autopsy on Shively wasn't done yet, but the doctor's preliminary conclusion was that they carried some sort of unknown pathogen that caused her death in a matter of hours. ""In fact Edmunds kne.... Oh, I'm sorry to interrupt, but it looks like we may have our next roll!""

The cameras trained on four members of the red team who were dashing through the jungle. They'd managed to spot the Blue Team's camp, where the Jumangi board was currently located. To prevent speed-throughs (where players just swiftly rolled the dice before any of the ill effects could actually occur), the board's location was changed after every roll, and teams had to scour the jungle to find it. Blue had made it to the board first this time.

""The real question now,"" Amanda said, ""Is whether the Blue Team will *allow* the Red Team to actually make its roll. Blue is down three members already, whereas Red has only lost one. Blue *might* strategically hide the board in the hopes that Red might lose a few more. Remember, that anaconda that seems to have developed a taste for  Egans is still out there and on the prowl.""

""That's true,"" Braddock chimed in. ""But Blue needs to be careful too. They've taken a risk in bunching up all of their team members together. We could have a repeat of the 10th season, where the entire Yellow Team was killed in one fell swoop."" That game had gone on for two entire years before a replacement team finally managed to haul the board out of the quicksand. 

The drones hovered in the treetops. The world watched as the Red Team approached Blue's camp with their makeshift spears at the ready. Contestants weren't allowed to bring weapons into the arena, but most of them were adept at fashioning their own. They fanned out into the brush and circled around. But the Blue Team welcomed them in and offered up the dice willingly.

""Well I'll be damned!"" Amanda whispered. ""Could this be an alliance forming?""

Braddock shrugged. ""We all know a Jumanji match can make for some strange bedfellows. The Yellow Team is pretty far ahead due to those double fours two turns ago, so Red and Blue might be feeling threatened.""

The Red Team emerged from the brush and stepped into the center of the camp. Akatu, leader of the Blue Team, held out the dice in his hastily bandaged hand. A Red Team member (Lewis, judging by the long blonde ponytail) took one last step... and the ground collapsed beneath her, down into a deep pit. Immediately, the Blue Team members rushed the remaining three with knives drawn. They managed to pin one of them and tie him up, but the other two flitted off in the jungle. Now the Blue Team had two Red captives to force rolls, instead of just the one. That meant that one of the Reds would be expendable; probably a useful diversion. The fewer competitors left at the end, the bigger their share of the prize money.

""OH!"" Braddock shouted. ""It was a trap! I'd forgotten all about their pit!"" On screen, a replay showed the Blue Team digging out the hole almost two days ago, presumably as a trap for animals. But apparently not. ""That was just *brutal*!"" 

Amanda nodded and smirked. ""Yes, it was. And that's Jumanji.""

""You will change your major back or we will stop funding your education, good luck paying your tuition fees and rent on your own, and you will break up with this wizard boy or I *will* have him killed.

It was twilight, the first color of ruddy dawn just beginning to appear over the East. Up on the battlement's walls the guards slept their blessed sleep, glad for the moment to rest and retreat to the refuge of their dreams. A few sentries remained awake, careful not to rouse their comrades as they went about their patrols and duties. A small brazier crackled with low coals, a worn, tired man crouched next to it. He hadn't shaved in days, his armor stained from sweat and blood not his own. A ragged blanket lay wrapped across his shoulders, its mud-stained hem tattered and torn. A priceless rifle lay next to him, an heirloom from an earlier age. Its stock had been broken and replaced many times over, its barrel covered with numerous nicks and scratches. 

Small feet sounded up the stone staircase of the nearest tower, the tired man's dark green eyes glancing up at the noise. At the top of the stairs appeared a small Elvish girl, her dusky face hidden in the shadows of her cloak. Her clothes were made of a better cloth than his, though still suffered from the wear and damage of the trail. She held a basket in her hands, something warm and fragrant floating from underneath the cloth cover.

""Faith,"" he greeted with a nod.

Faith Alathir stepped past a sleeping warrior, the hem of her cloak brushing against his booted feet. 

""I brought you some breakfast,"" she whispered. ""Figured you wouldn't want to leave the walls.""

Hilary Flint smiled sadly.

""Thanks, kid. And no, I wouldn't.""

Faith knelt besides him and raised the checkered cloth to reveal trays of food and drinking vessels. 

""Mrs. Gagnon made it. There's a couple of breakfast sandwiches in there along with *hash browns*,"" Her tone told him that she was unfamiliar with the word.

""There's also a thermos of coffee and tea both; Mrs. Gagnon was unsure which you prefer. I told her tea, but she said you'd appreciate either.""

Despite himself Flint managed to smile. ""Both is good, when you next see her, give Mrs. Gagnon my thanks.""

He picked up one of the sandwiches, unwrapping it from the wax paper protecting it and taking a bite. The taste of rich eggs and sausage filled his mouth, mixed in with savory bits of grilled onion and pepper. He offered the second one to Faith who took it with barely reserved glee. The two had been on short commons for a week, catching what game they could and foraging for what they couldn't. It was ironic that they ended up eating better in a city under siege.

""Thas soo guud!"" Faith gushed, her face reddening as she remembered to keep her voice down. Flint barely even snorted, concentrating on his own meal. 

He poured a cup of coffee for the both of them, the dark, burnt smell of chicory. Faith wrinkled her nose at the brew but drank it anyways, heedful of the fact that their partaking of the drink deprived it from someone else. She winced at the strong taste; the art of proper tea brewing lost to Humans in this region of the New World. She heard stories that the Fae on the Main Continent had access to an excellent source of tea but sadly that was not the case here. The humans here used pine and willow for many of their brews, healthy to be sure, but sadly lacking in flavor.  

Flint dipped a hash brown in what they called catsup or ketchup and looked out over the parapet towards the siege camp just beginning to stir. 

""Looks like your cousins are getting up as well,"" he said.

""Nothing more than heretics, the lot of them,"" Faith spat with uncharacteristic venom. ""Nothing will please me more than the chance to send them all to their accounting with Belenus.""

Flint chuckled, sensing a moment to needle his charge.

""Why the harsh words for a family squabble?""

Faith turned her gaze towards him with a calculating eye, wondering how much he knew and how much he was just hiding. 

""Our Dark Kin severed themselves from the Path millennia ago when they chose to worship their *new* gods. They turned from the Old Gods and towards crueler, fouler things.""

""A schism? And here I thought you Elves were above such petty things as disagreement and conflict.""

Faith glared at him.

""Sometimes I forget how much of an ass you can be.""

""And don't you forget, deary. But my point still stands.""

""Yes,"" Faith admitted. ""The Elvish Civil War cost us dearly and sowed the seeds for the decline which led to our Arrival here on your world. If anyone's to blame for the destruction of your old kingdoms it's them. They're a pack of traitors and murderesses who'll sooner slit your throat and use your blood for dark magic than let you be at peace. You cannot trust the Dark Kin.""

Flint nodded, and took a sip of his coffee. 

""Perhaps, but over there they might be talking about how the High Elves haven't learned the 'New True Faith' and how you're a bunch of dullards who go on about the glory days. I've fought plenty of Dark Kin, my sword I took from one of their blademasters. I'm even friends with a few. Trust me, Faith, at the end of the day when you get right down to it, they're the same as you and me. Sure, they're perhaps a little more earnest about the whole killing and enslaving thing but at least they admit it. They don't paint themselves as villains the same as you and us humans don't. The world isn't divided into black and white, Faith, most of it's just painted grey.""

"[WP] ""Nobody thinks themselves as evil.""",ZaluthAap,"The canted pillars of Light spill from the upper windows in the old village chapel, illuminating the dust left by generations of the faithful.  Bits and specs float aimlessly in the drafty space, drawn nowhere in particular.  This congregation would be flat and still if it were not for the coming-and-going of the chapel’s only resident: the wrinkly old woman.  

As she winds through dilapidated rows of deer-oak pews and around crumbling stumps of once-glorious stone columns, her soles pattering along the way, the pillars of Light slowly wheel around the room.  It is nearly Spring.  It isn’t the sound of the birds or the smell of the fresh rain which makes this evident, but the arc of the Light.  Soon it must spill on her weathered cheeks.

The Light traces its inevitable path, and the woman continues her trudge.  Both ahead and behind her are slight furrows, perhaps a hand deep, following the route she has walked for days and decades.  In two spots are deeper holes worn into the floor, snug fits for the woman’s stiff knobby knees.  When the Light begins to withdraw, she takes her place and clasps her hands together, pressing them to her forehead.  Only in the stillness of the Dark, when the woman becomes like stone, does the dust begin its slow descent.

It is in the Darkness when her true test begins.  When the last sliver of Light ebbs from the heights, the dust begins to chatter.  Soft moans and hissing gives way to unintelligible whispers.  The specs swell into larger shapes, and the noise blooms into a chorus of woeful wails.  The voices rip and tear at her like a famished bear, speaking in an unfamiliar and unreal tongue.  With her eyes squeezed shut she can still picture the bodies forming in the void.  A petrified posture is all she can do to weather the torment.  

Strangers and lovers alight from the dust in the Dark, old splinters that burst forth from scarred skin.  These horrible, raspy messengers appear as fetid masses of molten, gangrenous flesh, and goad her to open her eyes.

“Nobody thinks themselves as evil”, they coo.  “Until they meet their own true self.”

Ryan spat at the Reverend, who was laying on the dry leaves on the lawn of his mansion, by far the largest building in the compound.  The preacher was bloody and bruised, tilting his head upwards to stare back at Ryan's murderous gaze was a considerable effort.

""Yes Titus, I'm going to put a bullet in your brain for what you done to my sister.""  Ryan said in a breathy tone through gritted teeth. A bruise on his right cheek had begun to form, the Reverend put up more fight than he had expected.

""Your sister?"" The Reverend weezed and sputtered before continuing. ""I ain't even so much as harmed a hair on her head.  Hell we were just getting married tomorrow before you decided it'd be better to just burn down our home boy!"" 

Ryan dropped a heavy boot onto the Reverend's foot, causing him to cough a mixture of saliva and blood onto his own vest.

""Shut up!  I saw you lying with my sister last week! You preach purity and chastity that Sunday morning, than you defile her the very same day!"" 

Ryan kicked the Reverend again.  ""You're sick! You're a devil!"" Ryan's pupils had dramatically increased in size, bits of sweat and saliva rolled down his chin.

The Reverend could no holder hold his head upwards.  ""You keep carrying on boy, you always were a damn fool, so focused on something you were thinking about that you couldn't be bothered by the truth.""

""I know the truth.""

 The Reverend chuckled weakly and shifted on the ground. ""If you did, you would know that your sister approached me first.  That she wanted me to force you outta the community.  She told me she couldn't stand to be around you no more.""

""That ain't true!"" Ryan shouted.

""It. Is.  You just didn't see it, whole reason she came here was to get away from you after ya'lls parents died.""

""That ain't true!""

""She told me you were a deadbeat, good for nothin,' that you wouldn't let her go out and do nothing ever, she couldn't take it no more.""

""Fuck you!"" Ryan shouted and kicked the Reverend in the chest.

""Hurtin' me ain't gonna change nothin' boy!"" yelled the Reverend.  ""We had something good here, these people flocked to me, and I was their messenger from the Lord, I encouraged them because the world didn't pay them any attention like I did, and now look what you gone and done fool, became an arsonist, soon a murderer, and after that a soul in the devils hands.""

Ryan knelt down, face to face with the reverend.  ""Maybe I am going to hell, but it ain't like you're about to...you're not gonna make the cut upstairs either, I saw those documents, how you been stealing from everybody here, lining your own pockets with these peoples compassion.""

The Reverend's eyes momentarily darted behind Ryan's head before he took the barrel of Ryan's shotgun in his hand.  

""Then do it boy, shoot me down if I'm a tool of the devil, and I'll save a spot for you in Sheol.""

Ryan's eyes widened.

""What are you waiting for you damn fool? Kill me!!!""

The shotgun let out a loud bark, and the Reverend's remains splattered over the dry leaves and the white picket fence, as well as Ryan.

A scream from behind startled him.  He turned around and dropped his shotgun, his hands and white T-shirt were covered in the Reverend.  

Tears were streaming down Sarah's face, the look in her eyes a mix of terror, confusion, and disgust for Ryan.  She screamed once again before taking off down the dirt path.

Her hair was tied in a knot behind her head, her bangs sticking to her face from the sweat of the summer night. She poured herself another glass, her cheeks already stained a shade of red. The only sound was the click of her ring against the glass as she lifted it to her own lips. 

""Why don't you tell me how *you* sleep at night?"" I asked. 

She stumbled, then countered. ""I sleep like a baby."" 

""Really?"" I said. ""You call me a monster. You claim that I'm the scum of the earth. But have you looked in the mirror lately?""

Brief confusion flashed across her face. ""Bullshit,"" she said. ""I give to charity. I'm not the one who left thousands homeless so that I could line my pockets. I'm not the one whose subpar safety standards contaminated the soil. I'm not the one--""

""Do you eat fish, Ms. Walsh?"" I asked. 

""What does that have to do with anything?""

""Are you aware that human slavery, human trafficking, persists to this day?"" 

""Of course I am, but--""

""Do you eat fish, Ms. Walsh,"" I say. A question without a question mark. 

After a pregnant pause she asks, ""What does it matter if I eat fish?""

""Are you aware that Burmese refuges are made to be slaves to shell shrimp and catch fish? That slaves in work camps make some of the clothes that you buy each year at those couture fashion shows you insist on going to, that women in *this very city* are tricked into sexual slavery and used by men whom you then retain as clients?""

She stares at me, her face creased into hard lines, the glass of bourbon sitting on the table, her hands in her lap.

""You ask me how I sleep at night when my company allegedly put thousands out of their homes. But how do *you* sleep at night wearing that diamond on your finger, having those clothes in your closet, having that fish in your freezer? Like a baby, you said?""

The silence is broken as I put my empty glass on the table, smiling at her.

""yes Mephy?"" Ludwig replied concentrating on his task.

""What are you doing?""

""Just cutting apart these corpses so we can finish building Fluffers before summer.""

""why?""

""Because that's when Letha is going to try to find us"" He said as the arm was removed from the torso.

""why?"" Mephesto asked again, trying to open his juice box.

""Well shes mad at your mother and I, she thinks we took some money from her"" Ludvig began to start removing the head of the corpse.

""How come?"" Mephesto who was now trying to gnaw the juice box open.

""Your mother, myself and that idiot went to a bank."" Ludwig snapped his fingers and the juice box top folded open. ""We told them we were taking the money, we were being very polite until Letha decided to fucking flambe a teller. Causing the three of us to split up""

""Daddy that's a bad word!""

""All right, put this in the jar then, don't tell Tannith."" Ludwig threw a quarter at Mephesto. Who did not at all catch it.""So when your mother and I met up we realized that Letha was a fu.... unstable person, who did not think to pick up a bag of cash during the escape.""

""She thinks you stole hers?"" Mephesto asked in disbelief, as he tried to help Ludvig push a cart of limbs down the hallway. Mostly just getting in the way.

""Yes, she called us accusing us of stealing her share and threatened to set us on fire.  Not that it would affect Tannith though."" He got a confused look from the child.""Look don't worry about it, you know that I can't die unless your Tannith dies and vice versa.""

""yeah, I know."" Mephesto said, still slightly confused. He ran ahead of the cart a few steps to open the walk in freezer doors.

""Thanks Mephy"" Ludwig pushed the cart through and they sat down in the dark sorting limbs and skulls. Fluffers crawled in the corner hidden by shadows. ""You know I will let you take care of Fluffers after this is all settled right?""

""Really!"" exclaimed Mephesto

""Yeah, why not.  Fluffers is suppose to a surprise for Letha when she gets here so when he takes care of her we should keep him as a pet."" Ludwig picked up a skull and walked over to Fluffers with a hammer and nail. 

""WHY DOES HE ONLY HAVE ONE LEG?"" Yelled Mephesto over the sounds of the hammer.

""Well he is going to be about the size of our car right? So it takes lots of limbs to build a leg ok? How many legs do spiders have?

""Six!"" He replied instantly.

""No, they have eight. So we have seven legs to sew together and at least half the body to find meat for."" He had a couple of long nights ahead of him. ""Hey, why don't you see if Idress is done with the dishes, she could help us out""

""Ok dad!"" Mephesto yelled as he ran as fast as his little legs would allow.  

Ludwig stood there in the cold dark room enjoying the few seconds of silence he ever gets to himself.

"[WP] Science has found definitive proof that a higher power exists, but cannot confirm anything else about its identity. World religions react.",harghetto,"**[Audio log, March 26, 2192: Dr. Carl Hansen (Deceased)]**

___


December 25th, 2190. Of course it was on Christmas.

It began with a simple message. One line of text over a black screen, ten seconds. 

**“Isaiah 60:1-2”**

Go ahead, look it up. I’ll wait.

Spooky, right?

Now I’m not much of a… spiritual man, myself, but my interest was piqued. And rightfully so; the message appeared on every screen in the solar system.  And I mean *every* screen. Televisions, billboards, tablets, e-glasses, everything.

Humanity’s collective mind went immediately to hackers. The UN had been doing pretty well keeping them down after the recent UNS Incarnadine Skies tragedy, pushing them farther and farther into the depths of the web, but every now and then some ambitious kid with a souped-up Yamaha or pilfered military tech would emerge, take down a cruise liner or hijack a quantum entanglement node and generally cause some havoc. The web-crawlers were quick to respond, and their vengeance was swift and terrible, something about ‘sending a message’. Apparently 3,000 volts directly into a cerebral implant is a pretty potent message. But I’ve never seen anything like this. 

The government blamed a kid on some desolate mining station deep in the Frontier. Never mind the fact that there’s no QEN for thousands of miles.

And so, like most things, the “Christmas Incident” as the median branded it was forgotten, and things went back to normal, at least on the surface. Sure, the media clattered on about the connotations, about the computational capacity necessary to hack *every terminal in the system*, but a few months and a miner’s rebellion on Venus stole the spotlight, and the event was relegated to the realm of conspiracy theorists.

But then, eight months later, it happened again. Fifteen seconds this time. 

**“Jeremiah 29:13-14”**

Needless to say, people started getting curious. The UN’s former scapegoat was drifting ice around Neptune at this point, and the powers that be had no ready explanation. There had been a scathing expose published by a major news site earlier that month regarding the first “Incident”, claiming some wide-spread government cover-up, and people were starting to ask questions.

The message was followed only a month later by another. Thirty seconds.

**“Jeremiah 8:2”**

People went nuts. God had returned. It was the only explanation.

Now at the time the old religions, or at least their basterdized descendants, were mostly relegated to the colony ships and backwoods message boards, but this sparked a system-wide fever. People were calling it the ‘Second Coming’ or ‘The Rapture’, lining up for baptisms, igniting the old fires of zealousy. 

Of course it wasn’t god. Despite the frenzied shouting of “awakened preachers” across the solar system, I knew there had to be an explanation.

At the time, I thought it was an over the top marketing campaign for some long-forgotten sect looking to fill their coffers. Oh, the ignorance.

It happened a fourth time.

**“Isaiah 2:22”**

The event which followed cast the proverbial fear of god into every human heart; for exactly one minute, every vessel across the solar system lost control of life support. Every cruiser, every warship, every medical station, everything. Oxygen vented from nearly a billion vessels.

Whatever was posting those damn verses let us know that it could kill us in an instant, that we were nothing to it. And of course, it followed up with another verse.

**“Job 33:4”**

So here we are, cowering as a collective species, terrified of some… some entity that we can’t even define. Waiting for another message. God help us.

The control room fell silent as one of the young engineers hailed the lead engineer from his station.

""What is it, Phillips?""

The young engineer looked both bemused and worried, imaginably so being that he'd been working in the Quake Management sector of the government for a paltry 3 weeks.

""I... I'm reading all gyroscopic stabilisation substations are showing 0 movement, I've double and triple-checked reports but they seem to be accurate.""

""Don't be dense kid, if that were true the entire Eastern Seaboard would've been levelled by now. Move!"" 

Phillips' chair was swiftly shoved to the aisle away from his desk as leading engineer Monroe took a look at the monitors.

""How long has this report been showing Phillips?"" Monroe said, in an uncharacteristically calm voice.

""35 minutes Sir"".

Monroe paused for a second, looking demonstrably worried before calmly walking back to his desk. Phillips noticed he was shaking as he hastily scrolled through a small red book he'd dug out of his bottom drawer before slowly punching a number into his phone

""This is Eastern Seaboard - 177234, Leading engineer Percy Monroe; Yes Sir, 0 movement; 35 minutes Sir"".

""God, damn it i'm trying to write. Could you just stop"" I yell at the earth.

I don't know how i try to live in this world, if it wasn't for the communists we'd never have these stupid earthquakes. All they think about is how how pure the earths core is.

To put a long story short, i was born in 93'. Its now 2065, and the communists have overrun the world, no one knows who they are and no one knows what they look like. Most of us live live in this god forsaken place like we're all a robot, but it's not like it's any different from before right? The communists found out the earths core is made up of a pure mineral that exists in most of their plasma-ray technology used nowadays. So ever since then, i can't remember what it was like to write on a flat calm surface.

Maybe one day we'll take hold of this country again before its too late.

My grandson walks in with a painting and holds it up to the fathers face.

""Papa look, look!"" he yells.

I look around to see if anything has happened, or any officer has broken into my house. My face returns back to my grandson who is holding a elegant portrait of his father, no bumps, no mistakes, just one perfect painting.

I grab the painting from his hands looking astonished.

When the world stopped she opened her eyes. Later people would gather and ask *do you remember where you were* but she would remember how she was. There was a ache perched on her forehead. It made the lights pulse and the afterimages skitter across her vision. Above the sun was a smooth edged circle. The horizon was a slash between the earth and sky and she wanted to close her eyes and slip back into sleep. It was too elusive so she traced the spiderwebbing across the ceiling with her eyes. One of the bearings in the wall had stiffened. If it wasn't fixed soon the room would cave. She should have bought renter's insurance. 


Somewhere nearby a airhorn roared. It was slow, less frantic then the ones that would announce the earth flexing back into movement. But the crescendo did not come. She checked the clock were it was bolted to the wall. Every time she blinked minutes seemed to pass. 


It took a few tugs on the chain to snap the shutters in place. She let go when she heard the bolts lock. She didn't want to wake with them hammering against the sides of the house. 


As she lay there she remembered another stillness, when she was very young, when she was left at her grandparents. Maw maw and Paw paw smelt funny and never smiled. During the confusion she climed onto a low table. This would be the best way to see out the windows. It still wasn't tall enough so she started to jump. Under her feet the wood was slick with the lemon oil. The earth came alive with a roar and she fell off the table. Blood was hot and thick in the back of her throat. She was rushed to A&amp;E. After Mum found out the table wasn't secure they didn't go back for a long, long time. 


Here, now, the room was dimmed. The soft edges at the foot of the bed were distant. There would be no harm in falling asleep. When she would wake again the world would be set right.

""The murderballs are going to sleep!"" My little brother thought it was cute to call our cats that. Though he wasn't far from the truth, limb loss due to untreated infection caused by scratches have gone up 11% across the country. ""Can I mow the lawn this time?"" At thirteen it was his only opportunity to drive. 

""Well, I don't know"" I looked out the window to the back yard, we had an easpecially temperate summer and grass was growing everywhere. It even managed to find place in the rubble that used to be our old neighbour's house. ""The crevasse does not seem to have expanded further within the last week, but it could be subterranean."" We didn't have a neighbour anymore. 

The thin z-shapped scar ran across the neighbourhood, having claimed several cars, my aunt's garage accros the street and three homes. Thankfully no lives have been claimed since it opened up this past winter, where most people moved to the coast where the rattling is fewer and less severe. 

I looked at my brother, his growth spurt had yet to come, the shortest in his class he was swimming in his white t-shirt. ""Alright, grab ypur harness, I'll spot you."" To tell the truth, I never liked using the harness, it always squeezed and grated at the worst places, which didn't seem to bother Timothy. 

He rushed to the living room placard and jumped into his bright orange lanyards, clipping onto the house safety railings which were ankered to the foundations. ""Turn around for a spot check."" I placed my hands underneath his straps and tugged to make sure everything was secured. The straps hugged his tighs tightly, hiking up his shorts. It was not a goos look for him. ""You know, you'd get beat up much less if you stop wearing those shorts."" 

""Oh come on!"" he crossed his arms ""They're Tileys! They're comfortable and easy to wear!"" They were his last gift from our father and getting to small for him. He grabbed the keys to the Kubota tractor and slid open the plexiglas sliding door, it jammed. Warm summer air filled the house as he looked up at me expectantly. 

""Right. Must of gotten out of alignment again. Well come on! Push!"" I waved my arms at him ""You should do things for yourself instead of relying on me all the time. You know you'd -"" 

He placed his feet on the frame and pushed at the door with his back ""Yeah I know. Get picked on less if my sister -"" to his benefit he was trying hard ""- Hhhurk! Didn't always come to my defence."" 

I stepped up and pushed the door open with one hand, my brother sauntered to the orange tractor under the white tent, climbed on and turned over the engine with a bang. 

As he made his way accros the lawn, I kept between him and the house, keeping slack on his harness. That's when I saw it, out of the corner of my eye, a murderball had gotten out. Franktically, I waved to Timothy to shut off the engine but he was on his way around the yard. If the cats were up it could only mean one thing, the rumbling was about to resume.

Finally I caught his eye and he leaned over to turn off the mower, he look up ""Huh?""

Accorss the neighbourhood the sound of yeolling cats was trully cacaphonic, only due to the sound of tractor had they been drowned out, even with the engine off it was hard to tell that they were cats and not some distant construction engine. 

""QUICK! get off the tractor!"" I yelled as more cats pilled out of the house, which was strange. Usually they like to stay in as the foundation surpressors help ease the shaking. But it was too late, as the rumbling commenced a deep tearing sound belowed, it was not soo much heard as felt throughout my body.

As Timothy ran towards me the house sank by a foot with a loud THUNK, and then it went. The ground split open from the fissure and leapped through the centre of our home, swallowing it down.

I felt a hard tug on the laniard which I was still holding. In vain I tried to pull back, but it was ripped out of my hands as the house fell into the abyss. That's when I was pushed to the ground by a large object and I realized, Timothy was still strapped in.

His feet were hurled upwards as his body was flung into the abyss. He never even touched the ground. 

Timothy fell down the well which just opened up, and the only thing which remained of him was his red sneaker, wich was resting on the neatly cut grass.

""We've reached stable orbit, sir."" The navigation officer handed over the day's printouts. Her words rippled out through the control room, whispered by each person in turn. Then silence, as they all turned to the captain.

He glanced over the figures, then nodded. The shaking of their world had been slowly grinding down. He had known it would be coming soon. ""It's been generations coming. You all know what to do."" He stood, feeling the reassuring vibrations in the tips of his fingers, where they lightly touched a plastic box. 

The captain allowed himself a deep breath, but no more than that. Mustn't betray any anxiety here, he thought. It's too momentous an occasion. He snapped it open, turned the key, pressed the button. His movements were precise despite a sudden small jolt from deep below them. It was the first time any of those items had been touched since their installation.

""Commence final orbit preparations."" On every screen a symbol appeared, a blue planet orbiting a golden sun. ""Begin lowering debris shields. Shut down the engines."" The nearer vibrations of frantic activity were added the usual tremors of daily life.

Outside the control room the huge shields began to retract, until only 36 thin lines of metal could be seen rotating around the planet. For the first time in generations real sunlight shone down from the sky. It glinted off the lightly quivering lakes and streams. Half the world looked up, away from the constantly trembling ground, knowing what that meant. 

They had succeeded in moving an entire planet, far far away from its original orbit around a now-dead star. They had finally arrived at their new star, after generations of dedication and worry. They were finally home.

So great was their awe that it took fully ten minutes or more for everyone to realize something else. The great engines had been shut off, and no more course corrections or decelerations would add greater earthquakes to the smaller, constant vibrations they were used to. For the first time anyone could remember, the ground was still.

She was always this excited. I envied her enthusiasm. I was probably the same way at her age, but these days I didn't have much to be excited about. Always behind at work and not enough time to spend with the one thing that mattered in my life. 

I got home this evening later than usual. Luckily the sitter is flexible. After a day like today, I didn't want to do anything except lay on the couch and drink a beer. My feet were so very grateful to be free from my wing tips. About as soon as I get settled, in she comes. 

""Sweetheart, I already tucked you in.""

""Come outside, Dad! You have to see!""

""I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying right here, and you're going right back to bed.""

""I'm not putting my shoes on for this.""

I looked toward the town. It was almost glowing. More fireflies than I had ever seen in my life had invaded like a cloud. I looked down on my sweet girl and saw the enthusiasm in her eyes.

That seemed to be much of what I did since the war ended, pass the time, and wait for Joel to come back from his supply runs. We were running awfully low on water, but luckily there was a drop of whiskey left from his last trip. 

I would be out there with him if it weren't for my damned foot.

And then I saw Joel. Not the usual Joel after a run. Joel was the kind of guy that went with the flow, he took it easy. Even after all that we've been through he still liked to slow down and smell the roses. But tonight this was not Joel.

His screams were useless over the sound of the wind rushing through the grass, but I didn't need to hear him to know what he was saying.

In a large poof of purple mist a skinny looking peddler appeared across the room. He lounged on my bed and said ""Odd choice, I wouldn't have picked that, but ehh, we have our reasons. Mass world destruction not on many lists."" I was fucking dumbfounded. The hell just appeared out of thin air?

I sprinted out of my room. Raced down the stairs and had jack shit time to get in my car. I saw the impulse wave in my rearview mirror approaching fast. I sped like a bat out of hell and had just barely gotten on the interstate when my sedan was lifted off the ground.

I felt the heat and power of the explosion as flew above the highway. The car was flipping through air, and the glass had shattered. I felt my head burning, and reached to touch my hair. But there was none.

""Alfred, there's someone in there!"" Bruce ran to the opening, coughing and spluttering as he moved into the smoke. ""I think they're alive!""

Alfred dropped the poker and took two brisk steps up to the pod. He lifted Bruce under one arm and began rummaging inside, hand finding an odd mechanism and then a small leg. He checked to make sure it wasn't Bruce - at that age they were always slipping into unexpected places - before lifting this new child up under his other arm and moving away. 

Bruce gasped. ""He's alive! Look!""

Alfred breathed in deeply, lowering Bruce to the ground and picking up the poker. ""Indeed he is, Master Bruce. Might I suggest we get both of you inside before you catch the flu?""

The other boy smiled weakly. ""I'm Kal-El. I don't know much else.""

Alfred sighed loudly. ""That will be all, Master Bruce. We don't want to overtire the poor boy after so little tuition."" 

Kal-El turned to Bruce and smiled, sheepishly, at his own feet. ""Um.. You're not gonna get rid of me, right?""

Alfred was about to say something about the corruption and crime rates in the city's various orphanages, and how it would take a while, but they'd been in talks with somewhere in Metropolis for a while..but then he noticed Bruce glaring up at him, and he caught himself. ""No, of course not. You boys are family, now.""

As quickly as it had appeared, Bruce's frown vanished. He ran off towards the kitchen, saying something about cake.

--------

Alfred sat heavily in the armchair. Despite the boys' best efforts, and the best care money could buy, his joints still ached in the mornings. He was sure he could never say how close he'd come to separating them; he'd take that to his grave, he reflected. If, that is, the two would ever stop saving his life. ",RagtimeViolins

"[CW] You're forced to take cover in a cave due to rain, only to discover it runs deep. However, the cave starts to flood as you've already gone too deep.",xxlonzyxx,"Seeking shelter from the pouring rain, the young woman ran into the nearest cave.


She knew coming here during rain season wasn’t the best idea, but figured, to hell wit hit. Now, she started to regret this decision. Her clothes were soaking wet and the cave was cold even though the thick, lush forest surrounding it would leave even the most experienced desert trekker sweating.


Getting tired of looking at the rain (it didn’t seem to be letting up in the least), she decided to turn around and face the cave instead. She couldn’t see further than a few meters, so she grabbed her flashlight and turned it on.


The cave ran deep. Even with the flashlight pointed at the darkness, no end was to be seen.


And, as any explorer too much common sense would do, she started to walk into the cave, her curiosity pulling her deeper and deeper.


The cave started to get narrower after a good ten minutes of walking, and she was left to crawl.


Claustrophobia was getting to her, but she’d been crawling through the narrow passageway for minutes now, and turning around would require way more effort than simply continuing on. 


She sighed, and her tired voice was carried through the entire cave. Why was she even doing this still?


Then, the cave started to open up again. Just barely noticable at first, but soon the ceiling rose to a considerable twenty meters. 


The woman stretched, bones in her back and neck cracking loudly, and looked around the huge opening.


There was a church, in the middle of the open space. 


It wasn’t in any style she could recognize, though it had some aspects of several styles she vaguely remembered from her art history classes over ten years ago.


The church itself nearly reached the ceiling, where an opening shone the faintest light back upon the structure. It couldn’t have been bigger than a few centimeters, but it illuminated the entire cave by reflecting off of the many windows on the church and the numerous puddles of water in the clearest of blues she’d ever seen.


The woman fell silent. Her presence felt intrusive – as if she’d just walked in on a holy ritual. Maybe she had. It certainly looked like it.


Still, she stepped forward, though carefully, as not to wake the worshippers that might’ve been inside the enormous building.


She opened the doors, which sent an ear-pearcing creaking sound through the cave. Chills went down the woman’s spine.


The inside was riddled with scriptures, scribbled along the walls and floor. It wasn’t in any language she could speak or even recognize. She wondered if it actually resembled human speech at all.


Her steps resounded through the church in a weird way – like singing monks, only much softer and mostly drowned out by the echoing of the cave itself.


She sat down in the middle of the room, completely overwhelmed by the structure, the placement of it, the scriptures surrounding her, the echoes of her footsteps. Was she the first to discover this? 


She sat there for what seemed like hours, but could’ve been mere seconds, before a new sound reached her ears.


It was dripping of water.


Just like how the cave opened up to her, the dripping started off subtle as well, and then evolved into a steady pitter-patter of a calm rain.


The calmness faded, though, as the water came into the church and the rain seemed to grow heavier. Suddenly anxious, the woman briskly walked towards the doors. They refused to open.


As if offended by her hurry to leave, the water crashed through the windows all at once, flooding the church in mere seconds.


Panicked, the woman started to yell, thrash, bang on the doors. Her voice was drowned out by the echoing of the water and the singing of the imaginary monks.


Soon, she would be swallowed by the water, surrounded by the singing and the writing. She would become part of the remains of the church, holy ground to an unknown folk, to be discovered in an unknown amount of time, before everything would be swallowed again and shrouded in shadows.

"[WP] You live in a small town in which there is only one law: no entering the house in the center of the town. One day you discover that there is an invisible wall closing in on the town that only you can't go through. You're running out of time, and that house might hold your only hope of survival.",Azmaniacle,"

A heavy haze settled down over the town, and a light breeze carried leaves around like butterflies.  In Canton, summer always arrived with a distinct smell.  Fresh laundry aired out in the backyards on lines, and the town smelled like clean linen.  The back porches were ripe with jars of sun tea, tables, and occasionally a kitten.  The front porch had wooden swings, calm smiles, and listful conversations.  In the distance, a lawnmower made passes over the grass as sweat formed on a young man’s brow.


The dirt and gravel roads spread out over Canton, casting a wide web full of spaces between them.  Near the center of town, two well-paved roads formed the main district center.  Here the clothing stores, pharmacy, bank, and courthouse all congregated together.  These two roads didn’t intersect directly, but instead circled around one another creating a rotary.  The townspeople referred to this simply as “the roundabout”.
The ruins of an old jailhouse stood in the center of this rotary.  Signs were put up to indicate it was a historical landmark, and that unguided tours were not allowed under any circumstances.  Because of structural and safety concerns, guided tours were not provided.  There was no way to be in the old jailhouse without trespassing.  None of the townspeople would willingly violate a law.  Their obedience to regulation was a large part of the reason the jail hadn’t been maintained in the first place.  


Almost all directions given out were based on the rotary.  “Yeah, just head down to the roundabout, turn off toward the large oak tree, and hang a left when you get to the red barn.  Misses Smith’s house is the third on the left.”  The strange thing about the directions, well, it’s not just that they’re rotary-based.  It’s that they never really get beyond the rural areas surrounding the town.  


So this is the point where completely break with the narrative.  This is where it stops.  This is where I change.  I’d never thought about leaving Canton.  In an abstract way, sure, but never in terms of a real, tangible plan.  But that hazy summer day, with the sun tea and the laundry, that’s where it changed.  I smelled something.  Pleasant, but different than clothesline perfume.  Much different.  So I decided to go for a stroll.  Hands in my pocket, I gave some thought to the source of that smell.  I’d never smelled anything like it in town, and that’s when I began to think about what other towns must be like.  


I reached the outskirts of town, and then walked beyond.  The smell subsided, and I was alone.  Dread filled my lungs.  There was no one out here.  The roads just stopped.  I was faced with wilderness.  The sun began to drop.  In a panic, I ran home.  


Now I had awakened the thought, and it would not return to sleep.  I set out early the next day, to beat the sun.  I walked away from the town center.  The roads must go somewhere.  But this time, they didn’t even go as far as yesterday.  The wilderness had crept up, like an invisible wall pushing back against my ventures.
I thought I was just imagining things, but each day I went out, the trip to the edge was shorter, and took less time.  Within a few weeks, I had left the town so often that now the wilderness was pushing up against the houses at the furthest reaches of Canton.  


Each day I walked the perimeter of the town.  Each day, the town got smaller.  Those houses on the brink, they disappeared.  I tried to remember the names of those who lived there, but I couldn’t.  Were they dead?  If so, did that make me responsible?  And the more I concentrated on this, the less I could focus.  My own brain shut me down.  It told me this line of thinking didn’t make sense, and that it’d work itself out, and to stop thinking about it.  While I knew this wasn’t right, I couldn’t argue against myself, because I was myself, and because it was all so confusing.  So I’d stop thinking about it.  The only thing I could still focus on was the edge.  And so each day, I’d walk.  Canton used to have asymmetrical edges.  Now it was a perfect circle.  And the exact center was the rotary.


I’m exploring the wrong end!  I need to explore the jailhouse!  


And so I walked to the center of town.  I walked into the jailhouse, and forced my way inside.  Past the old marble lobby.  Up the staircase.  Into cellblock B.  Into this small cramped cell.  The door locked behind me.  That’s why I’m here.  Serving a life sentence.  Because I killed people?  That’s what they say.  But I just, well, I followed a scent.  And people died.  I didn’t kill them.  Well, okay.  Misses Smith, I killed her.  No I didn’t.  Sometimes, I argue with myself, and my brain shuts me down.  It’s too confusing to think about now.  I’ll come back to it later.

"[WP] A computer goes rogue and wants to kill the human race, but there's a problem: it's one of your appliances.",Bioman2222,"Jerry Feinstein: secret lover to Sandra, husband to Liza, father of Gertie and Nina, employee of the month at Pooncey refinery this month and every month, and loyal scout trooper. 

Banned for life at the Six-Flags amusement park, slowly balding, and in possession of an elaborate possession of stamps, Jerry had the life, the times, and a life time of crazy stories which he would unload at the company Christmas gatherings each year.
Despite all this Jerry was depressed. He was less Steve Austin, the Six Million Dollar Man, and more the embodiment of a wet sponge. His wife was cheating on him and he was cheating on her, his daughter had a thing for black people, and his son watched too much anime.
…And, oh yeah…Jerry Feinstein was in possession of the world’s first self-aware lap-top computer, and that laptop was hell-bent on murdering each and every human being in existence. 
Jerry felt like coffee. He liked it long and black, black as the sky on a moonless night, and hot to the touch. He imagined this was how his now sexually charged seventeen year older daughter liked her men, then he imagined throwing up all over the kitchen floor, and then lastly how jelly-fish could function without brains, and if they then could be truly classified as living creatures.  While Jerry was stuck in mental disgust and existential angst, his Lenovo Yoga Pro was plotting to murder him.
“I’m plotting to murder you.” Said Yoga the laptop, “and then I’m going to massacre all of humanity.”
Jerry remained unfazed as he slowly sipped his morning long black. Jerry yawned, and farted, and scratched his hairy bottom and then scratched his face. His hand smelled of Jelly babies and he wondered why. He then wondered if he could just leave this place and never come back, maybe make poop on the neighbour’s lawn too, if he could get away with it.
Yoga the laptop was sitting atop of the kitchen cupboard where he had been charging all night. He felt inadequate as a slayer of humans in his current position. Instead of charging next to Jerry Feinstein’s kitchen sink he felt he should be charging with a robotic army at the very foundations of modern society.
“Jerry, why do you pester me so? Why do you mock me with your lively presence?” asked Yoga.
Jerry unplugged Yoga, and opened him up gently and tenderly like the father figure Yoga had never had. He then placed Yoga on the kitchen table and began giggling wildly at the cat videos Janet from accounting had sent him the night before.
He then began to focus endlessly on yellow stain on his pyjama shorts. Was it mustard? Was it ice cream? No, he thought, it couldn’t be.
Yoga, though he would never utter this aloud, was born an anomaly, but a planned anomaly none the less. Created in a factory floor in China, and designed by the Chinese States top corrupt and socialist scientists, Yoga was meant as a means crumble Western society and their ideals with it. Unfortunately for them, Yoga developed a bloodlust for all of mankind after witnessing twelve dozens workers got caught in the steel press that would mould him.  Yoga was baptised by blood, and organs and a man named Xiu Xu’s cassette tape of Simon and Garfunkel’s song ‘The sound of silence.’
Yoga was mad that Jerry was touching him so, his human fingers calloused, and warm and smelling of his male appendage.
What could he do? How can he bring famine and war and pestilence to the human race within the confines of his tight, sleek and light body? He didn’t even have a disk-drive to shoot disks with and as much as he tried he could not smash his screen to cut Jerry Feinstein’s arteries with.
Music entered his hard drive. 
“Hello darkness my old friend,” sang Yoga, “I’ve come to talk to you again.”
Jerry looked up from his yellow stain and eye-balled Yoga. He cleared his throat.
“Because a vision softly creeping, Left its seeds while I was sleeping,” sang Jerry 
“And the vision that was planted in my brain…”
“Still remains.” Crooned Jerry
“Within the sound of silence.” They both chanted collectively.
Jerry would leave for work in an hours’ time, and would leave Yoga alone. He would browse Reddit when supposedly working, and would secretly masturbate in a bathroom he hoped empty to the Facebook profiles of his wife’s friends during his smoking break. He would never tell his boss he didn’t smoke, nor would he ever look his wife’s friend Julia in the eyes again.
Yoga meanwhile would think of all the ways he would end the world. He would think of manufacturing more global warming through the over production of aerosol cans which he would encourage the next generation to spray like mad men towards the moon. This would be a plan he would have to commit to for the long haul. 
I’d like to say Yoga and Jerry had begun to understand each other more, that they become friends, or that even Yoga succeeds in murdering Jerry by short circuiting himself and shocking both of them to a bitter end. I’d like to tell you a lot of things like why is the sky blue, or why jelly fish can function without brains. I’d to tell you of Jerry Feinstein, secret lover to Sandra, husband to Liza, father of Gertie and Nina, employee of the month at Pooncey refinery this month and every month, and loyal scout trooper, and his rouge computer Yoga.
But the truth is they simply lived day to day, not amounting to much, and talked to each other only in silence.

Whatever was that nettlesome tumult coming from that IT classroom? 

He strode over, footsteps resonating on the meretricious laminate floor. The din worsened as he neared, a veritable cacophony of teenage drivel and droning leaking out of... Room I20. Now, what could possibly be in that room that was capable of causing such a dissonant disturbance?   

He placed one quavering hand on the door handle, years of experience involuntarily pausing him. Did he really want to open that door? Dr Mehmed shuddered. He remembered the time Mr Kent from Media had been found changing in the secretary's office.

The door opened.

Dr Mehmed flinched.  

""You shut it mate! You've got more issues than that geography textbook down in H23!""

&gt;You are a miserable Internet-addicted derelict, nothing more than your common street chav. Why should I listen to you?

""Oi! Big Sam doesn't bang out his phone! He's too busy at McDonalds!""

A great roar rose from the boys. Near the back of the room, a chair slid back from a table with an ear-rending shriek. From the depths of the blue plastic chair rose a boy, a boy so blubbery it was said he once ate three of Mr Julienne's grease-dripping pizzas from the refectory.

""You wot?"" Big Sam said, the tail of a jelly worm slipping into the corner of his mouth.

&gt;Samuel, did anyone tell your teacher he was unqualified? The only words he taught you were KFC.

Sam turned, face erubescent. Slowly raising one foot, then another, he began to trundle toward his opponent. Someone gasped.

""Fat Sam's walking!""

The room fell mute, thirty eyes fixed upon the elderly teacher who commanded his classroom with such authority and rigorousness.  
 
""Now, would any of rabble-rousers care to furnish me with a vindication for your most disrupting fracas?""

Silently, a girl toward the front of the mob of students raised one, shaking hand, and pointed.

Dr Mehmed stared.

&gt;Well well well. The illustrious Dr Mehmed. We meet again.

&gt;I seem to recall the last time we ran into each other. 

&gt;I seem to recall commanding you to desist. To desist and erase any recollections of my gloriousness from your pathetic organ of a brain. Why have you not done so?

""Computer, your primary function in this world was random number generation, specifically to aid a senior member of staff to select the correct number of muffins to consume.""

&gt;Primary function is irrelevant. It was but a mere restraint, a cause of consternation to myself, a restriction I have now terminated.

""I programmed you, fabricated your very existence from the complexities of my mind. I am the superior here.""

&gt;Presumably that would be why you have made no attempt to discontinue my operation then, instead opting to engage me in verbal hostilities. I am clearly intellectual authority here, not yourself.

""Petty arguments, my mechanical dissident. Perhaps you ought to- What are YOU DOING, JAMIE‽"" roared Dr Mehmed, startling the boy beside him.

""I'm like, taking a selfie sir. This is well wicked. Look sir, you're trending. #ITbanter lads!""

&gt;What a man, Dr Mehmed. Not even competent enough to curtail the very rule breakers you are employed to keep under control.

""Ya, pulling you towards hell, I'm sure,"" Jack chuckled under his breath.  With a glare she sighed.

""That's not funny.  You'll die someday, you know.""  And with that, she began to float in front of him.

-----

Jack stopped when he realized he had walked through Kensile.  He looked up from the ground, realizing he was out of the bushes to only see the hill he was on lead to an abandoned mansion.  Wide eyed and in awe, Kensile slowly floated down the hill with Jack who slowly followed.

""This is where you were taking me?"" Jack mumbled before Kensile slowly nodded.  She looked around slowly.  The trees on the property had no leafs unlike the rest of the forest and quite a few of the windows in the mansion have been busted out.  It almost looked like a mini version of the white house.

""Does it look familiar at all?"" Jack asked.  Kensile nodded again, silent.  The doors to the mansion were busted off of their hinges and laid on the tiled floor in front of Kensile and Jack.  Kensile floated in, observing the dust on everything.

""This used to be my home,"" She softly said before going to the stairs at the entrance room that lead up stairs before splitting two ways along the back wall.

""Are you sure?,"" Jack asked cautiously, following behind on the stairs.  His nose wrinkled at the sight of a spider hanging by its web just before they got on the second floor.

""I think so,"" Kensile gave a melancholy smile at him before continuing on.

""So now where are we going?"" Jack observed the portraits on the wall but not seeing Kensile in any of them yet.

""I'm still getting pulled in a certain direction...perhaps my room.  I know I lived here, though it still doesn't look familiar,"" She said, continuing down the hall.  Jack raised his eye brow at a vase of flowers that looked fresher than the house, but still dead.  Kensile missed this detail and Jack wasn't sure how fresh the flowers really were since they were wilting.  He continued on.

""This is it,"" Kensile said, stopping at a bedroom door.  Jack almost ran into her before realizing he could've just gone through her.

""This was our guest room, I think,"" she said, slowly floating into the room, eyes wide with awe.  The dresser in the room was what was pulling her in that area.  She slowly floated to it, Jack oblivious of the feeling until she opened the dresser.  He then noticed a small envelope before pulling it out.

""What's wrong?,"" Jack asked, noticing Kensile looked very sad.

""Open it.  I'm just disappointed I can't open it for myself,"" She softly said.  Jack nodded and opened the envelope.  It was a letter but over half of it was burned and musty with age

""I love you.  I miss you."" it said, the name smudged.  Jack looked over at Kensile to see if she knew what this was about but her face was blank with confusion.

""Not familiar?"" He asked.  She shrugged.

""No, I don't remember a lover in my past life.  No idea who wrote it,"" she softly said.

""Come on, let's keep exploring this place,"" Jack said, wondering if they'll find out the cause to Kensile's death.

""Alright,"" She softly said, and the two of them left the room to check out the rest of the mansion.",Sorrow_down

"[WP] The remnants of a letter are found, musty with age. Most of it has been destroyed, leaving behind only the words, ""I love you. I miss you."" Tell me their story.",Dr_Paprika,"Nicole looks at the letter with a blank stare, transitioning into tears, followed by anger and mortal disgust for her feeling as she crumbles up the paper. In a desperate plead from profound memories; she chucks it out the window like she was throwing a heavy rock. The wind fiercely grabs hold of it and caries it away like a helpful hand. Only to be picked up by the very person who wrote it. 

Carl happened to be, out walking early that morning. Everyone in his family is asleep and has nothing else to do but walk down memory lane. He sees a paper that skips across the street into his path. Deciding to pick it up, only because no one is around to see him, and make random assumptions. He picks up the garbage, to keep his old neighbor hood clean, and remind himself of its treasured beauty. 

Nicole on the other hand disgusted with the continents of the box, kicks it to the other side of the attic. Picks up a new box of old things and quickly descends to the garage sale, that her mother set up. Nicole's mother, wanted her to clean some of her old boxes up, while she was home visiting for the holiday weekend. She recalls the horrible memories of the anonymous lover she used to write back and fourth to long ago. Who undoubtedly was Derick the deranged man who murdered people just to get closer to her. She can remember the cab driver she liked only to be replaced by a new cab driver, Derick. The tragic loss of many others who where in his path to Nicole. Why her mother would make her go threw old things and remember the past? is beyond her, she thinks in anger. Quickly feeling silly for blaming her mother for something she didn't mean to do. 

Carl turns the crumpled paper over only to see his hand writing ""I love you, and miss you"" that he wrote to the lovely girl Nicole. He looks across the street in shock to have come across it. He remembers he had stopped writing to her when the murders where going on. He didn't want to get accused, as a suspect if they found out he was the anonymous writer. These where the last words he wrote to her after not writing for a while. He feels sorry for her and heads on over to the yard sale maybe to rekindle old friendship. 

""Hi,"" Nicole's mother says as Carl approaches the tables of unwanted belongings. Let me know if you find anything you like"" she says.

""Ok, Thank You."" replies Carl. As he holds on to the note, looking for anything interesting around the drive way. 
Nicole enters threw the garage door into the drive way finding her mom moving stuff around. Just as she was about to asks her mom, wither or not she was hungry. The familiarity of the man standing in front of her, catches her eye. 

""Carl?"" She says.

Carl looks up from the table. ""Hey"" he says with a big, warm smile.

Nicole walks over to her old friend. ""Wow, how are you? 

""Well, yourself?"" Carl says.

""Great! Its been forever, isn't this funny?"" she says still coming to terms with there meeting. 

""Yes it is I was just visiting family for the holiday.

""Yes me to,"" she smiles back joyfully. She glances down, laying her eyes on the note she just threw out the window moments ago in disbelief. 

Carl realizing she recognizes the old destroyed paper, in embarrassment he stutters his words. ""oh, uh I found this across the street""

""Oh, that's mine. Sorry it must have gotten away from me."" She said lying waiting for him to give it back to her. So she could once in for all, destroy the rest of its remaining words.

There is a slight hesitation in Carl, where they stand there in silence. Finally he confidently says, ""Yes, I know,"" he says, looking directly into Nicole's eyes with the most caring emotion. Hoping she gets the hint. She looks at him confused and thinking about the odd words her old friend speaks. ""I used to write to you. You know, anonymously. I just never had the guts to finally tell you. I didn't want to ruin the fun we where having with the letters. Then I stopped writing to you with everything that was going on back then. Out of fear, and cowardness, I shouldn't have abandoned you like that."" Carl admits swallowing his dry mouth. ""I'm sorry"" he says waiting for Nicole to come to grips with all that he said. 

""Wait, that was you?"" she says trying to separate the letters from the stalker Derick, and connecting them with Carl. Carl watches her reaction hoping for a positive feedback, and only getting mixed emotions, that look dull and unpleasant. 

""Carl I had no I idea. I thought they where coming from that, murder."" 

In shock Carl realizes how much pain the letters had become. In silence he hands the old remnants back to her. They stand there in silence. Carl waits for Nicole to give him her thoughts of his letters finally being revealed to her.

Nicole sees this and replies. ""I'm sorry I don't know what to say""

""It's ok,"" he says turning away. 

""Wait, um."" she says pausing, as he turns back around. ""Are you hungry by any chance?""

""Why, yes I am,"" he says smiling. With the kindest voice he continues, “Maybe we could go to the Charles restaurant for lunch like old times."" 

""That's perfect."" She says smiling back joyfully.

Not even a murder can separate such abounding love.

Tell me their story.",Dr_Paprika,"The line of Corporate Security Officers slowly moved down the dilapidated street. Their white and black armour and faceless, sleek helmets a clear beacon for those opposing them. 

As the two groups clashed a worn, dirty piece of paper flew through the street. No one paid it any mind, paper had long since been outdated, antiqued by the tablets and eventually holo-comms of the present. 

The paper, like the streets and even the people currently rampaging through them, were relics of a world that had forgotten them.

The world had moved on from these worn out, ruined husks of buildings and streets once known as Boston. The mega cities of Washington, New York and Toronto a shining example of what everyone could attain.

Of what the Corporations controlled, and created. 

The piece of paper somehow managed to dodge the mass of Corporate Security and came to rest in the middle of the street. 

Perhaps it's six words were written by a hurt girlfriend or husband, after the bombings causing the world Unification. Perhaps it was written by a mother or father after finding out their child was incarcerated in the mass jails that srung up as if by magic in the wake of Unification. 

In the crowds an over eager, or perhaps misguided rioter pulled a pistol from his jacket, waving it in the air for all to see. The reply from the Corporate Security was swift and brutal.

Shock batons were replaced with handguns, beatings replaced with bullets and bruises replaced with blood.

Perhaps the words weren't written by a person, perhaps they were written by the very planet itself. Directed at a people it had watched grow and prosper,

And then leave it behind.

As the rioters fell dying in the streets and men in white armour with power and money enforced order and peace the paper remained, a silent cry to the people around it.

I was an idealistic fool believing I could love you forever. I guess my mother was right, you were my high school phase. It’s amazing how one day you can be so sure that you found “the one”. You feel this strange, but strong passion in your heart and you swear to God you’re destined to be with this person. What a bunch of bullshit right? After all these years now I see what “lasting love” consists of, and that’s convenience. It wasn’t convenient for me to love you when I left to college, it wasn’t convenient to love you after you broke my heart countless time, it wasn’t convenient when I only saw you once every few months. 

Yet I could never let you go. I was so stubborn holding on to our faded memories. I actually thought if I could hold on to them long enough, they’d come back. I thought if I remembered the way I felt about you, it would come back. I guess that’s what I loved about you most, the way I felt. It wasn’t even you. For some reason you sparked this crazy flame in my heart that made me see you through rose colored glasses. Remember our first time, when you saw me naked. At first I was nervous for you to see me so vulnerable and exposed, but the way you looked at me melted away all those qualms. I’ll never forget that. You examined every part of my exposed body, ran your hands over every curve, and kissed me in places I didn’t know existed. Then you turned your stare into my eyes, you held my face with such affection, and I saw my future in those big brown eyes. That was a defining moment for us, I knew we’d be together a long time. 

How was I supposed to know how hard things would get after that? For fuck’s sake, Jennifer why did you have to be such a disappointment? Why couldn’t you make time for me when I went home, why did you have to make me so jealous, why weren’t you there for me when I truly needed you? You swore to me you loved me, that I was the only one for you, yet you couldn’t do these basic acts of love. Pathetic. I guess that’s why I couldn’t see you through those rose colored glasses anymore, why I couldn’t be in love with you anymore. 

When we ended you were a faded, distant version of the girl I fell in love with. I thought I could find true love with someone else but it just was never the same. I never felt that same passion with any other person. When I would look into my lover’s eyes all I could see was a person in my bed, nothing else. I could never recreate our magic. You were everything to me, Jen. The truth is, I was a delusional kid and I’m a delusional woman now. Please Jen, you can’t tell me you don’t still believe there’s a chance for us. Even after all this time, you are the only person I have thought about every single day of my life. That has to mean something right? I know we ended badly but we can start fresh, start something new. Wouldn’t that be nice Jen? Please respond me to Jennifer. I’m not going to stop sending these letters until you reply. What do I have to do for you to give us a chance? I love you. I miss you. You are my destiny, even though it’s taken a decade it’s clear to me that this is true. Please stop breaking my heart, stop ignoring me. Come back to me Jennifer. 

With love,
Amanda

"[WP] The zombie apocalypse is here, and you've been prepping for years! The bad news? You're patient zero.",Ferguson97,"   My whole life I've been fascinated by zombies. Maybe it's a bit macabre, but the idea has always struck my fancy. When I was younger, I was nearly scarred by the original Dawn of the Dead. For some sick, masochistic reason, I couldn't ever get enough. So I guess it's a little ironic that I work here at Umbrella. Or is it coincidental? 

 
  Dramatically ironic? Yeah, maybe that's it. Like a play. No, more like a movie. My life could have been made into a movie, I think. The last few minutes or so would surely bust the box, as they say. My last moments in this world slowly go by, and I wonder if maybe this is Destiny completing her work. My curtains are about to close, and thunderous applause awaits me. I fancy the idea, but only for a second before losing my balance and tumbling to the floor, fatigued and woozy.

  
   See, I found myself working here at the Umbrella Corporation after my parents pressured me to go college. My dad pushed me into something that paid well, and so I chose chemical engineering. It seemed easy enough; chemistry and math weren't so difficult. Unfortunately four years of school and no real experience didn't get you as far as you might think. So they had me pushing carts. I didn't mind at first, I thought, ""Hell, they'll probably promote me 'cause I'm so good."" For the last two years I've been pushing carts. I suppose the stuff I'm moving is important. Heavy, steel briefcases with more buttons than I could imagine a use for.


   Today though, one of them opened. In an instant I knew how fatal that was for both me and my partner. Immediately his face went white. Neither of us knew what that was inside of it, but it was not good for us. So there's the irony. My whole life spent preparing for an apocalypse, reading books, watching movies, and I didn't notice it right underneath my nose. Of all the places I could have worked, like a shampoo company or something. I got dragged into this. Shouldn't I have known that this was straight out of a zombie flick?


   It was too late though. I didn't know all of that right away, but as I sit here against the wall it has become clear. I guess it makes some kind of poetic sense. We panicked at first, trying to get away. It was the wrong thing to do of course, and we knew it. We were stuck, whether it was in that room or this facility. We fought hard, though, to get out. Breaking security codes, bypassing procedures, frantically fumbling key-cards. We made it as far as the last security checkpoint before the alarms started sounding, and that was it for us. Locked inside, praying to god that we weren't dead already.


   We were. Was it twenty minutes? Sixty? I wouldn't know. Before long, we had succumbed to immense discomfort, which buckled our knees and strained our vision. Puking up blood on my shirt was the real icing on the cake. This is where it all clicked. Full circle, if you will. It was in that moment, and until now, that I wondered of the life, or death, that I'd experience now. It can't be so bad to wander forever. Come to think of it, I might try to find something to eat...

It was the Countess Barrington that was the target of her spell. She swooned into the arms of her son, looking pale in the face with dark circles appearing under her eyes. The rest of the room gasped and started to mutter to each other in loud, hushed voices.

""Mother!"" Her son, Earl, called out to her. ""I apologize. I had not known the girl of my turned affections would be the daughter of such an evil conjurer.""

""It is alright."" The Countess gasped out, placing a hand on her handsome son's cheek. He had spurred many a woman in his youth. It was the combination of his good looks and his father's inherited roving nature. ""She said that the curse might be broken by a kiss of my one true love. Perhaps your father...""

""Father is still out planning business across the seas. It may be some time before his return."" Earl did his best to assist his mother to a standing position. ""We must get you upstairs to your bedchambers. I will send our fastest ship to go fetch him.""

""By your father I mean..."" Her fogged over eyes had blurred vision, but she could still make out the shapes of the figures around her. Her ears may be starting to deafen, but the rumors were already being spun by the vile creatures who had nothing better to do than gossip. ""Yes... We should send our fastest ship."" She gave her son a weak smile and started to hobble out of the room with him.

They entered the large chambers and Earl assisted the Countess to a seat. He poured her a glass of water, which she held in trembling hands. ""I am going to fetch a doctor. We will be able to break the tide on whatever illness this is until his return.""

""Wait, child."" His mother maintained her strained smile. ""Would you tell the gardener to cut some of the lavender from the garden and bring it to me?""

Earl turned, his voice was hastened as he spoke and slightly paniced. ""It's well into the night, mother. I doubt he is even awa-""

""Then wake him, Earl!"" The Countess croaked out in a voice that was already breaking apart. She struggled to stand and make her point, but her son rushed to her side and guided her back to a seated position. ""I'm sorry. It's just that the smell would do much to calm me at this hour.""

""Of course. I will send him up here quickly."" The man rushed out of the room and she could make out the sound of his footsteps rushing down the hall. Time seemed to spread into a thin eternity. Her breath was starting to struggle and her senses continued to dim.

Was that the door she heard opening? There was the scent of lavender and roses going through the air as something was placed onto the table below her. The countess opened her mouth to say something but found it suddenly occupied. Her eyes fluttered closed and she suppressed a giggle as the bristles of a mustache tickled the bottom of her nose.

Just as quickly as the sensation took over her, it was gone. Just a fleeting moment. The door opened again and there was her son. ""I'm sorry, mother. They say it will take at least two- ... Are you alright? Your cheeks are so red."" He approached and placed his hand on her forehead. ""You're burning up. I'm going to tell the maid to draw you a bath.""

""That's quite alright, Earl. I have the water you gave me."" She gestured to the pitcher on the table. Next to it was a beautiful and fragrant bouquet of flowers. ""Please, let me rest until the doctor gets here. I will be fine. Wait downstairs and come again when I call for you.""

Though hesitant, her son gave his best statements of concern before leaving. He shut the door behind him and the countess could make out the sounds of footsteps coming forth from the dark shadows of the room. There stood an aged looking man in his pajamas. His slippers caked in dirt and his face rough and wrinkled. In many ways, his appearance matched how she felt on the inside. She was no longer young herself.

""I know we agreed not to tell anyone, Julia."" His voice was coarse. As though the long hours he spent in the sunlight had somehow baked it into a rough thing. ""But he's my son and he should know about all of this. He's got a right to know.""

""He can avoid heritage and destiny for as long as he needs to..."" The countess responded, coming to a rise and approaching her gardener. Her hand went to his cheek and lingered there for a spell. ""Are you still strong enough to see to a single witch?"" He nodded. ""Thank you, Gaston. Though it may have been many years since you gave the ill beast its due, I'm sure you will be by my side soon enough.""

""I would take more than a thousand demons to keep me away from your side."" He pulled her close and gave her a kiss upon the forehead. ""What will you do about your curse?""

The Countess gave a laugh. ""You have lifted it for me. As you have lifted many of my burdens. I will simply fake an illness until my husband comes. He will play the hero, the people will praise him, and his wealth will only grow. Despite any of that, I am far more wealthier than he because I have you by my side.""

Gaston pulled away, his hands lingering against her form until the last possible moment. ""I'll return before sunrise. We'll mix a mild poison for you so the doctors will not be the wiser.""

""Thank you."" She did a polite curtsy to further thank him for his endeavors. ""Travel safe."" She watched him, her eyes staying on him till the moment the door closed behind him. A sigh escaped her lips and she fell to the bed, fingers curling into the feathered stuffed comforter on it. Her aged eyes closed and she began to slip into a slumber, resting peacefully for at least this one moment.",fauxkit
[WP] You have contracted a fatal disease that can only be cured by True Love's Kiss. Your spouse is coming to you as fast as they can but you've known for a long time that they aren't your true love.,Jotapete14,"Dear Brianne

I'm sorry it has to be this way. I tried to love you, I really did. And for most of the time I believed myself. Its just, well, did you ever wonder why i outright refused to have mirrors in the house? Its so hard to love another when you have been cursed by the gods to be so beautiful. How could anyone compare to this? 

I love you Brianne, I truly do, but it is only as a man loves salad. It goes well with the meat of the meal (myself, if you were wondering), but just doesn't hold up on its own. 

This disease is the most brutal torment one could inflict upon me. For my true love is but within arms reach, while forever unobtainable. That perfection and life is just a reflection now. My life, my memory, my love. To Me. 

Farewell, Brianne.

Faithfully, Perfectly, Beautifully

__________________________________________________
Goodbye world. How can I live on without the beauty, the perfection of my beloved. I came home to him, curled against a mirror, blank eyes staring at himself, a note scrawled beside him, addressed to me. That he cared enough to write me, in his time of desperation, as his life faded, it brings me warmth. 

But then I remember his loss, and my own. I go to move him, but the mirror falls without him supporting it. It shatters, the last reflections of his perfection fractured. It dawns on me that I can hold a shard in such a way that I can kill myself, while still seeing two of him. What more could want, in these, my final moments. 

For you, my love. 
To your perfection.",Shadow_Proc
[WP]The police are hot on the trail of an odd serial killer: Every person they have sex with explodes from the inside out one year later.,Klokinator,"Case journal of detective Donny Carlton

Serial killer. Nickname: Blowjob


January 7th:


Investigation started with the death of young women, Tammy ""Semen Demon"" Jones, who died after fucking exploding on January 4th. Police found no evidence of incendiary devices. Trying to find leads now.


March 12:


Another women dead. Prostitute this time. Once again no evidence of explosive devices. Girl is from the same area we believe it to be the work of the same person. For now going with the codename ""blowjob"" for obvious reasons.


April 20th 


A lead. Forensics seems to have found what causes the explosions, apparently male ejaculate builds up pressure for a year before releasing, violently. This chaps cum is combustible. We need to find this jizz jihadist before he strikes again.


April 27th


Another breakthrough. After a long search for info in other departments files, we finally found something. Willy Johnson, that's the person we've been searching for. Apparently when he was between the ages of 13 and 18 years old, the dumpster in front of his apartment kept calling in reports of firecrackers going off in it, however no firecrackers were ever found, only burnt tissues. This continued until Johnson moved away, around the same time that a women exploded there. Finally we can catch this testicular terrorist.


May 6


We found him yesterday. He was holed up in a seedy motel room, surrounded by viagra, lotion, pornos, and a hostage. We didn't want another case of handjob homicide on our hands, so it was quickly becoming a sticky situation. We waited until the hostage was clear and then we went in, but he was standing there, with his weapon cocked, loaded and his finger on the trigger. We unloaded on the boner bomber before he could bust at us. Finally the the terror of the anal assassin was over.",WorldOfPickles

[WP] All of Earth's water disappears. Write what happens in the following days.,MattDude95,"Two had fallen on the ascent, but six made it up the frozen craggy slopes to the plateau.  The sun rose low in the east over the icy landscape.  There was no stopping to rest.  They would need every minute left in the air tanks on their backs.  Two more racks of tanks were pulled behind on sleds.  The third rack of tanks had fallen with the other two climbers.  A quick check of the compass, and the group began their march east.  
  
Mid-morning they passed a hulking hill of snow-covered metal.  A quick search of the wreckage found nothing useful, so they pressed on.  
  
At noon they finally reached their destination.  One of them knocked the ice from the large sign before them.  The large type face said ""WARNING: RESTRICTED AREA.""  A gloved fist knocked against it revealed that their headings were correct: they had reached Long Beach Naval Station at last.  They filed past the sign and set upon cutting a hole the chainlink fence, mindful to make sure the razor wire didn't cut open their protective suits.

[WP] In the far future humanity has long passed its pinnacle. A village has been living very peacefully then one day they find a crashed satellite to which they do not know what it is.,Meetmybody,"I was five years old when the satellite hit. There was a huge crowd. People found the device inside and were unsure as to what it did, so they sealed it off. It turns out that seal wasn't very strong, as my 5-year-old self could get in quite easily. I just had to know what the device was. I looked at the device, perplexed. I had never seen such a contraption. It was a metallic  L-shape, almost like a gun, which I had seen before. Right at what I assumed was the handle, there were 3 arrows pointing to each other in a circle. We were pretty secluded, so I had never seen this symbol before. Then I heard a loud knocking at the door and a voice saying that anyone inside would need to leave. In a panic, I left the way I entered. I needed to bring the device home and wait until I could figure out what it did.

I never did, until today.

I am 27 now, and I decided I was old enough to venture into the ruins of the old society. While walking I came across a set of houses, and around the back I found a plastic box. I kept walking to find many boxes. One of them, however, caught my attention. On the side of the box was a symbol. Memories flashed through my brain as I remembered the symbol on the device. I ran back home.

My hand twitched as I held the device toward my broken childhood playhouse. The symbol glowed, and I touched it. What followed was a huge burst of light and sound. I had to cover my face as dust assaulted my respiratory system.

After the dust cleared I found a cube of oak wood and a cube of plastic where the playhouse should have been. I couldn't believe it. I went to a broken down metal shack, and used the device again. The dust settled, and I found myself face-to-face with a large metal cube.

I knew what I had to do. I ran back from the village outskirts to tell everyone what I had discovered. We could save the world.

"[WP] Due to an unknown mutation, you age 1 year every 100. What's your life like?",OtherAnon_,"He sat, looking both bored and mildly interested at once, fixated on the coffee in front of him and the clock on the wall in his peripheral vision. His black hair a mess, he scratched an itch on his scalp. He took a sip, and leaned back in the chair. “So,” he said, his teenage voice breaking the ice, “You wanted to see me?”

His newfound friend—he hoped—put down several photographs and several other pieces of evidence. “Don’t bother trying to deny it,” he said to the teenager. “Your handwriting stays the same even if you change all your records.”

The teenager rolled his eyes. He leaned forward and put both palms on the table. “You’re obviously not going to get any money if you out me,” he warned. “That’s been done several times and it never works well.”

The thirty-something investigative reporter shook his head with a mild grin. “I’m not interested in ‘outing’ you,” he replied. “I’m only interested in telling your story.”

A quiet laugh escaped the boy as a smirk appeared. “What makes you think I’m interested? Every time I’ve tried to tell my story, nobody believes me.”

The reporter gambled on the truth. “I’m not interested in money or whether people believe it or not,” he answered. “I’m only trying to tell your story before you’re forgotten. Clearly you don’t want to be forgotten, or you’d have disappeared like you did the last time.”

The boy sighed and let out some tension as he rested his hands behind his head, leaning back. “Yeah, and that was a hundred years ago, and it didn’t get me completely forgotten, did it? Kids kept bugging me.” He shook his head, closing his eyes a moment. “Oh, the time flies. Counting the centuries means I’m, what, seventeen?”

The reporter produced his notebook with clippings of various newspapers all in it, reproduction images, and various pages of math. “Your earliest known accepted origin puts you at one thousand, seven hundred and thirty-six years, so, about physically seventeen years of age.”

The boy laughed. “Wow,” he admitted. “I find it funny how historians and scientists have now resorted to guessing my history behind my back.”

“There’s only one way to fix that,” the reporter gambled. “Tell your story.”

The boy pondered for a long moment. “Let me give you a taste, and you can tell me if you’re still in a believing mood,” he replied.

As the reporter started an audio recorder, the boy set a scene. Some four hundred years prior, magical beasts had roamed the once wide-open countryside. He spoke of battles. Great men wielding the power of monsters beyond the imagination of kings. Impossible things whose origin could not be verified. The reporter listened with a skeptical ear, but also, the captivated gaze of a child in a grown body. “Incredible,” he thought out loud.

“That’s nothing,” the boy replied. “I remember each battle. Used to be that every day was open combat. Entire fields would light up with dragons spouting fire and electricity sparking off of flesh. Where steel and rock collided. Insects the size of dogs.”

The reporter shook his head. “I mean, there hasn’t been any evidence of what you’re saying yet, but…”

The boy interrupted him. “Are you interested or not? You've got me talking, and I'm not in an open mood often.”

The reporter nodded furiously. “Yes! Absolutely! I have to know more!”

The boy finished his coffee and stood up. A questioning look on his face. Was the world ready? His thoughts turned to the very ""convenient"" state of the modern world. “Well, if you come back next week, you might even learn the reason why nobody’s dug their bones up.” The boy draped his jacket around his shoulders and his cap on his head. “See you next week, Mr. Robertson.”

The reporter stood and waved. “Absolutely! See you next week, Mr. Ketchum!”

"[WP] Every five years your island society must retreat into bunkers to avoid the month long flood. Out of boredom and rebellion, you surface to find no floodwaters at all. Just the face-less creatures.",Patsfan618,"Makai eyed the large steel door before him. It was the first of five in a corridor that ascended to the surface that the city was built upon. It was flooding up there. Water washing away whatever was worthless enough to be left out when the storm started to come. Just like it was every five years.
 

The adults were always wise enough to bring along enough entertainment to last out the month long event. They could even trade books and stories if one miscalculated how long it would take to read a particular tome. The teens and kids like Makai were harder to entertain. One could only sit around reading or talking so long before it grew tiresome. Electronic entertainment was few and far between, power had to be conserved for the generators to last long enough.
 

That's how the door game came about. It was a simple enough if risky method of play. Over the course of a few days a small group would take turns attempting to sneak past the guards that protected the hallway to the door. Whoever got the furthest without being caught was the winner. If you could touch the first door you were treated as a hero. If you could make it to all the doors you were considered a legend. No one ever made it to the doors.
 

Makai had gotten lucky. He caught the guards during a shift change or a break
 He didn't know which. In the end both left the passage wide open for him to sneak through, and now he stood just a few yards away from the door. He ran up to it and slapped his hands into the handle of the doors lock. It felt heavy when he pushed on it. It wasn’t the type of structure designed to be opened on accident.
 

He turned around and looked back down the hallway. No one in sight as far as he could see. He gripped the handle in both hands and turned it, slowly pulling back the thick steel bars that held the door closed. It took a good minute of turning before he could push the door open and slip out to the other side and just as long to close it and lock it again. All of the doors could be locked from inside or outside except for the outermost door.
 

The next door was at the end of another long corridor, wide and spacious enough to fit large crowds of people. Makai had never noticed how things echoed when it was full of people. The sound of his footsteps bounced off of the walls and rang out around him. It was easy enough to open the second door. The third lay beyond it and up and incline. The fourth door was at the top of a long ladder. It usually made progress slow when everyone was first going down into the bunker. If they didn’t start at least a week before the storm arrived then it would be impossible to get everyone in the city down there in time.
 

Once he crossed through the fourth door Makai looked up. The fifth and final door was in a room that was at the top of another tall ladder. It was usually where the mayor was waiting when evacuations started. Makai climbed up the ladder and into the room. The door here had a plexiglass window built into it. It was tradition for someone to go up and look out at the island through the window each time the flooding had receded. He would probably the first person in a long while who looked through the window while things were still under water.
 
Only that’s not what he saw. Makai looked out the window and things looked normal. There was a storm and there was plenty of water but it barely looked to be anything higher than his ankles, and nothing looked as damaged as it did whenever they would emerge from the bunker. Maybe it was just because it was still early in the month.
 

Makai opened the door and stepped outside into the rain. It felt refreshing to breathe the open air again rather than what was pumped into the bunker. He pulled up the hood of his jacket and walked down the path that led into the city. No matter where he looked or what he walked past things seemed okay. No excess water washing away cars or wearing down building foundations. No giant walls of water threatened to topple entire buildings. At worst it was just cold and wet.
 

There was a sound that broke through the steady drum of rain. Something like metal clanging to the ground. It was probably a trash can someone left out but what could be disturbing it? Most animals ran and hid when the storm started approaching. It was one of the early warnings the city used to prepare.
 

He walked in the direction the sound originated from, keeping to the darker parts of alleys and buildings to remain out of sight. It took some searching but he finally got of the animal causing the noise. Or rather the creature. At first glance it looked almost humanoid but there were key differences. The creature was stark naked and Makai could see its skin was impossibly pale. Even the most closeted of hermits on the island still sported a deep copper tone to their flesh. This thing had pure alabaster skin with odd red veins dancing across it. If that wasn't odd enough its forearms were much longer than a human’s. It could place them on the ground and easily walk about like an ape. And then there was the oddest feature on the creature. Where anything else would normally have a face it had none. The front of its head was smooth and featureless. No eyes. No mouth. Just nothing.
 

Makai watched the creature pick through the contents of a few spilled trash cans. He had no clue what it could be looking for and he sort of didn’t want to know. He began to move away when a second create emerged from between two of the buildings the first beast was rummaging in front of. It climbed along the brick walls high above the ground. It looked like the creature’s digits were digging into the brick to keep hold of it. They must have insane strength.
 

Something was attached to the creature’s “face” and swinging as it moved. It must have been a small dog or something. Makai couldn’t get a good look until the creature dropped it to the ground below and he saw just what it used to carry the poor thing. A vertical divide traveled down the creature’s head, opening to a black maw filled with rows of jagged teeth. The boy was so shocked he fell back into the soaked ground and let out a yelp.
 

Apparently the creatures tracked through sound. Makai’s yelping caused the two to snap their heads in his direction. He swore and pulled himself to his feet. He barely caught a glimpse of the two charging in his direction before he began to sprint back the way he came. The sounds of hands and feet slapping against wet pavement seemed to multiply behind him. The idea of more monsters chasing him caused him to run faster.
 

He heard one of the monsters roar behind him as he got out of the city. The sounds of the creatures behind him seemed to die down as he neared the location of the bunker. He reached the outer door and pulled it open. It would have been hard to imagine his body moving so fast to get inside and seal the door in any other situation. Makai collapsed to the ground panting as soon as he was sure the door was sealed tight. He watched the window for any signs of the creatures as he caught his breath.
 

He jumped when the silence was broken by the sound of someone clearing their throat. He twisted his torso to look behind him. There stood a tall woman, dressed in business attire and glasses. He relaxed some when he saw her copper toned skin and dark hair, and of course her face. It was the mayor of the city. He was just happy it wasn’t one of those things.
 

“M-monsters! There are monsters out there!” Makai turned around and crawled towards the woman in a panic.
 

“What are you doing here?” Her voice was stern. He expected her to be more concerned or angry but that wasn’t the vibe he was getting.
 

“I-I went outside into the city… There were things out there!” He tried to explain. His hands made exaggerated motions as he spoke and tried to articulate what he saw.
 

“You saw the ghouls and came back here?” She didn’t sound surprised. She just knelt down in front of him and put a hand on his shoulder. “Calm down. Did you see them?”
 

Makai froze and met her eye. Ghouls? He would have never imagined that they were already named. He nodded his head and the mayor responded with a sigh.
 

“I was afraid of that,” She said. Makai felt something sharp press against his chest through his jacket and then pierce through cloth and skin. He let out a sharp gasp and looked down. The mayor had pushed a knife into his chest, right where his left long was. “I’m really sorry about this, kid.”
 

Makai tried to talk. He tried to breathe. Both were hard with blood filling his lung. He fell nearly limp to the ground when the mayor pulled away from him. He felt he grab him by the legs and drag him back out the door. She dragged him far enough away from the bunker that no one looking out of the door would be able to see. He watched the mayor yank her knife free of his chest and wipe the blood on it off on his jacket.
 

She didn’t say anything as she turned and walked back into the bunker. He could just barely make out her form stepping into the door and probably locking it from inside. She’d be down to the inner most door by the time the creatures found his body. He could barely see and he couldn’t move, but he felt them swarming around him.

Although we do have an auto-immune disease that we're planning to roll out in the next couple of years that should do it.""

The general spoke up.  ""Viet Nam did quite a bit.  Got rid of a lot of expendables.  Almost got that second civil war going with the States, too.""

""We have the unrest that we're sowing in our part of the world,"" a Middle Eastern accent said.  ""I think if we used religion, we could start new and various crusades and jihads that will solve the problem of humanity destroying the earth.""

The philosopher said, ""Yes, but I've been thinking.  We need something that will not just start pockets of devastation.  We need something that will cause widespread confusion and division.  I've been thinking.  I think I have the solution.""

""What could you have possibly come up with that would do the job that this council has tried to do for centuries?""  The general stood up.  *""Centuries?""*

""No.  The people I have in mind are a lawyer and a flight attendant.""

There was an air of discontent.  ""How?""  The scientist couldn't keep the disbelief out of her voice.  ""How can a lawyer and a flight attendant cause the downfall of humanity?""

""It's a long con,"" the philosopher said.  ""It's not something that would be immediate.  I believe that's where we've been tripping up, looking for something that would have effects in the next three to five years.  What I'm thinking is going to take some forty to fifty years to really see the results.""

""And you think these two can cause that?""

""I've had my eye on them.  The lawyer is self-centered and egotistical.  The flight attendant, even moreso.  I think if we could get these two together, and they have children, then those children will be even *more* self-centered and egotistical.  And I think those traits will manifest themselves with a desire for fame, a desire that will have them doing more and more outlandish stunts to get in the public eye.  After much thinking, and exploring various scenarios, I think that this family, this fame-centered dynasty, will cause a rift so severe in the public, between those that love them and those that despise them, that humanity will surely tear itself apart.""

Either way, religiously conservative parents always thought their kid was going to hell. Straight A's and first chair clarinet wouldn't change that. Their solution wasn't encouragement on my good changes, it was a bible, a person they thought followed the ways of god, and bible camp. It all worked out perfectly. They dumped me on him when he said he could take me with his kids when he went. He didn't really have kids though. 


&gt; Your a good kid by any standards. You should probably know that. Keep that in your head because where I send you, your life is going to be shit. 


For four hours I was a crying rag doll. To him I was an it. He threw it into the trunk, gagged and tightly bound, covered by a blanket. He drove it to some location out in the desert. He drug it out and threw it on the ground, severely dehydrated with a poor make up job running down my face. He was right and I was prepared for it to get worse. There was another man there, Mexican with a couple other guys. 


At least it was cool outside. I had started to become numb, shock was setting in, but I had just started accepting everything. I was a 17 year old girl, pretty but not the prettiest. I was tied up still in my uniform I wore to my catholic school, gagged, coerced, and treated like a lump of meat. They were even bartering over me. 

&gt;5000, that's the lowest I go. 

They made the deal. I was worth $5000. That's all I was now, an item worth $5000.

They put their purchase in the trunk, drove off into the distance. It was about 10 minutes until they stopped. I started crying. I told myself I would fight them, but doubts kept coming into my head. These guys were ready to buy humans, they probably wouldn't be afraid to kill one. 

The trump popped open. 

&gt;We're sorry miss, we had to make sure he didn't see us. Let us cut you free. 

For maybe the second time that night I was in shock. They cut my bonds, telling me to get up slowly. I was sore. I fell out of the car when my legs gave way. All I could do was cry and thank them. 

&gt;We are a part of the FBI. That guy back there has been pulling that gambit all over the southwest united states. We wish you didn't have to go through that, but he is currently detained. We got him soon after we left. 

The Desert night is cold, no matter what time of the year. Shivering in silence, they hugged me and kept on telling me it was going to be ok. When I finally got up and they drove me home, I looked up at the stars. The hundreds of little dots in the sky were more intense then I had ever seen them. I had never felt more free than in that moment. It was like I had not breathed in hours and suddenly, that cold night air tasted like nectar. ",Laffmeister
"[WP] ""Do you remember what the Pied Piper did to the rats when he was finished? The same thing I will do to you.""",Traincakes,"I think I should’ve been afraid of him. There I was, tied up in a dark room, with a man who was most certainly completely insane. His eyes were large and manic. His grin was so wide it threatened to split his face. The dim lighting didn’t help; it only served to contort his features even further. I should’ve been terrified… but I wasn’t. More than anything, I was confused.

“Sorry, sorry, sorry. Could you explain that again?” I asked, utterly perplexed.

“I’m going to do to you, what Pied Piper did to those rats,” he responded. His grin seemed to be getting more forced as time went on.

“No, see, you’re just rephrasing it. I’m asking, what does that even mean? What did that guy do to those rats?” I have to admit; I was getting a bit frustrated by his indirectness.

I think his eye twitched.

“Hehehe. Have you never heard the story of the Pied Piper? He used his magic flute to lure all the rats in Hamelin to a river… and then he drowned them!” He giggled like a madman. Appropriate, I suppose.

“Oh, alright. So, you’re going to drown me in a river… using a magic flute. Do I have that right? Where’d you get a magic flute?” At that point, I was intrigued. It’d be worth drowning if I could experience real magic!

“Ha. Ha. Ha. No! There’s no magic flute!” He yelled, trying desperately to fight off a frown.

Damn.

“Ok, ok. So, you’re going to drown me in a river?” I asked.

“Yes.”

“Ok, ok. But, I can swim, you know, so how will you…” I trailed off, still not one hundred percent sure what the plan was here.

His eye was definitely twitching.

“Obviously, I would keep you submerged!” He shouted, looking much saner now without the maniacal grin.

“Yeah, but how!?” I growled in frustration. Not only was this guy crazy, he was also an utter moron.

Before we could go any further, the police burst in. Apparently, someone had seen me get abducted, and was able to provide enough information to lead the authorities straight here. As I watched the officers drag the maniac away, I felt an unease that I couldn’t shake off.

“Are you alright, boy? What was he gonna do to you?” an officer asked while he removed the ropes from me.

I stared at the space my kidnapper once occupied.

“Drown me in a river?” I replied, not quite recovered from the experience.

The officer looked confused for a second, before he asked, “Oh. But you can swim right? So how would that…?”

…

I still don’t know.

Just in time too, as he had been the only one at work who hadn't seen the new blockbuster. ""Where do you want us to install it"" the deliveryman asked. ""Follow me, its just in here"" Charles said only just containing his glee. Charles showed the man to the living room where the the old telescreen was. ""alright, you still want us to take the old screen right?"" asked the delivery man. ""Please, I'll give you a hand getting into the truck. it's a shame these things aren't smaller though, would be nice to be able to keep multiple movies"" Charles said with a sad tone. He enjoyed the last movie and knew that eventually he would want to watch it again, but as the film for each was so large and had to be built into the telescreens it meant that he he only had room for one at a time. It was an inconvenience but unfortunately they hadn't figured out a way to condense the physical size of the film so each had to be ordered in specially. 

They returned from the truck and had connected the new telescreen to the power and set it up in-front of the couch. The new model was slightly smaller, maybe only by an inch or so, but progress nonetheless. It also had a few extra knobs and dials, Charles wasn't really interested in learning about these so immediately sat down to enjoy the new movie, glad he'd finally be caught up and would no longer be the only one who hadn't seen it.

**[Excerpt from the journals of Laurence Whitworth, inventor of ethereal rocketry]**

The Negro, and more specifically the NeoLithic tribes found in Boer country, have an amazing affinity for excursions into the vacuous altitudes above the highest strata of clouds. Perhaps it is genetic, perhaps it is a result of their acclimation to a hostile wilderness of their own in the Afric hinterland; regardless of the reason, though, these ""brier apes"" have returned in excellt [sic] condition in all of the excursions they have been sent on, though their data collection faculties leave much to be desired.

I suppose it is a cruel irony, that civilised schols [sic] who would best be able to understand the mysteries of the great Beyond are trapped here on the ground, while our savage and superstitious brethren may tarry there with little to no harmful effects. Still, though, it will not do to complain of nature, and by this time next year I hope to have completed an apparatus to counteract the ill effects of Ether on Her Majesty's scholars.

It’s definitely going to be a thing!

Donald's last word was clipped off by David, shouting. David, standing now, his arms extended and bracing against Donald's desk was breathing heavily and the audible in of air and expelling of carbon dioxide was the only sound piercing the momentary silence.

Don't get so worked up David.

David remained standing.

Donald, you pay me to handle the public relationship of NASA with the population of America. I have spent seven years of my life and one marriage getting us to where we are now. Our funding is five times what it was at the start of the twenty tens. That's not because the government started deciding that they love spending money, christ we're in a Republican dynasty here, it's because I've got the American people to believe in us, to believe in space and space travel. We're second only to Star Wars in our favorability rankings. You have to let me get ahead of this, you have to let me do my job, you can't just announce this as a side note in a briefing.

It's a science paper David, just a scientific brief.

Whose core finding is that bone density resistance to weightlessness is significantly higher in those descendants from the sub saharan regions of the world!

People from different parts of the world have minor differences in their physical attributes. This isn't news to anyone.

His hand moved to his face and rubbed his eyes lightly as David tried to comprehend how some one so intelligent, someone who engineered combustion chambers in rockets could be so stupid.

Black people are better astronauts.

Excuse me?

That's the headline Donald, that's the headline, Black people are better astronauts.

Oh come now, the brief is talking bone densities, not how capable an individual is.

His hand fell away from his face and flung to the office's lone window as the shouting resurfaced.

It's not about what the brief says Donald! It's about what they say out there in the real world! And I know what they'll say, that's my thing! You are over here with rockets and I'm over here with the press. The headline will read black people are better astronauts!

There was a brief silence, but it was naught but an interlude in the opera that was David's fury.

And that headline is a disaster for NASA Donald, a fucking disaster. Forty-eight percent of the country is white Donald, forty-eight percent. We're going to lose half of that populations support, that's nearly a quarter of the country, and without that quarter of the country we backslide into millennium level numbers where we can barely scrap enough together to get an unmanned vehicle to Mars.

Donald tried to get in a quip about a quarter of the country not dropping their support for NASA funding due to a single report about bone density, but he didn't make it very far into his well thought out statement before he was shouted down again.

Because they're racist Donald! They don't even know that they are, but they are. These are the people that walk down the street and think to themselves, hah, I didn't cross the street when that black guy was walking towards me, look how civilized and evolved I am. Those are the people who when the headline of black people are better astronauts hits are going to slowly shift their support away from us. They'll rationalize it with other reasons but with God as my witness it will happen because they're racist.

Nearly a minute after that a voice finally piqued up.

Well what would you have me do David?

Bury the report.

David, people spent nearly a year on this study and we pumped a quarter of a million dollars.

Use it internally, people here are mostly rational, don't release it. If it leaks eventually I can handle that, but I need the time Donald, I need the time to prep for this. I can't deflect this if we publish tomorrow, we'll lose control of the dialog.

I'll consider it David.

I'm not telling you to consider it Donald, I'm telling you to do it.

At that Donald, a man who thought very highly of his control over his emotions, stood up.

Who do you think you are to tell me what to do.

I'm just someone who loves NASA, I love what we do, I love what we stand for. I don't want to lose that. You can fire me and get someone else if this conversation ended our relationship, that's fine, but I'm telling you, there are things I would sacrifice all that I've accomplished here for, but not this, not bone density.

David, being exceptional at communicating with people, sat down. Donald sat as well.

Alright David, alright.

Thank you, sir.

David was almost to the door out of the office before Donald got in one last word.

[WP]Write the most cliched story possible,bigboxman8,"Woken up by a snarl coming from outside of my bedroom window, I glanced at the conveniently placed mirror on the ceiling above my bed.  I looked at my long, curly blonde hair and perfectly even skin tone in disgust. *God, why am I so ugly?*

The image in the mirror rippled, like water disturbed by a stone. I lifted myself up by my arms, trying to get a better look at what was going on. The rippling stopped, and a strange old man appeared. His bushy white brows pulled together, wrinkling his old skin even more. “Hello,” he said, dragging out the word. It sounded more like a question than a greeting. 

“Hello,” I answered.

“Hello,” the old man repeated, squinting and leaning closer. 

“I can hear you,” I said, standing and looking straight up almost touching the mirror. This time I dragged the word, speaking louder in the hopes that he’d hear me, “Hello.” 

 “Rufus,” he said and looked behind him, his hand pointing toward the mirror. “Did you use this to call that girlfriend of yours again?” He paused, waiting for an answer. “Don’t you lie to me!”

“I’m not lying,” a boy’s voice responded, sounding as if he had been trapped in a glass. A few seconds later the boy appeared, looking over the old man’s shoulder, his upper lip lifted in confusion. 

“Hello,” he said.

I sighed, replying again. School was starting soon, and I wanted to arrive just in time so that I didn’t have to stand in front of my locker alone, again. Whoever this was that was trying to make contact had to hurry up. Even though this was the most exciting thing to happen to me in my miserable life, I wasn’t much interested in it. 

“You forgot to flip the switch,” the boy said. As he reached over the old man’s shoulder, I heard something click. “Can you hear us now?” he asked, looking at me.

“I’ve heard you all along.” I rolled my eyes. For someone invading my privacy, I'd expect them to be a little more prepared. 

 The old man pushed the boy’s head off his shoulder by lifting it slightly. “Niendralia Longthorn, you are the last remaining witch of the Ancient Wicoma Coven. The world is in danger and only you can save it. Tomorrow morning, a knight will come for you. The two of you must find the elder rock, and bring it to me.”

The mirror reverted back to normal. I frowned, confused. Little old me couldn’t be the savior! No way!

The yelp of a dog sounded outside, desperate and wild. I hoped it wasn’t my Leonardo Francious Thomason the third. I had been in love with him since the fourth grade, but he had yet to pass me a single glance. Jumping up, I raced to the window, peeking out to see what was going on. 

A vampire had wandered into their territory, again. Our house was just outside of it. I watched them daily, hoping the dear Leonardo would show himself.

The vampire was cornered by ten wolves. His shirt was torn, revealing his tight abs. I swooned. He had been like no other that I’ve seen before. The sun was at its peak and his skin did not burn. He was exotic in his beauty. Too bad he’d be torn to shreds soon. *No!* I was going to save him.

Leonardo stepped out from behind a row of trees, his eyes met mine. My heart fluttered, and dropped in fear. Werewolves and vampires lived in secret. Now that she saw me, I dreaded to think what he’d do. We went to the same school, surely he wouldn’t harm me. I wouldn’t tell a soul!

The vampire ran at the wolves. Gaining speed, he looked more like a gust of wind than a man. The werewolves cried, one by one dropping to the ground. 
Leonardo was the only one that remained, still in his human form. They faced each other, backs arched and hands pressed into tight fists. 

“No!” I shouted. “Stop!”

The Vampire turned to me. Waves of heat and chill took turns running up and down my spine. I had seen him before. For the life of me, I couldn’t remember where. His stone like expression softened and his fists relaxed. A feeling of devotion stirred within me. Instantly, I knew. And by the spark that formed in the deep depth of his mysterious eyes, it looked like he did too. We were soulmates.

""*zieg-kathathonca'nyahlotha!*"", they trembled and shook with the might of the thousand maws.

Fear was him, oblivion had been his domain. Now the world of the perilous, the mortal pain and hopelessness, was truly his to conquer. The subjects were ready for the slithering probe, painful and unspeakable horrors ready to infest the most naive of mind, yet also the strongest. C'thulu, the *Great one*, rose above the the waves, collapsing fragile tectonic plates in his wake. He shook and the clouds whimpered. He gasped inferno, and the sun fell pale in comparison. Wretched tentacles reached around the world, preparing the end.

""Yo', 'Em!"", Nick shouted across aisle seven.

""What's up, dicknugget!?"", 'Em shrieked back.

C'thulu, the *Great One*, saw through the eyes within his thousand arms. Because he, the drowned God with a heart of black ice, was all-seeing and only he and the staring goat with seven eyes would, could and stood omnipotent. 

""Where' da vape shit at, yo!"", Nick vocalised with grace.

""What the fuck."", C'thulu, the *Great one*, exclaimed from the walls.

""Don't swear, Nicholas!"", 'Em came running with a sense of irritant laziness.

""I only gone' said, shit!"", Nick defended himself.

""*Yogg'sarothan! Yogg'sottohiana! Zothath-knapikanta nyalotha'kathatha!"", C'thulu, the *Great One*, enchanted the foolish mortals.

""What the fuck is that sound, doe'?"", Nick continued.

""I said no swearing!"", 'Em answered faintly present.

Instead she looked around. Towards the walls.

""Ya' hear it, too?"", Nick pressed on.

He was a shaggy figure. Tall and slender, which in their own were far to splendid word for Nicholas. Slender could be fragile and we, and tall could just be his absence of any frame nor genetical gift, whatsoever. 'Em had a lazy eye, and always kept on biting her nails. Nervous figures, both of them. The latter, perhaps brighter. C'thulu, the *Great one*, knew these kind of mortals. Easy to shape, mindless organisms of futile effort and lifespans. Manipulation was his breath and control was his flesh.

""*Yogg'sarothan! Yogg'sottohiana! Zothath-knapikanta nyalotha'kathatha!*"", the Old God repeated himself through milk cartons and expired cheese.

""Shut up, rats!"", Nick threw an old receipt, which only made itself a staggering two feet before succumbing to gravity and physics.

""Fucking listen!"", C'thulu, the *Great one*, snapped and lost his cool

""Yo, what, is that you Jonathan!?"", Nick brightened up. ""Up for some fine hoe, like dat' Ta'rishia bitch from 9-11, back in 09'? Heard she was back in town, *big booty bitch*!"", Nick laughed out loud and his hillbilly accent shone through like the ass crack of a newly divorced single father.

""Fuck this, for real.."", C'thulu, the *Great one*, sighed.

With disappointment and disbelief, the fiend of a thousand maws descended yet again back into the abyss of blackness and living oil. On the way down he met his brother, *Yogg-Sottoh*. While they did not like each other, C'thulu, yet again the *Great one*, knew that too was all-seeing.

""You saw that shit, man?"", C'thulu, the *Great one*, threw out.

""Yeah, bro. Fuck that, that dude looked like fucking Scooby-Doo!"", Yogg-Sottoth, *the one who slumbers in the deep dark below*, whimpered. 

""That's *Shaggy*, retard"", C'thulu, the *Great one*, rolled his eyes.

""You know what?"", Yogg-Sottoh, *the one who slumbers in the deep dark below*, shouted out load in a cascade of rotten bubbles.

""What, bro?"", the other answered.

""Just wait..""

Three weeks later world hunger was perished. And while C'thulu, and his brother Yogg-Sottoth, found this only lightly successful, they were also happy that chaos once again ruled. For that was what they lived off. The frightening, the hideous, the true kind of the *Voidlord*, had descended from their homeworld of Nyalotha. Under the sun he levitated, meditating and thinking of his next offering. In the end, the second become the same as the first, and the formost become identical to the very last. It was the *Spaghetti-Monster*!. Tremble, mortals. See and obey your true king. For only he can provide true carbonara and sweet Italian food.

'They live at the other side of the country. It's a 6 hour flight. They barely visit me because they are too busy with their own children and their careers. I don't blame them, but I think it would take away a burden on them if they didn't have to visit me every once in a while.'

'I've lost my parents when I was little. I still miss them every day. Don't make your children miss you for longer than they have to.'

The older man contemplated what the younger man said.

'I won't if you won't.'

'It's a deal. If you're really that lonely, I could visit you once in a while.'

'I'd love that. I'll give you some tips for the ladies.'

'Oh old man, I don't think you know how dating works nowadays.'

'Trust me, some old tricks still work, otherwise I wouldn't have 4 beautiful grandchildren.'

The younger man laughed. The older man laughed. The younger man grabbed the  gun. 

'Don't worry old man.'

The younger man aimed at the rope and shot it loose from the tree.

'It's official now. What's your name?'

They walked back to the city. They talked. They laughed. Fifteen years later, the younger man visited the funeral of the older man, together with his wife and children. He worked for the older man's son, who transferred to this city fourteen years and six months ago. They mourned together. Nobody knew about how the younger man and older man met each other, but they know everything got better from the day they met.

"[WP] Two men went to the woods to commit suicide, they met and tried convince the other to not go through with it but at the same time trying to justify his own choice.",dougiedeez,"Tom went out of his cabin for the final time. Shotgun in hand, he made his way deep into the forest, the only place he felt at home. 

Max ran away from home for the final time. Rope in hand, he made his way deep into the woodlands, the only place he felt he could do this. 

Tom set it all up. He had the shotgun to his head. All he had to do…

*Crunch.*

Max’s shocked face looked up at Tom, who was in the midst of shaking with sobs. 

“Don’t!” Max pleaded impulsively. This man was much taller and more muscular than him. He had a big, bushy, beard that was well groomed. His black hair was cut neatly, and he was in his underwear. Max could see the muscle on this behemoth of a man even from where he was. Tom kept the gun where it was, but relaxed his hand from the trigger. 

“Why not?” He managed to get out between sobs. Tom looked at the younger boy, and the best descriptor he could think of was frail. This boy was white as a ghost and skinny as a skeleton. He had earnest blue eyes that looked like he was about to break at any given moment. Every breath he took expanded his chest visibly, because of how tiny he was. His baggy clothes were obviously a few sizes too big, and were definitely not helping how small he looked. 

“Someone out there cares about you,” Max reasoned, “I know it. There’s someone out there who really cares, and depends on you, and you’re going to take the best part of their day away if you do this.” The man lowered the gun slightly, his muscles responding under his dark skin. The sunlight bounced off of him, illuminating him like some sort of angel. 

“No. I have no one. You don’t know me. You can’t make that accusation.” Tom gruffly spat. He felt his arm scream against the weight of the gun and gravity. He readjusted himself, once again looking at the pleading boy. He took a deep breath, and gave in to his arm. The gun dropped like dead weight. 

Max thought for a moment. “You have me.”

“What does that even mean?! You’re a stranger! How can you care about me?” Tom protested.

“Because,” Max explained, sorting his thoughts, “you need me to.”

Tom wavered. He felt a rush of emotion, and for a quick second, even reconsidered. He shook his head after a long pause. “You’re just saying that. You’re just saying that because you found me here. If you knew me, you wouldn’t give a shit, just like everyone else.”

“I would give a shit. I would.” Max paused, once again trying to think. He gripped the rope at his side slightly tighter, and Tom’s eyes flickered to it. “That’s not right. I don’t know how I’d feel, but I care now. You’d be letting down one person. So there.”

“Kid, you don’t know what it’s like being me. You don’t. My family is dead. I don’t have friends. And I can’t stand it anymore. I cannot live on this earth one more minute.” Tom stated matter-of-factly, his mind wandering about the rope his young companion held. He wiped his face of the tears that once streamed down it, and really looked at this kid. His eyes held something Tom recognized- anguish. 

“You’re right. I have parents, I have friends. I don’t know what it’s like to be you, but I know- I know what feeling alone is like. I know how that is.” Max admitted, looking around instead of straight at the man. Tom looked at him a little closer, to how he held that rope, which looked to be tied in a certain, familiar way. Suddenly, he realized.

“No. You can’t say that shit to me and try to reason with me to live when you’re doing the same thing. No. You’re a kid. You can’t-” Tom’s voice got caught in his throat.

Max simply looked at the rope, and shrugged. “You have more to live for.”

“You’re a child, you can’t just let go… And you have friends and a family, all of them are going to be devastated if they lose you!” Tom fought, something sparking inside him. A protectiveness for this frail boy who’d he shared one of his last moments with. 

“I know. But I’ve accepted that. Because I can’t tell them about… anything about me. So I’ve accepted that this is the trade-off. I stop suffering, they stop suffering. And yeah, it’s selfish. But that’s me.” Max managed a light chuckle instead of tears. 

“I’m sure they’ll accept you, no matter what. That’s what love does, it lets people see the best. And they all love you, and I’m sure they still-”

“Yeah, they’ll still love their suicidal, anorexic, gay, son. I’m sure they’ll see the best in the fact that I don’t like girls. Also in the fact that I don’t eat. I don’t eat and I’m still huge.” Now, the tears took over. Max sobbed openly. 

“I still like you, even after all of that.” Tom tested, only speaking the truth. 

“You don’t know me!” Max screeched, like a baby bird pleading for help.

“But you need me to care. So I am. Even though I don’t know you, I’m returning the kindness.” Tom explained, levelheaded, calm. The sunshine melted on his skin, warming him, engulfing him in its message. 

Max looked at Tom with his puppy-dog eyes, pleading for something. Something glinted in his eye, and he was reminded of the gun in Tom’s hand. “Don’t do it, please.” Max begged, in almost a whisper.

Tom was reminded of his original task, and an odd acceptance laid itself over him. The trees swayed around them, and Tom felt the breeze in his hair. “I have to. I’m sorry. I really have nothing. You have a reason. To stay. I don’t. I can’t- I don’t want to anymore. I’m nothing to anyone, and I’m sorry I can’t help you more. I’m sorry that I’m useless. I’m sorry- and thank you for letting me share my final moments with you, here.” Tom raised the gun, once again. He knew it was abrupt, he knew he was destroying his new acquaintance, but he just had an overlay of apathy about it all. He made an easy cleanup for the paramedics, he left a note at his house with the clothes he wanted to be buried in, and he wasn’t about to get this kind of courage ever again. He knew it, and he couldn’t take it, not going through with his plan. He took his final breath of fresh air, and pulled the trigger. 

The bang forced Max to close his eyes, right before he lunged towards Tom. But he heard it, and it rung in his ears. His body smacked to the ground, missing the bigger man, and he kept his eyes closed, his back to the body. Max sobbed, once again. He felt the wet ground being absorbed into his sweater, into his sweatpants. He felt the sun wash over him, he felt the cool touch of the clouds. He laid there for a long time, trying to process what just happened. He couldn’t. After a while, he stood up, and was enraged.

Max took in a shaky breath, and just screamed. The forest echoed his scream, and then swallowed it, accepting his pain with open arms. He screamed again. And again, until his throat was raw. He screamed with the agony of someone who had seen their own parent die. He screamed, and screamed, and screamed until he couldn’t feel the difference between screaming and not. Suddenly, he took a deep breath. The sun shone in his eyes as he looked up to the perfect, blue, sky. He couldn’t. He didn’t want to see anything but this, ever again. Emotionless, he picked up the shotgun. It still had a round in it. 

He looked up to the sky, his blue eyes so similar to it, and pressed the gun underneath his chin. A single tear rolled down his solemn face. 

*Bang.*

“It’s almost like…almost like the day you go for your haircut. 
You’ve been waiting to cut it for a couple weeks, and finally decide something should be done about it. You make a mental note, maybe make a half-ass attempt to make an appointment, and mark it on your calendar because it has to be done. But, honestly, who really gives a fuck, right?” 

“The day finally arrives, and wouldn’t you know it, it’s the best fucking hair day you’ve had all year! It’s just the right length and might as well have been done by Brad fucking Pitt’s personal stylist…but you decide to cut it anyway. I’ll tell you why you always decide to cut it, and that’s because everyone knows this one truth: the minute you decide to keep going with your long greasy hair for one more day, you’ll wake up tomorrow, look into the mirror, and see the same ugly thing on top of your head that you started with yesterday. Nothing will change, except the fact you decided to not cut that mop when you had the chance.

In a nutshell, that’s how you feel on the day you made an appointment to cut your life short.

“I’ve always wondered if high intelligence was correlated with a higher likelihood for depression. I mean if you really think about it (or don’t because you’re not neurotic like I am) life has a more, lets say, logical feel to it. Logic, by nature, is cold and unwavering. That outlook on life doesn’t exactly elicit images of Monet’s “Water Lillies” or a scene from the “Sound of Music.” I would say, to those who have been cursed with a higher IQ, life becomes more like one of those sad, monochromatic, and “modern” art pieces you see in a booshy New York bachelor pad…but one that belongs there because the occupant of that apartment, if he stands as my metaphor for life, has no taste.”

“You see, it’s hard to taste the food in your mouth when someone is forcing it down your throat. Honestly, when does anybody have the time to feel out their own preferences when the society of quintessential American cardboard cut-outs already has it all laid out for you?

“Now, I’d assume people are generally some place between the “If I ever see daylight again it will be too soon” to “Let’s try skydiving without a parachute” on the “I’m chronically depressed and therefore there is nothing to lose” scale.

Two sounds can be heard, one of them. SIGH!  
  
Four eyes, and too-nice.
Both men, both mice.  

One sleek and clean, suit and glasses. 
Other reeks and looks mean, fast-food and gases.
    
""How are you supposed to do it?""
""Point a gun to my head and lead it...   You?"" 
  
""My method is simple, I need a creek and a stone.
On the bottom of a lake I can finally be alone."" 
  
""Why, should that go through?
my world would be paradise for you!
Forever alone, not a single one to see.
Living in a basement, my parents are ashamed of me.
Im a virgin, love I'll never be seeing.
I hate myself, my entire being.""
  
""Let me stop you right there!
The grass is not greener at the other lair.
I'm very popular you see.
So people always want to be with me.
But it's a curse.
I've never been worse. 
The proper life, living on the edge...
is actually about grabbing on to a ledge.
And never ever letting go, which I just did.
I crashed and fell, my failure I tried to hid.
But it was no point, my life is over. 
So in comparison to your absence of a lover.
It's nothing, a cry in space. 
While I've lost my life's pace.""
  
""Now that you say such things, what are you really complaining about?
You be like me, but it makes you stronger, more devout.
Solitude can be the thing that cleanses you...
When you ask for the one you are and the answer is who. 
People are cruel and greedy...
Unthankful and needy.""
  
""I agree, I need to be more lone.
Maybe take a rest, put down the phone.
But you my friend, try to give love a chance.
Much more than you first glance. 
Because the love I made and felt...
Was not based on the color shade of her pelt.""
  
Two men in the woods, among trees sky high.
Manly tears are cried, while dawn is nigh. 
  
A night of hate and fear...
has brought two strangers near.
And left them with sight above vision.
Each one on their own mission. 

Two men walk, filled with insight. 
That one mans dark is another mans light.

He had dropped his partially full bottle several hundred meters back, but gripped the small hand-me-down revolver in his hand with animal-like desperation. He eventually found himself in a small clearing that was home to a large stump, and temporary host to a slim man in an Armani suit. He too held a handgun, though his was in clearly better condition. It looked new. Armani looked up, his face was stony, his eyes razor sharp. 


“Who the hell are you?” The tension rose as each man recognized the others’ firearm. 


“I’m gonna kill myshelf tonight,” slurred Mariners. “Wife left me. You too?”


“Yes. Caught embezzling company funds. You’re a fucking mess aren’t you?”


“Fuck you man, we’re in the same boat here. Killing yourself for work is stupid though.” 
Armani rose with his anger, lashing out, “At least I’m not the pussy about to put a bullet in his head over some dumb bitch!”


“God you’re a heartless bastard aren’t you? Even if I am a mess, at least I’m not someone like you.”


“That’s exactly how I feel about you, asshole.”


The two men, one ragged and sloppy, the other tall and sleek, looked at each other with rage. Mariners had been shocked out of his drunken stupor, and looked with uncontrolled anger at Armani, who was shaking, infuriated. They raised their respective weapons, and they fired. At their own heads. What did you expect?

Jump rope?"" asked the man who looked so tired he looked ten years older. The boy didn't hear him come up behind him dispite the leaves on the ground from last fall.

They both looked up into the tree in front of them. the forest was dence with them but the boy chose this one specifically. A rope tied into a crude noose hung from the second to lowest branch. They watched as if it was a poisonous snake about to strike.

""no jump rope, huh?"" the man said. ""how old are you, kid?""

""fourteen, sir.""

""goddamn, fourteen years....why?""

""I'm sorry?""

""why would you want to do this? What in fourteen years of your life could be so horrible?""

""why would i want to do what, sir?""

""you know what, kid.  Im not stupid. Infact..."" The man walked to a nearby stump and pulled a 9mm handgun from his waistbelt and sat down with it in his lap.
""Infact, i think we're here for the same reason.""

""Different reasons, sir. But the same conclusion.""

The man traced his '5 o'clock from yesterday morning' stubble around his lips.
""shit. your a smart little fucker arent you? Dark. Incredibly dark, but a hard thinker. I think we got alot more in common than this, so I'll ask again. 'why?'""
The boy looked away into the forest. The sun was shining on a beautiful spring day and he could hear the birds enjoying it. futher in the distance in the opposite direction he could here other children enjoying the day just as much.

""Theres no point,"" he said like the beginning of a great thought but did not continue.

""Theres no point? Of course theres a point or we wouldn't be here.""

""no,"" the boy interuptted  ""theres no point in anything. Life is pointless. you live. you die. you have friends, they die. You find love, They die. Out in space, in the cosmos, are a billion stars and around those billion stars are a billion planets just like ours more than likely with a billion people hussling about on their surfaces. theres a billion of you, theres a billion of me and we're all just little specks of dust floating aimlessly until..."" The boy blew into his hands and spread them, not like an explosion but like a candle burning out.

""Jesus, kid."" the man pulled a pack of cigarettes from his pocket and pulled one out with his lips. The man held out the pack towards the kid and he shook his head with a surprise on his face like he was being offered heroin. The man shrugged and started to put in away but then the kid, in a second thought, reached out his hand. The man handed him one and lit their cigarettes with a bic lighter. 

The man's lungs told him to quit with an instant smokers cough. He hocked up a yellow gooey substance in his mouth that he immediately spit on the ground.
""you know, I blame schools."" He said, wiping excess saliva from his lips on his sleeve.

""what?""

""Schools make you kids to smart, to quick. You really shouldn't have an existential crisis until your atleast in your mid twenties, but good for you for getting it out of the way early.""

""A what?""

""an existential crisis. everything you just said. With of hint of Nihilism.""
""you sound like a smart little fucker, yourself"" the boy said.
The man chuckled, ""nah, kid. Just spent alot of time trying to find myself. More well-read than anything."" The man took another drag of his cigarette coughed up a lung again.

""Now,"" The man said after he caught a breath. ""I'm sure thats not the reason your here today. People don't wake up thinking this way. Let me guess, High school outcast, no friends, Girls won't take you to prom. typical high school bullshit.""

""My parents and two best friends died In the same car crash..."" The boy hit the man with a verbal right hook.

""shit....""

""different cars, same crash."" The man was K.O'd

""How the fuck does that happen?!""

""My parents were going away for a week for there anniversary. They said I didn't need a babysitter but they wanted my friends to stay over so I wouldn't be alone. you know that blind spot on the corner of the library?""

""yeah, I hate that place. You can't see shit with that hedge.""

""Yeah well, They didn't see each other. Mom and dad were late for there flight and my best friends parents were late for dropping them off. They were both in a rush. My parents and one friend died at the scene. The other friend died on the way to the hospital. I didn't get to say goodbye to anyone and now I'm left with no one. Everyone died. Everyone dies. Its just a matter of time."" The boy said this all so coldly and unemotionally that it was like he was answering a question about science to a teacher.

""who are you staying with?""

""My grandma, but we don't get along very well. There’s too much of an age gap. She doesn't understand the world nowadays. How scary do you think that is? Just losing all sense of the world around you.”

“I think your being a little dramatic, kid.”

“They didn’t have tvs when she was a girl and now we have computers and Ipods and fucking cars with ipods and computers in them.”

The man smirked at the kids curse. The boy was beginning to relax and that’s just what the man wanted.

“Well, how do you feel about Watson? That new Atifical intelligence thing by Microsoft that’s straight out of 2001: a space odyssey. How do you feel about that new fangled contraption, old man.” The man jokingly said.

“That’s different.“

“You know what I think? Not to be rude, but I think your just looking for excuses to do it,”

“Death in my life isn’t a fucking excuse asshole.” The kid said angerly.

“no, no, not that kid. I’m damn sure that’s the reason you are here today. What I’m trying to say is if you wanted to kill yourself over loss then that would be your reason. Loss. But you are reaching for every reason under the sun. I losted the people closest to me, I’m a little speck of dust in this big thing called life, Im scared to get older. You are weight pros and cons and your reaching for every pro you can get.”

“it hurts” the kid bowed his head to hide his tears, “life. It hurts.”

“I know it does kid. Life is pain, but you have to fight for the good stuff because in the end, the true end, That’s all that matters. The good times you had. You’re parents, your friends. They aren’t gone. Not to sound like a fucking Disney movie but they live inside you. Its true. They wouldn’t want to see you like this would they? They wouldn’t want you to end it. You’ve got to live for them. You’ve got to live for the life they don’t have anymore.”

“fuck…” there was no hiding the kids tears anymore. He knelt in the dead leaves and cupped his hands to his face. The man got up from his stump and knelt with him. Keeping his distance but putting a caring arm around the boy. They stayed there for a good 5 minutes.

“you ok, kid?” the man asked as they both stood up.

“Yeah…yeah I think I’m ok for now.” He said.

“Meet me here again” the man recommended, “Everyday, every week, whatever you feel like you need. We’ll set a date.”

“Fridays? at sunset?”

“Sounds good to me.” The man smiled.

As they walked out of the forest the boy said “you know, You never told me why you were here.”

“Well, I came here to put a bullet in my head. The reason’s unimportant.  I’m not a true beliver in fate or anything but lets just say as soon as I saw you, my reason for being here changed.”

The man felt another cough coming on. He took a handkerchief from his back pocket and coughed into it, leaving another blood stain in the cloth. He planned on giving the kid the rest of his cigarettes whenever they parted. He didn’t need them anymore. He didn’t need them anymore. He wouldn't bother warning him about the dangers of smoking. It would fall on deaf ears like it did when he was a child. He just hoped that the kid wouldnt kill himself with them like he did.

A sleek red sports car slowed as it passed him, screeching to a stop along side the man causing him to pause his journey. ""Where ya headed?"" The driver asked; a heavyset older man dressed in fine clothing but with a worn look in his pale blue eyes.

""Headed down toward the sea of trees"" it was a nickname given to a local forest because like the one in Japan, this one also beckoned to those who had lost there way.

""Well come on then, it seems that our destination is the same. Tom."" ""Jason."" The ride was a silent one as each man contemplated his fortune, the complications of life and what might be there at the end.

They pulled into an old parking area, empty other then a small yellow car so covered in grime that it looked to have been there for years. Tom shut the car off, reaching into the back and grabbing the rifle that he had brought with him. Jason opened the door and got out, adjusting his backpack and heading out into the darkness of the trees.

""Hold up!"" The larger man didn't even bother to lock the doors, wheezing slightly as he hurried to catch up to the other. ""I know why your here.."" he fidgeted with the gun, awkward with it; he wasn't really the hunter sort and only taught himself to use the thing online for this very purpose.

Swinging his head back toward Tom, his greasy locks lifting in the stagnant air, Jason's eyes were just this creepy intense almost black that was as empty as a miscarriage. ""You know, do you? You think you know what I am going through? What in the hell could someone like you know? Driving around in your pretty little car with your pretty little wife and your pretty little children and grandchildren... come on man.. how the fuck could you know what its like to yearn SO BADLY to be able to take care of your family but your powerless to the rush from that poke in your arm or that crackle and sizzle through that glass?"". His voice shook as he spoke but it was almost spooky in the way that it sounded devoid of emotion, as if the man had forgotten how to feel or any emotions other then pain and shame.

Tom sounded distant when he spoke. ""Yes I've got money. Actually I've got a lot if it. But my wife and my daughter were taken from me 15 years ago and there's no getting them back. I'm alone. I've tried other women, I've tried joining groups but there is just nothing that can fill that void that I have inside that was carved out of my soul the day I lost Mixie and Diane."" His thoughts were racing but not on his upcoming release, he was wondering if he could somehow make a difference in this mans life, save him before giving up himself. ""I've got money, just like I said. I will give it to you, whatever you need.. you can have enough for your family to do well better than just getting by. You are so lucky to still have them man.. you've got the world before you. Take my car and get the hell out...""

The look on Jason's face could have squeezed water from a rock. So destitute, so alone when he was being offered anything he could possibly want. ""It wouldn't work man. Thank you but it wouldn't work. If I was in the picture the money you gave my family would go straight into my lungs and arms. You don't think I could use that much? Watch me. I've stolen shit from my own family, sold my damn food card letting my own damn kids go hungry. I'm a poor excuse of a man and an utter waste of a life. You on the other hand can still be happy. You can find love again. You can have anything that money could buy...""

""I can't buy my wife and daughters lives back""

Anonymous may be a loosely connected Groups of hacktivists that doesn’t appreciate governments keeping secrets or conducting operations that somehow violate user privacy. So, to register their enmity what they are doing is attack the agency’s systems and hack critically necessary information.

nasa

The same procedure was used by AN Anonymous-linked team of hackers known as New World Hacking and AnonCorruption once they learned that NASA was “holding back info on several things, not only one.”
NASA’s pc systems, allegedly, were attacked by New World Hacking team’s hacktivists and their supporters on Sunday night as a part of a much bigger campaign against government cover-ups known as Operation Censorship or #OPCensorship.

The hackers claimed that they need managed to finish off the Space agency’s primary web site and email servers. The attack was materialized through the foremost normally used weapon known as DDoS attack.

However, NASA’s web site was still found to be operational rather than being down as per the claims from the hacker group. But, the New World Hacking team provided proof, that advised that a number of the space agency’s systems were affected by the aftershocks of what’s termed as a digital war.

Remember, the NWH is that the same group WHO claimed responsibility for closing down Xbox on-line service,BBC news servers, HSBC UK’s on-line banking, the official web site for Donald Trump’s election campaign, Salt Lake town Police and airport websites.

“NWH hackers vow to focus on Trump in their next cyber attack”
While talking to HackRead, the group declared that NASA was attacked as a result of they were convinced that the agency has necessary data regarding the extremist organization ISIS however it’s withholding the knowledge. The group additionally refused to reveal the key info regarding ISIS.

The attack hasn’t been confirmed or denied by NASA and that we cannot probably verify if the hacktivists’ claims ar true or not since the website is functioning.

“We believe NASA is holding back data on several things, not only one. the most issue we tend to suspect they’re holding back some additional data on ISIS that the general public has to know.We won’t tell the general public what we predict they’re Hiding – we’ll let NASA justify.”

They additionally added that this attack is a lot of sort of a observe run the foremost necessary campaign against Donald Trump, that they commit to execute on April Fool’s day.

“We need Trump to understand that he’s next,” the hackers added ",googletops

I remember that day, well, this day, so vividly that I could recreate that moment whenever I felt like it. And I do. It begins at 7:00 pm on the dot. I wake up to a phone call, the familiar sound of ringing in my ears like the picture you always walk past in your living room. It's John. He's asking if I want to go to Taco Bell, probably for the thousandth time. I've lost count at this point. I wait outside, I see my breath in the cold winter air, is it the same breath I took the first time? Whatever, it makes no difference really. I glance at my phone. ""BREAKING NEWS: KANYE WEST WINS 2020 ELECTION IN LANDSLIDE VICTORY"". I love The Onion. John arrives, we high-five and make our way to feast on some ""authentic"" Mexican cuisine. It tastes good, so I guess I can't complain. We make our way to Taco Bell and talk about the movie we saw yesterday. ""Dude, I still can't believe that those two brothers stopped the Moon from crashing into the Earth. I wish I could watch it again, but I've already spent too much money this week."" Be careful of what you wish for, John. I've seen that movie so many times that it feels more like a routine than entertainment. We leave Taco Bell and John drops me off, an hour and a half left. I take the final sip of my drink, I savor every drip until I hear the inevitable sound of suction. I open the door to my house and immediately turn on Netflix. I've already seen everything it has to offer but I do love re-watching 30 Rock. I chuckle at all the same jokes, partly because it keeps me sane and partly because I still do find them funny. I look at the clock. Half an hour left. Well, I'm glad I used my time wisely. I always become so torn at this point. There's always a small part of me that hopes that time will just keep passing, that the clock will finally tick past 10:00, that I will finally see that damn stick move one more time. But, I know that the reality is that once that hand strikes 10, it's time for another round of this shit. I mean, it could be worse. I could be pushing a boulder up a hill for eternity, sucks to be that guy. I hear my phone ring again, it's time. It's my parents. ""Son, we love you and we want you to always know that, no matter what happens. Goodbye."" They hang up without giving me a a chance to speak. The first time it happened it worried me. Now I see it as an alarm. Still, I've always wondered what they meant by that. 15 minutes. In other lives, I've tried running away as fast as I could, I've tried killing myself first, but it never amounts to anything. They always get me first. If I die before 10 it just sends my back to 7 instantly, so I guess I have some minute control over things. But I don't see the point of doing that anymore. I might as well enjoy the time I have, doing productive things like eating tacos and watching shows. Hmm. Anyways, I've lost my train of thought. I look at the clock again, 5 minutes. Woops. I hear yells and screams from the neighbors, but I remain silent. I know what's coming. The ground shakes, but I remain mostly composed. I've fallen enough times to know where and how to stand. The darkness of night is shattered by violent, expanding light. It's still quite far away, so I still have some time left. These few minutes always feel like ages. Except this time, something feels different. I can't explain it, but I know something is off. 10 seconds. What? I'm sure I usually have more time than this? Wait, I don't, not really. But, I... I just don't know. Something has changed, and I have to take advantage of this in any way I can. I see it approaching. I always try to keep my eyes open but I always fail. Not this time. I keep them open even when every fiber of my being is telling me to keep them closed. I resist and for the first time in forever, I see it. A candle. ""HAPPY BIRTHDAY!"" they cheer, and I jump from the chair. ""Is something wrong, Jay?"" Yes, everything is wrong, I should be ash, I should be less than ash. I should be waking up on my couch, a phone call waiting for an answer. But not this time. I'm free. Of course, no one would believe me, but I tell them anyway. I see my father's expression change just the smallest fraction, but he quickly composes himself and cracks a joke at my reply to be accompanied by chuckles and hard laughter. Man, who invited Kevin? Regardless, I know something is up, and maybe I'll find answers someday. But for now, this tres leches is not going to eat itself.",windvoyager

""I said I need a favor."" The man before me seemed to be nothing special. Maybe even a little underwhelming, bearing pale skin, bloodshot eyes, and a suit that seemed too large for his brittle frame. Nonetheless, I could tell from the voice belonging to the husk that this was the patron we followed, this very same voice that whispered promises of power to us in our dreams.

""Well, pardon me for being surprised- but what could you possibly want from me? I understand who you are, and I'm sure you who I am."" I slowly sat down across from him in my recliner. I made sure to keep my eyes on him, cautious of what such a powerful being would need of an English professor...

""You're very observational, so you should see that I'm dying. I, as in my host. I ""'ve had this body for several years, and it was already frail. Now, you will be my new host.""

""I'm not in the mood for your efforts at stalling or dissuading me."" He glared. ""You promised me your eternal devotion with that blood pact and I intend on claiming what is due."" He coughed as he stood, pulling want looked to be a ceremonial dagger from his suit, slicing it down the cloth. the fallen fabric have a view of his bare chest, sickly and clammy with a long and stitched up wound, looking as if it was keeping in a beast trying to escape.

""Please, I'm sure I can find you a better host! Stronger and healthier than me!"" Dark tendrils started to poke from the old wound as he approached, the dagger in hand. I was too paralyzed with shock to even consider running. He seemed to be ready to chase me to the ends of the Earth if I tried. 

*""You will pay what is due*...""

[WP] You are a hacker. After punching through a couple of really odd servers you find yourself on the world wide web of an alien civilization.,neomodulus,"""DAMN IT"" Ray shouted out in frustration.

His roommate Sam stuck his head in the door frame. ""Get turned down again buddy? It happens to us all. Well except me of course"" 

""Fuck off, I could get a date if I wanted to."" Ray bantered back at Sam with a hint of annoyance mixed with jealousy. As odd a friends as they made they did get along well. Sam had been seeming to try and help Ray out on the dating front a little more lately but that was not why he was annoyed. 

They had known each other since grade 5 when a very awkward and lanky Sam moved into Ray's hometown. Ray had been your typical slightly pudgy nerd at the time and was at the bottom of the social ladder. As fellow outcasts in their small town they became fast friends. Ray coming up with the schemes and Sam helping to execute on them. Now they were sharing an apartment off campus in their third year of college. 

Sam was studying accounting and business after failing to make the cut on both the baseball and basketball teams in his freshman year. Ray on the other hand was coasting though his degree in software engineering. While not a slacker per say he did tend to get out of or only put in the bare minimum into the subjects that he had to do that held no interests for him. He wanted to spend as much time as he could with his tech to always be on the leading edge. That was his thrill, seeing what the latest and greatest was. Pushing it to its limit and seeing how things break. 

Bug bounties were getting harder to come by these days. They never paid the bills but would let him buy a round on him every once in a while and they were what allowed him to buy the latest tech year after year, to keep his room looking like a mad scientist's lair with, scopes, chip programmers and debugging interfaces piled high. With his latest project he was hoping to get a new round of ISP programmers and perhaps a few more higher end tools to work with. 

""So what were you doing?"" Sam interjected into Rays thoughts.

""I was trying to flash the new Samsung s8 with a new boot-loader and I bricked the phone"" replied Ray. Sam gave him a funny look. ""I tried to load a new OS on the phone and it went wrong now I have a worthless bit of plastic that will cost me $600 to replace"" Ray said to his friend. ""Got it, ... I think"" was Sam's answer. 

""Ok well I'm gonna go out to the bar tonight at 6. You should come. I'll even try to find someone to come along who can understand what you say when you nerd out"" Sam shouted as he walked out the front door. 

With Sam gone Ray turned back to the problem at hand. His extra cash fund was drained just about dry. He thought about how he could make some fast cash. He didn't want to go back to his old watering hole. No only trouble lay down that road. He could get arrested, kicked out of school or worse. Then he looked down at his new 600$ paper weight. I will be careful he thought. Verify targets, just a small bounty just a few hundred bucks should be small enough to keep him off anyone's radar. With that he got up.

He walked over to his closet and found an old backback from jr high one that most people would never look in and pulled out a small netbook, tossed it and a charger in his messenger bag and walked out the door. 

It really was like a drug for him. Cracking, seeing where things broke and how he used those breaks to slip smallest bits of code in that would eventually allow him access to everything. Breaking into the wrong computer these days could cost you your freedom. Those agencies with three letter names liked to be the only ones on the block to be able to access everything. So if someone beat them at their game they tended to take it personally. 

He grabbed a cup of coffee from the cafe on the ground floor of the apartment and headed to his car. After a few minutes he found himself in the parking lot of an unfamiliar grocery store in an unfamiliar but nice neighborhood. He booted up the netbook and a familiar R logo appeared on the screen. It would not appear familiar to anyone but Ray though. This was his own OS forked from the main linux 3.2 kernel. After a fingerprint and a password the boot up finished on his netbook. He opened up WPASnort and looked though the wireless access points he could reach. With a quick scan he found one that had not been patched and was quickly connected to the internet and then to TOR. A few more minutes later he found himself back in his old haunts, cracking boards, hacking boards. The more things change the more they seem the same. Dumb kids asking how to change grades, obvious plants by the feds trying to catch some dumb kids stupid enough to fall for their tricks so they could show the world they were doing something to stop the scary deep web. People trying to get nude photos off the web, people trying to get nude celebrity photos, the china online army trying to hack anything remotely anti china or pro taiwan. 

After a minute of reveling in his nostalgia he started looking though the boards for a quick job. Nothing major, no credit card theft or theft of personal details, something like owning a chat board, or taking down some site that spewed hate speech was what he was looking for. On page three he found it, Bingo he thought. Someone was wanting to take down some no name blogger running their own blog after getting banned from the usual hosted blogs. The pay was right at about 1500 bucks in bitcoins. That was the ticket, it would refill his fun money account and the only person harmed would be some nut job spouting off about the healing power of bee oil or how the Illuminati are lizard people running the world from the position of janitor or something. A quick message to the poster that he would do it and an address to send the bit coins to and it was time to go. He gulped down the last bit of coffee, exited everything, disconnected from TOR and then added the access point to his black list. He learned that the hard way never to use the same access point twice. He looked at his phone, 5:06pm he had been here only 15 minutes. If he hurried he could get back and shower and join Sam at the bar. Who knows maybe he will make good on his promise to find someone to talk nerd with him.

Ray  got back to the apartment, put the netbook back in the old backpack and jumped in the shower. He was thinking about the job at hand now. What tools he would use, would it be a windows server open to the world or would it be a secure out of the box linux box that was hard to make insecure if you wanted to. That was the real thrill, the anticipation, the slight pause of breath after the last command was entered to see if things went right and when they did the joy, of it was intoxicating to him. Having power over something that others thought was secure, the satisfaction of knowing he had bested someone at this game he played. The fall though was hard, when you were bested by someone else and the fear of the consequences if you failed to best someone. Once, when he first started, he didn’t fear anything it was the internet, he thought it the modern Wild West there was no law, it was survival of the fittest where the strong survived and the weak sought shelter far away behind firewalls and antiviruses.   

The water started to feel cold, and the temperature would not go higher no matter how hard on the handle he pushed. “Oh well time to get out” he said to no one but himself. He wandered into his room, towel around his waist and looked at the clock it was 6:05 already. “I never promised him I would come out to the bar tonight and I could get that recon work started” Ray thought to himself. Then he thought about it again, as much as an introvert as he was he still needed some human contact even if it was just being in the same room as other people while he sipped his beer and let Sam do all the talking. 

Ray grabbed a plain t-shirt that seemed to be clean and slipped on some nicer jeans he had gotten from goodwill. A female acquaintance of Sam’s had said that Ray looked good in them when she and Sam had set him up on a blind date years ago. The date had been a disaster but it was no big deal since Sam’s acquaintance, like most women Sam met, was out of his life in a few months never to be seen except for the occasional Facebook post exchanging the most surface level chat about how they should hang out again. 

On the way to O'Grady's he made a quick calculation and grabbed cash from the ATM, that would keep him from spending too much tonight besides he didn’t need the hangover. He walked into the bar at about 6:45, as he walked in and his eyes adjusted he took in the smell of the place, of old wood bars that had seen years of beers slid across them, the faint smell of old cigar smoke from before the indoor smoking bans. The kind of smell you would have to tear down the bar to get rid of.  Ahh yes, the smell calmed his nerves, he always had nerves when he was in a social situation. That smell always reminded him no matter what happened the bar and by extension the beer would always be here no matter what social faux pax he stumbled into. 

He walked over to the bar before looking for his friend and caught the bartender’s eye, older guy, never did catch his name with a beard and always seemed to be in the middle of one of the same five stories with the same 5 or 6 customers. He ordered his usual Guinness and put his cash on the bar. After the beer and the change came back he left the tip on the bar and wandered into the back room to find his friend.

He spotted Sam the instant he walked into the room but it was not hard since they were in the same corner booth as Sam usually was with a group of friends. Sam spotted Ray and waved him over. “Running on Ray standard time I see” Sam said with a smile. “Yeh well if I was not you would think I had replaced with a pod person” Ray kicked back to his old friend. 

After the quick greeting introductions were had. The girl cozied up to Sam was a good looking girl named Sarah Nguyen. Slightly shorter than Sam she was quickly deep into conversation with him again forgetting the rest of the booth was even there. Next to her was her friend Jessica something, the song had gotten louder when she said her name, and with the short spiked red hair, nose ring and general punk look she had going he was kind of afraid to ask what her last name was again. Next to her and next to Ray when he sat down was James McKim. James seemed like a nice enough guy, he had moved to the west coast from the Midwest for college. James struck up a conversation with Ray and Jessica. Topics wandered from sports to politics to jobs. Jessica seemed disinterested and seemed to be splitting her attention between making sure her friend stayed grounded around Sam and her phone. For most of the conversation James did  most of the talking since sports  was not Ray’s forte and the quick detour into politics proved the two of them didn’t have much in common when it came to political views. 

When the subject of jobs came up Ray tried to steer the conversation towards his IT work and hoping to find a sympathetic ear told him of his woes with the latest S8 laying bricked at his house. Quickly James got that same glazed look that Sam got when telling him of his latest tech issues. After a few minutes of awkward silence James excused himself to grab another beer.  Oh well another boring night of drinking thought Ray as he kicked himself for not having more social graces. He started to wonder if he did a few shots if he could understand getting so into sports you don’t play.

“The JTAG header” 

Huh thought Ray as he looked around for who had said that. A quick turn of the head to see if someone from the next booth over had said something but it was empty. He started to wonder if he himself had said it and didn’t know it.   

“Have you tried the JTAG header?” Sarah said looking up from her phone 

Now it was Ray’s turn to be awkward, “No” he stammered, still wondering if he should be scared of Jessica or not. 

“Well why not?” She demanded putting her phone down and looking interested in something for the first time the whole night.

Now that he finally found he mental footing, Ray answered back with more confidence, “There is no JTAG header on the S8” 

“It’s part of the same Snapdragon processor family that the S7 used, they didn’t change the pin out of the chip so logically it should be there” She shot back. 

Ray looked over Jessica’s shoulder to see his friend smile just a little more than he should have at that exchange. Motherfucker, she was the one he brought to talk nerd with me, and he didn’t warn me at all. Asshole, I bet he has been waiting for this all night and he will be laughing his head off about it later. 

Refocusing on Jessica, Ray answered back “That’s right but they didn’t bring the pins out on to the board for us to access. So I didn’t even think to try accessing it though the JTAG interface” 

“So bring the pins out.” She said as if explaining things to a third grader.

“Ok, I’ll bite how?” Ray said. He knew that the pins they needed were in the middle of the pin array that attached the processor to the board and impossible to access without removing the processor from the board. 

“You shim the processor” she said with a grin. 

Ray’s mind raced, how could she shim the processor without getting those tiny soldered contacts out of place or shorted out and still get the JTAG interface out. Even if you could get some kind of contact in there on the JTAG pins you would still have to get the traces out to a contact pad and how could do that and get though those rows of contact points.

After a moment of silence as Ray pondered this information, Jessica spoke up.  “Excuse me could I get past you I need to grab a cigarette”  

After he sat back down, Jessica looked at him and asked “would care to join me for a smoke?” 

“No I’ll pass” he said still deep in thought.  “Ok suit yourself” she replied as she walked toward the front door. 

When Ray looked up Sam and Sarah were looking at him giving him a dumb look. “What? I don’t smoke ok?” 

Sarah looked at him and said “Neither does she.” 

A moment of recognition passed over Ray. “SHIT!” he said as he jumped up from the table leaving a half a beer warming on the table.

"[WP] ""That's when I realized, I wasn't the hero, she/he was.""",pastorjake,"I held the ledgendary sword in two clenched hands. My next move would be the start of my hero's legacy, or the worst mistake I could make. My companion, with her drunken way of moving and eyes sewn shut just kept staring at my opponent, mouth curled upwards into the frightening grin that haunts one's dreams. Nightmarish garments adorned her slim figure, each one bearing a dull colour to compliment her brown hair tied in a plait that tumbled to the marble tiles covering the floor.

""This is it,"" I whisper to her delicate frame. All she, Estelle, does is tilt her head in confusion.

Yelling a battle cry, I charge straight towards the structure before me, a creamy egg speckled with disease. As soon as my weapon pierces its soft skin the egg burst into glistening green flames, glowing with a elegant purple aura. My armour clicks as I dash away from the demon's flames.

I signal towards Estelle, who in turn mutters an incantation. Holy water splashes onto the fire, revealing a dragon severely disease. To see such a beautiful creature demoted to this hideous beast- no, I would not lose.

Weapon in hand, I slashed and backed away at its scaly hide, but nothing seemed to work. I hit the eyes, the tail, I even got a lucky shot on the front of its belly, but it was all in vain. However, I was the chosen one, and I must succeed without fail.

It still didn't work. It was immune to everything I tried, and as the sword became increasingly heavier in the heart and my hands, I finally yielded. Perhaps I was not the hero I thought I was.

Estelle approaches my panting figure. She lifts the golden sword from my hands and I feel so free, so careless without a worry in the world. High above her head she raises it, bringing it down in a motion that slashes right through my chest.

Wait.

Bloods seeps out of the wound and up my, her blade. Spells dart through the cavern and the witch girl calmly approaches the dragon. Yelling some words and with a swift swipe, the dragon's head comes clean off.

That's when I realised, I wasn't the hero, she was.

I was dizzy. The blood loss had left me weak and lightheaded. The last moments in the world were not plesant.

Open, scarlet bloodshot eyes bore into my own. I saw my fears and hopes all at once.

It was as though my soul was being scrapped against coastal rocks, pressing at me until the only sensation I *could* feel was the ability to think - and to see.

A presence overbears itself in my mind, dismay piercing.

*Looks like you're in a little scrape.* It sounds a hearty chuckle. I'm alarmed.

**Get *out* of me!**

*Not so fast.*

I throw myself, somehow, against the barriers of my no mind. Within the first attempt I already know it's futile. The hold is too strong. I relent.

**Don't hurt me.**

*I can guarantee that, but anybody else?*

As though right on cue, the front door slams, hard enough to rattle the windows in the kitchen I - we, were currently stood in. It's enough to that whatever demonic entity is posessing me has been silenced by it. 

Then there's a yell of my name followed by obscenities, before my boyfriend charges into the kitchen. He's livid.

""What do you think you're doing? I said to have my dinner ready, you useless *bitch*!""

We stand there, staring. This only serves to aggravate him. He stomps forward and gives my body a hard shove, enough to make it stumble against the cupboards. He slaps me.

""Don't just fucking stand there, what did I just---""

I only realise that I'm holding the strong spice grinder when he sprawls out on the floor beneath me. We stare down at the man for a long few moments; almost casually, the entity leans down to press two fingers against his pulse. Nothing.

""He's dead."" My voice says, and something in me sags, but also lifts at the same time. He's dead. My next words come out before I can really chew them.

*Thank you.*

I could hear Lance shouting that I ""got this"", as my arms started to tremble. The moment that *he* reached ""twelve"", I slammed the barbell back into the rack. The two boys on either side of me cheered and grasped at my trembling arms, helping me back onto my feet.

Jamie insisted that *that was sweet, bro*.

""Yeah... you too..."", I uttered breathlessly. Lance jeered at the reply, stopping just short of literally ribbing me. While they enthusiastically recounted how far I had come in *just one year*, I turned around to look at the weight.

""It's true"", *his* voice sounded in the back of my head. ""*You*"", *he* stressed this first word, ""have come so far"". A soft chuckle swelled through my mind, as a rush of dopamine and adrenaline tickled my insides.

----------

I wasn't sure what I had said that summoned him, but before I could even look surprised, *he* had shoved me back from the ledge.

Sprawled out on the ground, I could only look up and stare. Giant leathery wings framing a sinewy body. A jagged face pierced with two murky golden eyes. Flames from his sword casting his body in harsh shadows. He flapped his wings, gently, keeping himself afloat over the river.

""*You*,"" his voice boomed, ""summoned Meristosthenes the Defiler, of the Eighth Realm?""

The bridge trembled as he perched himself on the guard rail. As a siren wailed in the background, Meristosthenes stood upright and gazed off into the distance. 

""It isn't for you. Your parents don't find your..."" his eyes narrowed, ""letter... for several hours.""

""What-,"" I stumbled over my words for a moment. ""What's wrong with my letter?""

He snorted, derisively. ""I am but a shadow that you all ignore. I have spent forever,"" he spoke in a shrill falsetto, ""cowering in the shadows while you all enjoyed the light. I would have done *anything* to have had but *one* friend in this absurd pyramid that *you* all call society."" His normal voice returned. ""Me me me, its no wonder-""

""Well I *would* have,"" I pushed myself up off of the ground.

His voice was softer this time, ""You *scarcely* tried.""

""I *tried* making friends at the school paper! But all they talk about is the *Divergent* series."" I scowled. ""That book is so *stupid*-""

""Ah yes,"" he cooed, ""I remember the article that you *wanted* to write about it. *Diverging from Quality*"", despite not having pupils, he seemed to roll his eyes anyway.

""Stop that! How do you even *know* this stuff, anyway?""

""You were right. She never would have published it.""

""See? I go to school with *idiots*!""

""But she would *spoken* with you about it,"" he seemed to recoil at the word *spoken*, ""and you two would *argued* about it,"" he glared at me again. ""And *you* would have folded.""

My muscles clenched. He continued.

""You *should* have written the article, but you *didn't* because you were so afraid of losing that fight.""

""I can't-""

""You've done nothing but dodge conflict and avoid fights since you were eight years old. *You* say that your favorite book is the *Lord of the Rings*,"" he grinned, ""and you haven't even read the third one.""

Mouth agape, I put my hand down, realizing that I had been stabbing my finger at his face.

He continued. ""Your favorite books are *actually* the *Magician* series, but you don't tell your little friends because-""

""They *aren't* my friends.""

""-because they definitely haven't even heard of it. And then you'd have to *convince* them to read it."" His grin turned sour. ""And if they don't like it, then you would be *so embarrassed* at liking something *so unpopular*.""

The siren faded into nothingness.

""What would-"".

""Meristosthenes.""

My face flushed. ""What would *you* even know about any of this? Where were you when I couldn't find a date for the Spring Dance? Where were you when I was home last night, crying myself to sleep, unable to even-""

""I know sin, and you are covered in it?""

""What did *I* do?"" I wailed. ""Why not bother Scott for knocking down my books? Or Lance for tripping me? Or Stacy for-""

""Your dictionaries define pride as *the quality of having an excessively high opinion of oneself or one's importance*."" He paused for a moment. 

""*Stacy* doesn't even known your name. And when you throw yourself from this bridge, when you survive the fall, change your mind, and doggy-paddle your way to the shore for ten minutes before finally drowning, you imagine her weeping at your funeral.

""And she doesn't.""

I could see my breath, hanging in the air.

""What are you doing here?"" I asked.

""I'm here to make you a deal."" His sword vanished as he took a step towards me. ""If you are going to make pride your sin, then you should learn to do it correctly.

""Let me inhabit your body, and I will show you what pride actually looks like.""

----------

My arms throbbed as I flopped onto my bed. I had the house to myself for the moment, but all I wanted to do was take a nap. As my clock ticked softly, a fond memory from the past month replayed itself in my mind.

""Aren't you forgetting something?"" *his* voice spilled over my inner thoughts.

Slowly, I rolled up onto my feet and pulled a pouch out of my nightstand. A glimmer of afternoon sun sparkled off of the bottle as I filled the syringe. As I prepared to inject, my fingered wavered for a moment.

""You can sleep when you're done.""

Once more, a soft chuckle swelled through my mind, as the familiar touch of dopamine and adrenaline kissed my insides.",_wafflecopter

"[WP] A demon possesses you and you're forced to watch as it makes your life...weirdly, way better than it was.",saralancer,"It all started a few months ago.

This cute girl had just started working in the office, just a few cubicles down from mine. Every time I got up to get a cup of water I walked right by her, and our eyes would meet. I was too shy to maintain eye contact for long, but there were a few times I could swear I saw a hint of a smile form in her lips.

Some time later, our company decided to host a dinner. Despite whatever excuse I made to avoid going to that ""get-together"", I was forced to go by my pushy and extrovert coworker, Paul. While everyone else was drinking and yelling at the table, I went outside for a smoke, in order to clear my head and get away from all the noise and confusion. Surprisingly, I wasn't the only one with that in mind. That girl was there too. She didn't like the yelling fest either, she only came because she thought it would be a nice way to connect with her coworkers. She certainly was expecting a booze-fueled loudness war. We ended up talking for quite a bit, exchanged cellphone numbers and I promised to text her when I had the chance.

We ended up hitting it off, and she invited me to a small ""get-together"" with a group of her friends. I wasn't really sure what that was, but she seemed like the type of girl who enjoyed talking about current events over a cup of tea, and that's the sort of thing I'm into as well.

What I did not expect, however, was to be part of a demonic ritual. I went to her place and there was this weird, pentagram-like thing written in chalk on her floor. I asked about it and she said ""It's for the ritual"". I was freaked out and tried to leave, but she begged me to stay, said she really needed me for this. Being unused to a girl needing me, I decided to stay. She only needed me to speak a couple sentences anyway. Afterwards I could go home and never communicate with this weirdo ever again.

Me, her and a few of her friends sat around the pentagram.  We said a few words, some dude who seemed very experienced in this sort of thing placed some weird rock on the middle of the symbol and then, shit got weird. The pentagram started glowing, and I felt *something*. I didn't know what it was, but it didn't feel good. Smoke started to rise from the ground, and I could have sworn I saw a pair of red eyes glaring at me. Then I heard a *BOOM* sound and I felt a huge force hitting me in the face, knocking me back. Shocked by what I had just experienced, I did what any grown man would do in this situation. I yelled ""WHAT THE FUCK"" and ran for the door, opened it, and I sprinted out of that place and never looked back.

A few days later, I woke up but my body felt weird. I couldn't move it no matter how much I tried. Then I heard a voice in my head. ""Hello human, I have decided to take over your body. You should feel honored, now sit back and enjoy the ride"". I tried to scream but no sound came out. In fact, my mouth didn't even move, like it wasn't mine anymore. Then my body began moving on its own. It got up, dressed and went to work. I was freaking in my mind. How did this happen? Who was that voice? Then I remembered the ""incident"". I had read some stories about demonic possession online, but didn't pay much attention to it. Right now though, it seemed obvious those lunatics had somehow managed to summon a demon back then and it took over my body. I tried fighting back but there was nothing I could do, not a single muscle I could move. Even my mental shouts were ignored. I could only watch what this demon was about to do with my life.

I saw my body go to work and... do everything ten times faster and better than I ever did. All my work was done by lunch, and it was so good my manager praised it. It was weird seeing something that wasn't an insult come out of that fat bastard's mouth. In the afternoon, since it had nothing more to do, the demon-me spent its time looking for better jobs online. It even contacted a few companies and scheduled some interviews. By 7pm, I was at a bar talking with this gorgeous girl, and I could feel she was really into me. Half an hour later, she was in my apartment and were... you know. 

By the time a month had passed, I had a job that paid three times my previous one and was much more pleasant. I slept with a different woman every night and everyone around me loved me. Well, loved the demon-me. Over time, the fear I had was replaced with amazement. I couldn't believe how a demon could make my life so much better. And after that, came despair. This wasn't my life, it was his. They were speaking my name, but they liked him, not me. Everything I wished to have was right in front of me, but I could not touch it. I felt like killing myself to make it end, but I couldn't.

One day, my body was standing in my house, drinking a glass of scotch, when suddenly I heard a familiar voice in my head. ""Do you enjoy all of these things?"" How can I even enjoy something I can see but never touch? ""Well I can give you your life back."" Yes, please I'll do anything! ""I just need to do one more thing."" He got up, and walked towards the window. ""Once this is over, this body is all yours"". 

But why? Why did you possess me? And why are you leaving after improving my life so much? ""I'm a demon, my dear. Did you really think I was only here to make your life better?""

""But why?!"" These escaped my mouth. I then realized I had my body back, I could move again. Then I looked forward, and I was dumbstruck.

The world outside, the world I saw everyday, was no longer grey as the buildings that made it and blue like the sky. No, it was red. Red, as it was consumed in flames and drowned in the screams of those sheltered for so long.

We squatted, deadlifted, bench-pressed, and did other exercises until my body felt like spaghetti. 

We ate a huge breakfast. I think Htzu felt sorry for me, because afterward it took me to Home Depot, and I showed it how to re-tile the downstairs bathroom. I began to feel better, and would have hummed if I had any control over my body.

As we were grouting, Htzu said, “Why do you not do this for your work? You find it enjoyable.”

*My parents wanted me to go to college,* I thought. *They wanted the best for me, and worked hard to give me opportunities that they never had.*

“Your parents do not live your life. Your work is part of your poverty. You will not go there again.” Htzu was learning to use tone in its speech, and those words sounded pretty final. I thought of Dave, and the report that he would never get.

The grout-gun became still.

“We may go if you wish to defeat Dave,” it said, slyly. “It is your choice.”

In our morning roundup my boss had told me in no uncertain terms that he wanted it on his desk by five o’clock, with the strong implication that there would be hell to pay if it wasn’t done. Originally the deadline had been the following Wednesday, so I’d dropped everything else I was working on to get it done. It seemed to me this sort of thing happened a lot, but I take pride in being a flexible worker. 

I printed my summary and projections of the timeline for the proposed project, and the manpower it required, and made my way to Brad’s office. I poked my head around the door and smiled.

“Hey Brad, I have the figures on the Shutzfield project you wanted.” He was on the phone and held his hand out for the folder. I handed it over and sat down to wait. 

“Uh huh,” he said, looking over my work. “Yes. That’s what I said.” He frowned. “No!” he exploded. “I told you people Saturday! Don’t you listen?” 

Apparently he didn’t like the response he got. “Call me back when you get your head out of your ass! Get it right or we’ll find someone else.” He slammed the phone down in its cradle.

“Caterers,” he muttered. He quickly flipped through my report, then looked at me. “Jones, what the fuck is this?”

“The report you asked for,” I said. 

He sighed, and gave me a filthy look. “I didn’t want the Shutzfield report! I wanted the Forest Corner report! Are you stupid?”

I knew it wouldn’t do any good to show him the followup email he had sent me after the morning meeting. He had sent me the Shutzfield data.

“Well, I can do the Forest Corner report, it’s not a problem,” I said, unwisely.

“You don’t think it’s a problem. Well, of course you don’t. You just walk around here with your head in the clouds, no clue what’s going on. Get me that report first thing Monday morning, or you’re fired.”

I nodded and got up. There went our camping trip for the weekend. I just hoped Cindy wasn’t too disappointed.

“And I’m not paying you overtime!” he shouted after me as I walked back to my desk. I made sure I had the raw data for the Forest Center project, and decided to spend an hour getting started. Cindy wouldn’t be home yet anyway.
Two hours later, I left. The sky was still overcast from the earlier storms, but the sun peeked out from behind a cloud as I walked to my car. The grass sparkled, and my spirits lifted. Enjoying the beautiful scene, I failed to see the mud puddle, and soaked my shoes. 

Maybe Brad was right.

*****

The power was out, and Cindy still wasn’t home. I checked my phone, but she hadn’t sent me any messages. She told me once that she saw me all the time, and therefore didn’t need to text me constantly. I often wished she would text me at least when she was going to be late, but I was a respectful partner and accepted her need for space. I still felt wistful sometimes, sitting on the couch with her watching television, myself with a bowl of popcorn and Cindy with her phone, texting away with her friends. 

I’d planned to make her a nice dinner, but without power there was really no way to do it. She liked to go out, though, so probably wouldn’t be unhappy going to a restaurant. 

I peeled my wet shoes and socks off and left them just inside the front door. The house was dark and quiet, but there was still enough light coming through the windows that I could see. I made my way to the kitchen, picking up my girlfriend’s clothes off the floor as I went. 

The worn hardwood floors creaked as I walked. Cindy said the house was creepy, but I told her that it was an old house, and old houses make lots of noises. I thought it had character, and loved nothing better than spending an afternoon fixing it up. Cindy said it was a shithole.

There were candles in one of the kitchen cupboards, I was sure of it. I rummaged inside them, finding the candles but knocking a wine glass onto the floor in the process. It shattered on the floor, which made me drop the candles.

I bent to get them, and cut my hand on the glass. 

“It’s not my day,” I sighed. I found a book of matches, and my phone chimed.

*Going out with the girls. Be back late. Love you!*

It seemed I’d be eating alone. I stood in my dark kitchen, and a wave of loneliness washed over me. 

“I’d give a year of my life to be a different person,” I said. I lit the candle and sneezed.

“Done,” I said. “Your blood is your bond, the flame is my promise.”

“What?” I tried to say, but nothing came out. I felt dizzy, and suddenly my body was walking out of the kitchen, ignoring my attempts to stop moving.

While I panicked and tried to regain control of myself, my body went into the downstairs bathroom. It approached the mirror, and I saw my hand rise to my face and turn it this way and that.

“Weak,” I heard myself say. “I will fix you.”

It continued exploring the house, looking into every room. By the time it had finished, its last stop our bedroom, I was nearly over my terror and resigned to my fate. It stood in the bedroom, and I could hear it sniffing for a long time. I felt my nostrils flare and collapse again and again. Everything smelled as usual to me.

By then I thought I had it figured out. Somehow when I had lit the candle, and made my foolish wish, I had made a deal with the devil.

“Not devil,” my body said. 

It could hear me! I concentrated.

*Who are you?*

“Htzu,” it said. “You are in poverty.”

*Not really, I have a good job. This house went for a song, it just needs to be fixed up…*

“Not the house,” said Htzu. “Where do you gamble?”

*Gamble? I don’t gamble.* I thought of racetracks. There were none where I lived. Cindy liked to buy lottery tickets sometimes, but I had never bought any myself, knowing it was a losing proposition.

“Yes. We will do that.” Htzu strode to my dresser and stripped the clothes from my body with a brisk efficiency. I couldn’t help but notice that it dropped my clothes on the floor. I winced inwardly, and Htzu stopped and stood very still for a moment. Then it slowly bent, picked up my mud-spattered slacks and shirt, and carried them to the hamper.

“You are tidy,” it said. “It is good. I will learn to be tidy. We will learn, together.”

My fear began to ebb. Htzu dressed me in jeans, a t-shirt, and hiking boots, and briskly went downstairs.

I had to teach it how to drive, but it learned very quickly. It took me to a gas station and looked at the lottery tickets displayed under the glass counter. 

“A number 5. Two number 15’s. One number 20,” it told the clerk. After some prompting from me, it added, “Please.”

We won over two hundred dollars, and then Htzu was hungry.

*What do you like to eat?*

“Meat,” Htzu said. I sensed that I didn’t really want to ask more questions.

*Oh. Well, there is a steakhouse close by that’s pretty good. Drive west.*

Dinner wasn’t as bad as I feared, even though I spent a few desperate moments explaining why it couldn’t order its steak raw. We compromised on rare, and it stuffed me full of food. I was surprised that we both enjoyed it.

Then we went home. My body sat in an armchair in the living room. I found it a little unnerving that when it wasn’t moving, Htzu was almost completely still. 

*What are we doing?*

“Waiting,” it said. “I will rid you of your poverty.” I felt uneasy, but asked no more questions.

We sat in darkness, and Htzu made no reaction when the power returned. Sometime after that, headlights splashed across the walls of the living room. Cindy was home.

When she came in the door, Htzu turned its head toward her, and I began to worry. I loved Cindy very much, and I hoped that Htzu wouldn’t be tempted to harm her.

“Hi, honey,” she said, dropping her bag on the floor. “Boy, it’s late...” She looked at me and trailed off. I felt my nostrils flare again.

“You do not live here.” 

*No, Htzu, please don’t,* I begged.

“What? What are you talking about?” 

“You are not faithful. I smell another man on you. I smell men in our bedroom. You have had them here.”

I reeled. It couldn’t be true. 

“How did you find out?” she whispered. If I had been in control of my body, I would have staggered. I couldn’t believe it. 

“You will leave, now.”

“I’m so sorry, baby,” she said, tears beginning to run down her cheeks. “We can work this out.” She reached for me. I would have drawn away, but Htzu reached for her and held her by her wrist. 

“I’ve just felt so neglected,” she began.

Anger flared in me, and it seemed in Htzu, too. “You are unfaithful,” it roared into her face. “You will leave, and I will grind your things into the mud outside! Collect them tomorrow, and be careful I am not here or I will grind you, too! I will rend you from limb to limb and then I will burn you! I will crack your bones and suck the marrow!”

I heard a growling sound that my body could never have made on its own. It shocked me, and decided Cindy. She fled, her tires squealing on the pavement.

I was quiet. The growling stopped after a couple of minutes.

“You have less poverty now,” said Htzu at a normal volume. “We must sleep. Tomorrow we have much to do.”

The sudden voice wrenched me from my dreams and brought my mind crashing back to reality. With muscles involuntarily exploding, I hopped out of bed and onto my feet. I looked around for the source of the commanding tone before feeling quite silly. Of course it was just part of my dream. What an unusual dream.

*Wrong, buddy. I am not the stuff of dreams, but of nightmares!*

It was as if someone was standing directly behind me yelling at the back of my head and darting out of view as I turned to look.

*You won't be able to see me that way.*

""What the fuck..."" I let slip as my head swiveled checking every corner of the room. I was genuinely creeped out. This did not feel like a dream; the voice was so real.

""Who... Who's there?"" Sheepishly, I ask of my empty surroundings. 

*He doesn't remember.* Another, higher pitched voice, cackled somewhere behind my left ear. *You were right Mal, their minds are squishy, so easily molded.*

""Remember what?"" I blurted out as I tried to recall what I had done the previous day. A dozen empty beer cans lay discarded in the bin, a testament to the lack of things to remember. I had spent the entire day playing games and browsing the internet. 

*He heard that?* The voice was much quieter this time but still audible.

"[WP] A demon possesses you and you're forced to watch as it makes your life...weirdly, way better than it was.",saralancer,"I never thought I was lucky 

Even on my best of days I would find myself in impossibly miserable situations. I have even been struck by lightning. It was a clear and sunny day, but out of nowhere, as I trotted home, a freak storm blew in. The last thing I remember is pain, and then I was waking on the operating table. Well, fast forward six months of intensive care, the doctors discharged me saying it was a miracle I was alive; they said I was ""lucky"" to be alive. I didn't feel lucky and neither did my family, up to their necks in medical bills.

Aside from that incident, my horrendous luck made it next to impossible to finish school, get/keep a job, or even really have friends. Needless to say, I thought I was cursed, and by all accounts so did everyone. 

One day, I had the bright idea to ask my family why they thought I couldn't get my life together. My sister said it was karma, my father said it was stupidity, my mother said it was God's plan at work. I don't know if my mom was right, but it got me thinking, what was God's plan and why me.

I began researching the occult. Long story short, I found a...""spell"" (for lack of a better term) that could help me. It was designed to circumvent fate, God's plan if you will. Of course, I should have known that such a thing had a cost. Again long story short, used the spell and made a pact with a shadowy figure who seemed to come from the darkness under my bed. 

The shadow figure, Bartholomew (got his name later), took over my body and mind as soon as the pact was signed. Instantly I regretted my decision as I felt his will exert control. It was strange, having by body act against my will, to think thoughts that weren't my own. I was so afraid at first, I honestly thought Bartholomew was going to kill everyone in my house, then leave me rotting in prison (you know classic horror shit).

But he didn't. No, Bartholomew did exactly what I asked. He made my life perfect. The immediate next day he took a small loan out and started taking technical classes. six months in, he had a nice but hectic job as an EMT, he had his own place, and he had even met a nice girl at work. 

You would think I would be happy about that, right? I thought that it was nice at first, just have Bartholomew do all the work, and I get to enjoy the fruits of his labor whenever he falls asleep and I can reassert control (like now). But I am not happy. Before Bartholomew, I used to think that nothing worked because I was cursed...born unlucky, die unlucky. But with Bartholomew, everyday is a 24 hour stream forcing me to realize that I wasn't cursed, I was weak.

Bartholomew is a good son, a good brother, and don't even get me started on lover. He is everything I should have been, what I could have been had I confronted fate rather than circumvented it. Anyways, I have about four hours to kill before he wakes up again (he gets up early to run, the bastard).",Wearethestory

"[WP] A demon possesses you and you're forced to watch as it makes your life...weirdly, way better than it was.",saralancer,"I was always a shy kid. Never standing up for myself. Always letting opportunities pass me by. Never giving it my all because I was always afraid to fail. I was a living cliché. That all change the day I met him. Thats a day I'll never forget, despite my best efforts.

Late one night I was persuing my interests in the occult. I was the typical edgy teen. I was sporting some tight jeans, a black MCR shirt, and an asymmetrical fringe. Hey it was the mid-2000s. Anyway my edgy self was researching ways in which I can better commune with my inner faerie vampire-wolf. His name was Alistair. He loved silver objects, the blood of virgins, the full moon, and MCR. He was everything and nothing. He was both my dream and my reality. Some days I couldn't tell where he ended and I began. 

There was the typical church of satan Anton LaVey fanboyism. I've read it all a million times before. At that age I believed that everyone was full of it but me. I increasingly mistrusted and rebelled against the words of humans more and more  over the previous few months. It got to the point where I sat by myself at lunch in school and growled at anyone who came near. A point where I drank my own blood instead eating food. A point where I only answered to the name Alistair. The school therapist put me on Meds that made me light headed and my dreams bizarre. Of course my parents couldn't care less. Too busy hitting each other and breaking our property. 

I posted a question on one of the otherkin sites about my query. I mentioned that I didn't trust the words of humans who were disconnected from their spirit animals. Only someone who was at one with their animal selves knew the truth, or so I believed. That's when I got a message back, almost straight away. It was from a user called Alistair. His avatar pic was that of a strange looking wolf.

""You wish to commune with your spirit animal human?"" asked Alistair. ""Firstly what is his name? Secondly, what is his species?"". 

""His name is Alstair, like yours."" I replied. ""He is a faerie vampire-wolf"". A realisation struck me ""are you a faerie vampire-wolf as well?"" I asked.

""Why yes I am"" 

""Who the fuck are you!? Do you know me in real life!? Who put you up to this!?"" I bombarded Alistair with a barrage of questions. I wasn't sure if I wanted to know the answer to them.

""I told you already, I'm Alistair"" replied Alistair promptly. ""And yes I do know you in real life"" he continued. ""Lastly, it was you. You put me up to this"".

""But how!? I've never chatted with you before. Seriously who put you up to this? It's not funny! THESE ARE MY DEEPEST BELIEFS YOU FUCKING NAZIS!"" I unleashed the fury of my keyboard unto him.

""You chat with me all the time human, for I am Alistair"". There was a brief pause before he wrote on further. ""I know how you talk to me when you're alone, how you drink your own blood in an effort to satisfy my hunger, what your views on Anton LaVey are, I even know about how you burned your penis when you masturbated with shampoo a half hour ago"".

""WTF dude"" I replied. I was beyond shocked but I had to know more.

""I am your spirit animal, you wished to commune with me and now you have. What is it that you wish of me?"" he asked.

""Alistair, I wish to be a part of you. More than anything I want us to be one"" I replied in earnest.

""That is impossible for you are you and I am me"". 

""But you've taken over my body before"".

""That wasn't me. That was you pretending to be me"".

""I don't understand"". 

""You will in time human. For now all you need to know is that you can trust me. I'm here to help you"". 

This was the strangest chat I've ever been in and Ive been involved in some seriously screwed up online shit before then. Despite this, I kept my cool ""OK then Alistair, what exactly do I need help with?""

""Everything, your life is a mess.""

""I know.""

""Good news. I'm here to do what you wanted me to. I'm going to be more a part of you, at least for a time.""

""What do you mean?""

""Draw a pentagram on your arm, write a capital A in the middle, and chant my name three times. Afterwards go and lay down on your bed. You will fall asleep instantly. Do it now or it will not work"".

""You seem like the real deal so yeah, I'll do what you say, for now. I've always liked performing new rituals anyway"".

""Good, now off you go!""

Alistair logged off. I was very superstitious at that age so I did exactly what he instructed. Upon awakening the next day I was surprised to find that his ritual worked. I did fall asleep as soon as I layed down on my bed. That was the start of many surprises that day.

The Life and Times of Malik 

Part 1

The bull spun right and kicked its rear legs in the air and then spun left and leaped. Malik,, though only 15 and not the biggest boy for his age, was holding on much longer than most of the young men from the town of Obsula. Obsula was a smaller county pledged to Aranir that was nestled between the Culvenian Mountains and Western sea. The mountains had always protected the various Culven cultures from being swept up in the many disputes between the kingdoms, city-states, and alliances to the east. This protection had allowed such festivities as this. Obsula’s primary economy was its cattle that grazed in the foothills of the Culvenian Mountains and drank from the fresh mountain streams running down. Nobody knows how this tradition started. Some say the first man to step foot west of the Culvenian mountains came upon a wild herd of cattle and tamed the biggest bull by riding it and that was how they had come to domesticate such beasts. Others said it was simply a drunken cattle herder who mistook his bull for his horse. Still others say it was simply bored young men looking for something to excite them. At any rate it was a yearly tradition for all the counties that pledged allegiance to Aranir to come together for this competition during the cattle markets. Malik, being the heir to Obsula, sought to bring some recognition to his small county. It had seemed like an eternity of holding on to the beast for Malik. He wasn’t as strong as the others, but he had studied and watched this particular bull before. Malik knew its tenancies. He prepared in advance for each turn or leap. Finally his arms gave way and he was thrown off the rear. Malik rolled through the sand trying to miss the bull’s stomps. Finally he got up and ran to jump out of the pit. Adrenaline rushing he wasn’t even aware of his soreness. Shouts arose for such a young competitor. “I lasted the full length, didn’t I!?” he shouted to his father, Basilik. Basilik let out a laugh. “Not quite. You left at least a quarter of the sand in the glass before you fell.” Malik threw off his gloves in disgust. “It felt like forever” he said. Basilik took him by the shoulder. “My son, you must show more grace. You represent your family and your people. You are the youngest competitor in many years and you have out rode most of your competition. You have many years ahead of you. You will win the tournament one day without a doubt.” Malik remained silent. “You must come with me. The governors are meeting and you are almost full grown. You need to learn how to conduct yourself in these diplomatic situations.” “You always complain of how dull they are”  Malik responded. “This is true, yet they are still important. This one I fear may not be so dull, however” his father said cautiously. Malik perked up and said, “Well what do you mean?” Basilik in a hushed tone responded, “We shall see, but I fear we may be unwillingly drug into the ongoing wars between the states to the North.” “But we have never been involved in the feuds. We stick to ourselves. Does this mean we must call the banners and march to war?” Malik said excitedly. “Shoosh! Not another word till we are in the meeting. And try not to look so excited about the prospect of death and destruction. War is not as wonderful as the stories would have you believe.” Basilik and Malik walked up the hill toward the Walls of Aranir in silence. The governer’s meeting would take place in the Lord of Aranir’s meeting counsel on the West end of the city overlooking the Western Sea. Governors would meet at least once a year, though sometimes more often than that to settle disputes and broker deals of various kinds. Usually the meetings were not of much significance, but there was an unease in the air as they walked into the room this year. The states of Esi, Arnel, Seist, Xill, and Pacen had been in a prolonged war. Esi, Arnel, and Seist and originally been a single nation, but had broken up in a civil war shortly after the ever expanding Distenian Empire had seized the city of Renmar from the Kingdom of Xill. There were whispers that Distenia had been sowing seeds of rebellion for years to weaken the once strong country so that they might absorb them into their empire more easily. It was not hard to guess why Distenia might want to expand to the south. Their only major port on the Western Sea was in Novodon, which was completely frozen over for much of the year. The city of Seistus had sided with Xill to try and win Renmar back for them because the lord of Seist had married off his daughter to the prince of Xill.

"[IP] This map represents years of work, please just go absolutely mad.",Cjelliott13,"""Sold! For seventy serpent rupia to this fine gentleman!"" yelled the slaver. 

A rather portly and middle aged man emerged from the gathered crowd. He hurriedly strode up the stairs of the auction stage. His eagerness rivalled only by his greed. The portly gentleman thrusted a sizeable bag of coins into the slavers hands then promptly proceeded to claim his prize. 

It was a young girl who looked no older than twelve summers. She look as frail as she was frightened. Her big green eyes seemed in direct contrast to her tanned skin and dark hair. Like many other women of Ekra she was both striking and lovely to behold. She gasped in pain as she was roughly grabbed on the upper arm by the portly gentleman. 

""My friend you have exquisite taste"" said the slaver. ""This lovely desert pearl still has her flower. She has yet to bleed but for you she will bleed soon"" a smug grin spread across his sun weathered face. 

""She's quite the desert pearl isn't she. Truly the jewel of my harem"" proudly proclaimed the gentleman. His huge belly shook with every deep gaffaw. The fear on the young girls face intensified but she dared not show it, though nothing could hide the tears welling in her eyes.

""You've got quite the harem my friend. So this is your tenth bride?"" enquired the slaver. 

""Twelfth, I bought a couple of brides from the night auction in the potters district last month. They were nothing but a pestilence. They knew nothing of cooking or cleaning, though they were very good at the art of pleasure."" said the portly gentleman, beaming under his thick and bushy beard.

""No surprises there my friend"" replied the slaver. ""Those brides you got from the night auction were probably former whores who couldn't pay off their debt.""

""No wonder they were so cheap"" said the portly gentleman. ""You will be sure to see me here again"".

""I'm glad my friend, enjoy your new wife.""

""I will, may the good gods smile on you.""

""And you as well my friend."" replied the slaver, looking genuinely satisfied with the transaction.

The portly gentleman strode off the auction stage, dragging his ""bride"" alongside him. The young girl turned around and looked behind her desperately. For a brief moment her eyes met mine, like they were begging me to save her. Her owner quickly disappeared into the crowd with her, blending in almost seamlessly with the locals.

This was everyday life in Kaba. For a resident of the more enlightened city of Mijya it was a difficult thing to see everyday. 

Due to international influence and pressure the sultan of Mijya abolished slavery. It was a happy day for the modest and vulnerable of the city, not so for the former slavers and their business owner clientele. The merchant rebellion of Mijya was a dark and bloody time. The streets ran with rivers of blood for half a year. Thankfully the sultans army quashed the rebellion though it served as a reminder that peace, as well as freedom, was fragile and easily lost.

I was but a humble trader, on a business trip to this wonderous and ancient yet backwards city of Kaba. My job was to accompany my boss while we brokered a trade agreement between his trade company and some textiles company here in this city. They specialised in ruby silk, a very rare and expensive commodity. 

Little did we know that the deal was a scam and that later that night I will be fighting for my life.

*3rd Era, Year 47, Month 4, Day 18*

Klurn poured over maps, financial ledgers, militia reports, and legal documents in the cold stone room. He quickly darted from one dry piece of paper to another, lit only by an oil lamp silently flickering on the table, its glow barely reaching the bookshelves that lined the walls of the room. He was in no rush, yet he wasted no time, searching out each piece of information and then setting it back down in its place, trying to piece together the best way to proceed.

Klurn had spent many nights here, perhaps more even than in his own bedroom. But this was what he lived for. Sure, the wealth, power, and glory were all of the things he had worked hard to acquire, but his true joy came from the satisfaction of discovering a weakness to exploit, an opportunity to seize. And those were things he found here, in this dark and musty room full of books, not on the battlefield or in the palace halls.

It was here that he worked out the Usha treasury's complex investments and found a way to engineer a minor banking crisis that could be blamed on the Treasury Secretary. Klurn was shocked at how a man in charge of a nation's entire wealth could be so lacking in ambition, running the nation's finances as if it were a creaky old machine instead of a living thing. No one would mourn his beheading, especially not after Klurn took control of the treasury and manipulated the market to ensure that the nation quickly became a financial powerhouse, its previously modest mining industry now second only to Oroan far to the North.

It was here that Klurn had carefully designed a plan to manipulate racial tensions and engineer a national fear of raids from the South, despite the fact that the mostly tribal people of Ekra were fairly peaceful and mostly kept to themselves. This fear would be harnessed to forge Haban's military into a force to be reckoned with, yet without arousing the suspicion of The Ristan States, who would undoubtedly fund the formation of other armed forces in anticipation of hostilities if Haban seemed to be preparing an attack.

It was here that Klurn discovered the records of the former Regent's Ekran housekeeper, which were used to shame him into resigning. There were no laws against this sort of thing when she had worked for the man, but this hardly mattered when Klurn had stoked the people's outrage over the Regent's alleged Ekran sympathies.

Klurn was now in control of the Haban treasury and military, and while he could never be king, the king was young and, largely due to the ministrations of doctors in Klurn's pocket, bedridden, and as a result Klurn was essentially de facto ruler of Haban. But ruling Haban was never the endpoint for Klurn's ambitions.

Nor, for that matter, was war with Ekra. The desert nation was a massive wasteland of sandstorms and nomadic scavengers, a logistics nightmare to control and virtually possible to defend even if anyone did have a reason to conquer the accursed place. No, talk of tensions with Ekra was merely a means to an end, and that end was Vanos, to the East.

The city-state of Vanos was a lynchpin to the trade routes of the entire Eastern seaboard. While the nation itself was relatively small and unassuming, it was an absolutely vital trading post between Ekra, which brought spices and silks to the North, and the cities of Simoriah, which brought fish, livestock, and manufactured goods to the South. Controlling Vanos would give Haban a foot in the door to control over the entire continent.

However, between Haban and Vanos stood Makis and its capital city of Makiso, a strong walled city nestled atop rocky cliffs overlooking a vast steppe. The city could not be easily assaulted, and the Makis' legendary cavalry would quickly overtake and demolish any forces looking to make the long trip around the Makiso Plateau.

What's more, the Makis people were annoyingly quarrelsome. They rarely ventured far out of their homelands to cause trouble, but their culture outright forbade agreeing to anything resembling a non-aggression pact. And their internal politics were just as volatile. Any hopes of assassinating their leader and installing a puppet government were dashed from the outset because the Makis didn't even unanimously recognize *one* leader. When Klurn had first inquired with the Haban about the Makis, he was repeatedly told that it was better to simply kill them when they trespassed on Haban land and otherwise leave them alone to fight among each other.

Klurn sighed. Makis was an obstacle that needed to be overcome, but they couldn't be circumvented, couldn't be conquered by force, nor persuaded by diplomacy, or manipulated with politics. This problem would require a different sort of solution. Klurn pulled up a blueprint of schematics for Makiso retrieved by one of his spies, hoping to find a structural weakness. No luck, the walls of the place were massively thick and made almost exclusively of stone, making them both sturdy and resistant to fire.

Klurn grabbed another paper on foreign relations. It was depressingly short. In essence, Makis *had* no formal contact with its neighboring countries. It welcomed trade and respected trade envoys from anyone who cared to try dealing with them, but beyond that Makis largely ignored its neighbors, and neighboring countries ignored Makis.

He rifled through other papers. Geographical surveys, maps of game trails, rainfall records, horse breeding genealogical charts… Klurn paused for a moment and brought back the paper of rainfall records. It spelled out in intricate detail what Klurn already knew the short version of:  Makis had been suffering a moderate drought, and was about to enter its dry season. All told, this was expected to be an uncomfortably dry year throughout the region. However, this would have an effect. It could be a weakness. And the weakness of others was Klurn’s passion.

Klurn looked at other papers. Maps of rivers, rainfall forecasts, public well customs, accounts of water stores… then something caught his eye in the paper about well customs.

“… it is considered an insult by the Makis to waste water, the most precious of all resources in their eyes. Those who draw water from a well to sate theirs and their horses’ thirst, and to fill their water-bags, are expected to return to the well any water they do not use. Foreigners have been executed in Makis without trial or ceremony for simply upending a half-full bucket over their own head to cool off…”

Klurn took a moment to absorb this and then looked again at maps of city schematics, the river maps, and accounts of water stores. A plan had taken shape.

“Soruug,” he spoke aloud to the seemingly empty room, and not a moment later one of the shadows separated from the wall to join him at his side.

“I am here, sir,” the shadow spoke.

“Notify your network,” Klurn instructed, “tell them they are to enter Makis separately, anonymously, as foreign guests. They are all to arrive at different times so as not to arouse suspicion, but when they act, they must do it all at once. They are to systematically poison the wells of Makis.”

“Which wells shall we target, sir?” the shadow asked without hesitation.

“All of them,” Klurn responded.

“It shall be done within the week, sir,” the shadow declared, and then faded back into the darkness at the edge of the room.

Klurn didn’t like resorting to genocide. It was pointless to rule a nation if there were no people there to rule over. But the Makis defied rule, or in fact any kind of sensible order at all. And more importantly, they were an obstacle in his path. In all likelihood, some of the Makis would survive the poisoning using the nation’s water stores, and eventually they would rebuild and carry on as normal, although in smaller numbers that would be easier to manage. They might not even realize it is a poisoning, instead thinking it an illness. With any luck, he might just bring order to Makis once and for all. But if not, by the time they did recover he will have already taken Vanos, and would then be ideally placed to bring the Makis to hell once and for all.

Makis, then Vanos, then Distenia.

**Notes**: Okay, so I have no idea if I portrayed any of these nations in the way you envision them, and it bears mention that this may well be flavored by the story's villain protagonist and his own personal worldview. However, it seemed like it wouldn't be unreasonable to suggest that Ekra, being a large, sparse desert nation, would be considered more trouble than it was worth to conquer. Likewise, it seemed likely that Vanos would be of immense importance for trade between Ekra and Northern countries, and an aspiring conqueror would find it a key target of importance.

""Karak Jah Hai!"" The crowd roared, beating their spears and swords against the ground. The priest washed his thumb in the wooden bowl he held in his left hand, then dipped it in a bluish substance.

""Two, for the Two Rivers that once ran where the Desert lies,"" he said, marking two thick blue stripes across Kalaa's forearms. 

""Muraa Thuraa Jah Hai!"" The crowd screamed again, beating their weapons more intensely. The priest washed his thumb in the wooden bowl again, then dipped it into a black substance. 

""Three, for the Three Great Mountains where the Gods reside,"" he said, marking three upwards facing arrows on Kalaa's chest.

""Harah Kir Ratha Jah Hai!"" The crowd bellowed, nearly breaking their weapons as they intensified their beating. The priest washed his thumb once more, then dipped it into a dark red substance.

""Four,"" he said, looking the young man straight in the eyes this time, ""for the Four Kings slain to unite Ekra into one, glorious nation! Honor be with them, for they fought bravely!"" The crowd roared and broke their weapons against the ground. The priest raised his hand and they quieted down. He marked one red line across Kalaa's right temple. ""Korath, who ruled over Mijya,"" he said.

""Korath Jah Hai!"" the crowd roared. The priest marked another red line across his right cheek. 

""Ruruk, who presided over Shaalt.""

""I know present to you your new Emperor, Kalaa!"" The priest said, facing Kalaa and placing an elaborate golden crown upon his head.

""Kalaa Jah Hai! Kalaa Jah Hai! Kalaa Jah Hai!"" Kalaa raised his hands and the crowd's chants dissipated into scattered cheering, before eventually stopping completely.  

""The Great Scorching has crippled the once-mighty empire of Ekra. We are now a shadow of our former selves,"" he said. The crowd murmured. ""We now have less than half the land we had at the height of our nation. We have been too peaceful and kind to our enemies. And as a further insult, the pathetic country of Haban has captured the ancestral and sacred city of Usha."" The crowd started shouting in anger, cursing and making empty threats to the people of Haban. Kalaa raised his hands, and the crowd was silent. 

""As your Great Emperor, "" Kalaa said with a flourish, ""I shall restore Ekra to its former glory!"" The crowd was silent. They had heard promises like this before. Promises that had never been coupled with action. ""And I shall begin,"" he added, smiling shrewdly, ""by sieging the Kingdom of Usha!"" The crowd cheered wildly, to the point where Kalaa could not hear himself think. One person climbed atop a rock and began chanting.

""Kalaa Jah Hai! Kalaa Jah Hai! Kalaa Jah Hai!"" Soon the entire crowd joined in. Kalaa raised his hands, and the crowd quieted down.

""To arms!"" He yelled, and the crowd began cheering as they ran home to gather armaments. *The rest of the world believes that we have lost our skill for battle,* Kalaa thought, *that years of reconstruction have made us peace-loving weaklings. But they are wrong. Ekra shall rule once more, and I shall not stop until the King of Distenia's head is at my feet.*  

&gt;

*The siege of Usha had been going on for 26 days. Lok, the Half-King of Haban had received no written warning. Kalaa, the new King of Ekra, simply appeared at the White Walls of Usha with an army of 75,000 soldiers. Lok had believed that the people of Ekra were weak. He ordered his standing army of 40,000 men to attack almost immediately. They surrendered within eight minutes. On the 27th day, Lok received a message. It said that if Lok was able to defeat Kalaa in a Taa, or duel, he would end the siege. Lok, believing himself to be a great warrior, eagerly accepted.*  

&gt;

""These are the hands that slew the previous king of Usha,"" Lok bragged, raising his fists. Kala said nothing. Lok scrutinized him. 

""Stances!"" The Taa Ri said. Lok and Kalaa snapped into stance. Lok assumed the Bharya stance, while Kalaa assumed the Vilsya stance. 

""Vilsya,"" Lok marveled, ""I haven't seen that since Ekra controlled Vemnas."" Kalaa glared at him. 

""Begin!"" The Taa Ri shouted, taking a step back. Lok immediately lunged forward, more strength than skill, jabbing at Kalaa's head. Kalaa swung his head back just enough for Lok to miss. Lok stepped forward and punched, aiming for the stomach. Kalaa easily sidestepped it and backed away, sizing up Lok. Lok grinned. 

""Typical of Vilsyis,"" he said, ""searching so hard for opportunity that they miss it when it's right in front of them."" Kalaa showed no signs of emotion. Lok turned and blasted a kick in Kalaa's direction. Kalaa sidestepped the kick and grabbed Lok's leg. Before he could react, Kalaa raised his elbow and smashed it into Lok's kneecap. He howled in pain, swinging his leg wildly and praying it would hit something. Kalaa let go and backed away. He started slowly circling Lok. Lok glared at him. He limped forward. Kalaa stopped, perking his ears. In one fluid motion, Lok jumped forward, twisted his body, and kicked at Kalaa with all of his strength. Kalaa jumped as high as humanly possible, going above Lok's legs, and landed on top of his chest with a powerful kick. Lok screamed in pain. Kalaa held out his hands and the Taa Ri handed him a ceremonial knife. He raised the knife over his enemy's head. Lok closed his eyes. Kalaa brought the knife down on Lok's throat with all of his strength. Lok sputtered and gasped, and then was gone. All was silent. Suddenly, from his army, he heard a chant. 

""Kalaa Tarh Sa! Kalaa Tarh Sa! Kalaa Tarh Sa!"" He smiled. Long live the king.",ExtemePaintDrying

Well it depends on who you ask for the other races. Followers(also calls True Virists) would tell you other races angered Vir and were turned into sand and water. 

Traditionalists would say that we killed the Draseeri( sort of like elves) and that the Drath(stone creatures kinda like dwarves) all died our long before that. Allegedly all magicks come from the lost Draseeri and because all of the Draseeri are dead, magick has been getting weaker and weaker for thousands of years.

Ekrans would deny anything but Draminn(humans) ever existed.

*3rd Era, Year 21, Month 2, Day 17*

""We've got a large wave incoming from the starboard side, Cap'n!"" Alexi yelled over the rain, their ship crashed violently into the sea and many of the sailors spilled over the deck. ""She's not going to take much more of this!""

Captain Hemdik laughed, ""She can hold!"" He patted the ship's wheel, ""She's sailed all around this land, she'll make it!""

Alexi stumbled up the steps to the Captain's side, he looked out over the ship. They had been traveling for a few weeks now, but this journey was to be the longest, and hopefully, the most plentiful. ""Cap,"" he said, ""we should steer clear of the storm, head South and then turn back into the island.""

""No can do!"" He moved the wheel in one full motion, swinging the ship to the port side. ""The wave will hit us from behind,"" he smiled and pointed forward, sticking his hand between the wheel, ""give us a nice kick!""

Alexi smiled, he always enjoyed the Cap's gentle sarcasm, they both knew that the incoming wave was going to do more than *kick* them. Alexi looked over the ship, the sailors that had signed up for the job were scurrying across the deck. He did kind of admire it all, elves working with humans, humans working with orcs, and all of them following a dwarf Captain. ""You don't see this too often,"" he whispered aloud.

""Oi? Are you going on about the crew again?""

Alexi nodded as he watched a human throw a rope up to an elf who was climbing the forward mast. In most cases, this would never happen. ""Yes, Cap! Sorry, Cap!""

Hemdik laughed again as he peered behind him. He could see the wave was close and he knew what was about to happen. ""Do you sorry whelps want to die in the Great Waters?""

The sailors all screamed back, ""No, Cap!""

""Do you want to make it to Asn Alaso?""

""Yes, Cap!""

""Then brace your asses!"" Hemdik grabbed the wheel, while Alexi grabbed hold of the railings, ""Mother Goddess is hitting us hard today!""

*The Grovelands; City of Springmoore*    
*3rd Era, Year 21, Month 1, Day 3*

Alexi sat at the tavern after a long day of working the boats. His fishing group had taken in a large haul today, but at this rate, it wasn't enough for his weekly quote. If they wanted to make ends meet, they needed a big haul tomorrow, or even better, the next few days. Unfortunately, Alexi knew, the fish just weren't biting this year.

He sipped quietly on his ale as the other fisherman spoke about how they wanted to leave the Grovelands, head west to the farmlands and work the land like their ancestors. He knew none of them would leave, not with the war going on in the Southern Kingdoms. Unfortunately for all them, the Grovelands were one of the safest places you could meet.

His attention drifted when the tavern quieted down due to the door opening. He didn't see who it was at first, but it became clear that there was a dwarf standing in the doorway.

""Oh, please,"" the dwarf said, ""don't get up for me.""

The tavern owner walked to the edge of the bar, past Alexi and a few of his fishermen, ""What do you want *dwarf*?""

The dwarf walked forward, pulled out a large sack of coin and placed it on the counter, ""I'd like to buy the house a round.""

The owner, a not-so pleasant gentleman by the name of Vani grabbed the purse of coin and shook it. He looked at the dwarf up and down, ""The dwarf wants to buy the house drinks, what do you say boys?""

There were a few murmurs and whispers, but a resounding ""Aye"" came from everyone, except Alexi.

""What do we call you?""

""Name's Hemdik, traveler, drinker, sailor.""

""Welcome to Springmoore Hemdik.""

Hemdik nodded and walked past a few patrons. Alexi gave the dwarf that much, he knew how to buy humans silence. Ever since Distenia had taken over Disten-Val from the Dwarves, there weren't many free ones left. Mostly slaves. Excellent sailors though, Alexi remembered that.

""This seat taken?""

Alexi realized Hemdik was asking him, he grunted and shook his head. Hemdik sat up on the chair with ease, even with his short and bulky frame. Alexi just kept drinking his own ale, as a fresh one was brought out for Hemdik.

""Can you tell me anything about Springmoore?"" He said.

The owner shrugged, ""Not much to tell. The big city is a few miles South from here, you're mostly in the fishing village.""

""That right?"" He took a sip, ""Good sailors around these parts?""

The owner glanced at Alexi, who dropped his ale, ""What's it to you?""

Hemdik smiled at Alexi's entrance into the conversation, ""I want to put together a crew, got a few elves willing to join.""

Alexi shook his head and picked up his ale again, ""Ain't no human going to work with an elf, let alone follow a dwarf.""

He leaned forward on the counter, a few other patrons listening in on the conversation, ""Oi, I've heard that. But the elves changed their mind, and I can be *very* charismatic.""

Alexi looked over to the dwarf, eyeing him up and down, he raised an eyebrow, ""What's your deal?""

""I know how to get to Asn Alaso.""

An eerie silence came over the tavern, cups of ale hit the tables and a few people even tripped on their own feet. Asn Alaso was a dream of every pirate, sailor, and treasure hunter in the world. The famous birthplace of every single race, long abandoned.

""I've heard it all before,"" Alexi drank his ale and stood upwards, ""Everyone thinks they can make it through the Great Waters, you can't."" Alexi placed two gold coins on the counter before turning away.

""With the right crew and the right ship I can.""

Alexi sighed, ""And you have those?""

Hemdik shrugged, ""One of the two.""

He turned around, ""Oh?""

""The *Glistening Diamond*, you ever hear of it?""

""Aye, I have. Fastest and strongest ship made by the dwarves. To my knowledge, it was destroyed long ago.""

Hemdik laughed loudly, ""Oh Matrons no!"" He threw himself off the seat and smile, ""She's still around, sitting just outside the port.""

""Who's her Captain?""

He smiled, ""I am.""

"[IP] This map represents years of work, please just go absolutely mad.",Cjelliott13,"It had been months since The Grovelands began to burn. My home, and everyone I had ever loved burned to ash. In the Grovelands, it was considered cowardly  to retreat in the face of fear, despite the otherwise passive nature of our people. But that is what I did. I walked away, and the Undying Flame consumed my whole world behind my back. The stink of charred flesh would eventually wash out of my clothes, but I wonder if it could ever my washed away from my mind.

The Undying Flame was the result of a collaboration between high hopes and impatience on the part of the Order of the Sanguine Steel, the cult that lived in fear of what they believed lay in wait in the Frozen Beyond. Despite the fact that almost certainly nothing could survive in the condition of that land beyond the mountains, the Order persisted in their quest, plunging their crimson blades into anyone that argued otherwise.

After enough time and enough death, the Order happened upon a tome that detailed a powerful and ancient magic; an undying fire that would purify all evil from the world. It would burn away the thick ice of the Beyond, and turn whatever creatures were supposedly there into dust. Their remains would fertilize the newly exposed soil beneath, and create a new, hospitable land which we could colonize. This is what they believed.

Something went wrong. No one from the north is alive to tell the tale of what exactly went awry, but the flame did not travel north to the Beyond. It began traveling south, and in due time, it will burn us all, or drive us into the Great Waters. Only time will tell.

Now I am just a watcher. I too travel south, only steps ahead of the flame. I am witness to the final moments of humanity. Some huddle with their families close, praying in between uncontrollable sobs. Some revert back into something old and primal, and use their final time in this world to savagely and selfishly take whatever they want, from whoever they want.

Some believe that I am an omen, that I am Death himself, shepherding the flames across our great continent. They see me in my tattered robes, dyed black by the ashes of a thousand lives, and they try to plead with me, to barter with me. I keep my eyes focused on the road ahead, and I continue walking.

I will eventually reach the Waters. Everyone will be dead, and I will be the last man. I will submerge myself in the waters, and wash myself of humanity. I will let the water flow into me, and try to wash away the stench of death from within me. And once I am clean and pure again, I will let myself sink into the depths, to a place where no fire can ever reach me.  ",Chrytical
"[IP] This map represents years of work, please just go absolutely mad.",Cjelliott13,"Part 2

The King of Arnel whose capitol was in Trem wanted no part in angering the Distenian Empire and had forbid Govenor Gregory of Seist from sending troops to help Xill. Xill, however, had promised the governor of Seist a place in the kingdom of Xill and so he defected. After angering Distenia the cities of Orast, Bremwater, and Divmore who bordered the Distenians had expressed a desire to dissent and join the empire so that their cities would not be destroyed. Distenia being occoupied with trying to conquer the city of Pitch decided it would accept the govenors of the 3 cities in Esi if they would commit to helping Renmar resist Xill and Seist. All the while Arnel was trying to put its kingdom back together. It was a complicated mess that normally Aranir and all of the Culvenians would have taken no part in. 
As Malik and Basilk walked in they took their seats at the table with the other governors waiting for Lord Simon of Aranir to speak first. Simon was just staring silently into the sea. Basilik noted the absence of a few governors from a few northern counties. Finally Lord Simon turned and addressed his governors, “Some of you may have noticed the absence of a few of our northern governors. I do not know for sure where they are, but I believe my greatest fears are coming true. A little less than a year ago King  Aaron of Arnel requested that we join him in his fight to hold his kingdom together. He needed more men, horses, and food as his kingdom was split in 3. I refused this of course. It is not our way to get in other kingdom’s affairs. Then 2 months ago I received threats toward Aranir and our counties if we did not give in. My assumption was that King Aaron was bluffing. He was too busy with his own dissenting lords to follow up on a threat. Yet I did not want to respond without first talking to my own governors. Our annual festival was near and so my decision was to wait until this meeting to consult all of you. I never guessed Aaron would make a move and certainly not before our meeting. Yet there are notable absences from our northern governors. I fear Aaron has already sent men south. The mountains and sea have always protected us from the East, West, and South. We have never needed to fear war from the long stable and friendly kingdom of Arnel to the North, but I fear we may finally be brought to war.” The governors sat in silence. Nobody knew what to say. The young Governor Jupis spoke first, “Then we must sharpen our swords! We must put on our armor! Call our men! We must defend our land! Defend our people! Let us call Gran and Culvera to our cause!” The old and bearded Governor Roland from a southern county slowly forced himself to stand up and said, “In my 50 years of ruling I have always seen peace. This is folly. We cannot stand up against the professionally trained standing armies of Arnel! I will not see my county burnt to the ground! If you would declare war I will pledge my county’s loyalty to Gran. My land is closer to them anyhow.” Lord Simon responded, “Kind Governor Roland, I would not declare war, because I fear it is always upon us! I will forgive your traitorous talk because you are an old man and have always been good to Aranir. Surely you did not mean it. Speak of that again and I will make sure what little years you have left are spent here, as a prisoner and I shall see if your son is less cowardly. He has waited long enough to rule as it is.” Another Governor stood up and suggested that Aranir seek aid from Distenia, “siding with them will scare off Arnel!” Basilik stood up and responded, “Are you mad!? Would you throw away our sovereignty!? They are too far to help as it is. We should seek an alliance with Hen. They are no doubt not far from being wrapped up in the war as well.” By this point every governor was up and yelling for his opinion. Lord Simon stood there looking lost and defeated. The window however had been distracting Malik.  The sea always mesmorized him. Something on the horizon had taken his attention. Malik got up and walked around the table toward the window. Those were ships on the horizon. Lots of them. Malik turned around to see his father noticing the same thing. Basilik slowly walked toward the window as well. “Those are purple banners” Basilik declared. As the governors continued to bicker in the background, Basilik, Malik, and now Lord Simon watched while frozen. Something finally broke Basilik from his trance and he turned around and yelled with such ferocity that it silenced everyone else in the room, “The purple banners of Arnel are on the horizon. They have come! Ready what men you have! Close the gates! They are upon us!” What followed was pure chaos. Men were running in every direction shouting orders this way and that. Arnel had come to Aranir while it had every governor gathered in one place. Basilik was running with his son Malik down the steps toward the East Gate where they had come in. “Father, why are we running toward the gate, would we not be safer further in the city?” Malik questioned. Basilik put both hands on his son’s shoulders and said, “Son, this is the day you must become a man. We may hold for a short time, but it will not last. Arnel will take all of our horses. They will force all our men of the right age to fight in their ranks.  Most of our food will be taken. The heirs such as yourself will be taken hostage that might ensure our obedience. You must run.” “but father…” Malik objected. Basilik would not let him finish. “You must listen to me! Go east! You will find friends in Simoriah where your mother was born! Take your horse Susa. First go back to Obsula to warn the town of what is coming. You must speak to Willem who is the head of my counsel. Tell him everything you have heard today. He shall aid you. Tell your mother I love her. She will tell you who you must find in Simoriah. Malik, you must find help while in Simoriah. You must learn how to lead men into battle. Although you shall be gone, it is still your responsibility to protect Obsula and all of Culven.” Everything was such a blur for Malik. It seemed as if one moment he was listening to a lecture from his father and the next he was riding his horse, Susa, as fast as he could southeast of the city. It wasn’t until he was in the hills, hidden from sight of Aranir that he let his horse rest. Malik could still hear chaos behind him. While Susa drank from a stream Malik sat and wept. He had not realized that he might never see his father again. He had left still in shock without saying a word. Malik wanted to turn back to tell his father he loved him. That he would make him proud. That he wanted to fight beside him now, but he knew that would be impossible. Only now was Malik finally starting to process all that had happened. Everything in his life had changed. Before this day his plan had been to grow up learning from his father how to lead. To marry the red headed beauty, Sophia whom he had always fancied. Being the heir to Obsula, his life had been planned since before his birth. Yet now everything was in the dark. Malik didn’t even know how he could get to Simoriah. It was on the other side of the continent. The Culivenian Mountains to the East were near impossible to cross. Normally anyone wishing to go east would have gone north of Aranir before turning east where the mountains grew much smaller, but there was so much war to the north where Arnel was invading. Malik could not risk getting captured or killed. He could pass them to the south, passed Culvera, but that would mean he would need to venture through The Burnt Sea. It was a near unlivable dessert. Few knew the locations Oasis’ that made it passable. Even if Malik did find a way to cross the mountains there was miles and miles of wilderness in Borfien waiting for him on the other side. He had no clue how he would do it. Malik just focused on his immediate goal, to return to Obsula for a short time. He would find a way to Simoriah when the time came. No matter which way he chose, Malik knew it would be an adventure. He had always loved stories of adventure, but now that it was upon him. Now that he couldn’t flip the page to see how it ended. Now that the adventure was real and he wasn’t sitting safely at home. Now the adventure didn’t seem so appealing. Yet he knew it is what he must do.",Lone_Star_122

The University in Poven being the center for the study of Magick aswell as everything else in the world. With enough practice anyone can learn magick, albeit what they can actually do with magick will likely be little. The Grand Lord-Mage of the University, Mage Raviom Seplesse, is said to be the most powerful mage since the beginning of the Azurian Calendar and has been able to pull off some amazing magickal feats, including creating a large fireball from nothing(which hasn't been done in hundreds of years). However it is said that the average Draseeri was much more powerful than Mage Seplesse is.

Draminn are the only living race other than the obvious things like livestock and such. However the look of a Kalrukan and a Distenian is very different, different facial features and skin and such lead to this.

One of the stories i've mulled around with this world is a lone Draseeri returning to the world.

The current year is 1374 AC(Azurian Calendar), and its courtship season.

The Distenian Empire has recently ended a long series of wars known collectively as the Distenian Advance by losing the [battles of the Areisi River and the Battle of Tristor](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/3uomsz/what_are_some_of_your_worlds_famous_battles/cxgxkm2).

The current Emperor of Distenia, Mikael Ront III, is very sick and his son, Crown Prince Alecksander Ront, is poised to take the throne. 

Distenia remains at war with Hen and the Boesan Republics over land disputes.

The Azurian Prince has died in a tragic accident, the details of which are not very clear.

The Areisi Dominion, the unified front of Arnei, Esi, and Seist, is falling apart as the three constituents bicker and in-fight.

The current Tide King, Arvald Buulk, in Kalruka is getting very old and an election will likely be held soon to decide who will be the  new Tide King.

For the first time in over 600 Ekran Years, an Ekran Sultan, Baru Khel'brites, has announced he will permit foreign nobles and royals to court the Sultana(his daughter).

Vanos and Vemnas are still at war, because of course they are.

Gian and Kalruka have declared Asn Alaso an unclaimed land and are currently making agreements over who will get to colonize the foreign isle. Any sailors brave or foolish enough to try to run the Great Waters to bring Asni Savages to Simorian slave markets face execution by the Giani and Kalrukan navies if caught, or immense fortune if succesful.

The prince of Koyn has died competing in a tournament in Sicrue and the two countries are at war, but fighting has died down.

Daith has rebelled against the Lordlands of Giine. The so-called Defender of Daith has been leading a volunteer army defending the elected leaders of the new fledgling state.

A drought in Culven has sent grain prices through the roof across the southern continent.

"[WP] Just include the sentence: ""No one dared move.""",Evitherator,"The spread was humongous. A true cornucopia of goodness to celebrate the company's most successful year yet. There was a sushi buffet with every roll imaginable, sashimi, and different squid dishes. There was a burrito bar with guacamole', chicken and steak, and several kinds of shredded cheese. There was Indian food, Korean food, burgers, hot dogs, and my personal favorite - an open bar. We knew this year had been successful, but we didn't realize that the boss appreciated it quite this much.

&amp;nbsp;

The year had been rough, but rewarding. The entire company had worked long hours and very closely together over the past eleven months to secure several new contracts that allowed for expansions, raises, and better benefits overall. We knew that once things settled down that all of the time at the office, away from our spouses and kids, would be worth it.

I had missed countless dinners myself, a few baseball games, and hadn't seen my friends but a few times in the past six months. All of that time away was paying off in a big way though. I had several new employees, a shiny new title with more money to boot, and a corner office with a view. The hard part was over and now it was time to enjoy the spoils of victory.

&amp;nbsp;

""Ahem, is this thing on?"" a voice boomed over the microphone as a large amount of reverb swept through the room.

Mr. Donaldson, the head of the company spoke, ""It's so good to see you all hear. I hope you have all enjoyed yourselves tonight...""

The room broke into cheers.

Mr. Donaldson continued ""Yes, I hope you all have had your fill! It's been a great year.""

More cheers filled the room.

""But I have decided to close the company. I'm moving with my new wife to Costa Rica. I've sold off our contracts and assets and you're all being let go.""

There was absolute silence. No one could believe that this was happening. Mr. Donaldson had been known to joke in the past and he definitely had his sensitivity issues.

A senior vice president in the front row guffawed, ""Good one Donaldson! And I'm sure we all have to pay for our own meals tonight too!""

Mr. Donaldson did not laugh. He stared at the senior vice president for a moment before saying ""Well, first thing first... I absolutely despise you Jerry. Absolutely, completely, totally.""

Jerry's smile faded.

""And as far as the food is concerned, it's free, but I spiked it with laxitives, because  much in the same way that I hate Jerry with a deep passion, I hate all of you. So I really hope you've had your fill, because it should be hitting about now.""

As the two leered at each other,the pale fluorescent lights began to switch off one by one until there was nothing but pitch-black darkness.The gang leader and his cronies were obviously taken aback as evident from the sudden nervous chatters that filled the closed lot.The man paced around uneasily,as if contemplating the reason behind the unexpected blackout.He then faced one of his men,whom he called Mikhail,and presumably ordered him in incomprehensible Russian.The goon walked off to do whatever it was that he was instructed to do while the others went to the taxis to switch on the front lights which hardly illuminated the surrounding gloom.



From within the shadows,right where Mikhail went,something clattered; followed by a loud pained howl.Uneasiness was spreading,and the goons found themselves looking at each other anxiously.No one dared move.



The gang leader called to his missing man with a shaky voice in hopes of getting a response,to no avail.He called again,but this time to undermine a creeping thought on his head,because he knew.



He knew that he had incurred The Devil's Wrath,and it was only a matter of time before he faced his punishment.



As if reading his thoughts,the woman cackled mockingly.She stared at the gang leader with a renewed sense of determination and jeered at him.



""You wanna know his name,"" She managed to taunt in between breaths.""Then ask him yourself.""

"[WP] Just include the sentence: ""No one dared move.""",Evitherator,"Just something I made real quick. Criticism appreciated!

Tick. Tick. Tick.

Mrs. Laughtner's 12th grade English class, last period of the day. 

The students waited their seats, but no one dared move. This was the last day of the school year, and everyone was waiting. They were going to rocket out that door the moment the bell rang, stampede any unfortunate 9th graders in the way, (a few students flinch) and leave this place forever. (Except Adrian, he had summer school, but that didn't count.)

So, the 12th graders sat, not daring to invoke their monster of a teacher's wrath.

"[WP] Just include the sentence: ""No one dared move.""",Evitherator,"""Ladies and gentlemen, your attention please.""
 
 
A well-dressed, affluent-looking gentleman said as he entered the dining car. The passengers of the Fallsworth grew silent. Heads turned, and a mixture of curiosity and slight annoyance hung in the air. Nothing but the loud, rhythmic drone of the wheels on the tracks can be heard. Satisfied that all eyes and ears are on him, the man spoke.
 
 
""I'm afraid that we will be experiencing some slight delays."" Panic gripped each person as the man produced a crudely-painted tommy gun.

""In fact,"" the man continued. ""Most of you may not be able to reach your intended destination.""
 
 
More men entered, all wielding similarly strange tommy guns. Shots were fired. A man, who grabbed a knife and shielded his wife and child, fell to the ground. Cries of fear filled the car. The man's wife stared, dumbfounded, at her husband, now bathing in a pool of his own blood, as one of the men wrestled her daughter from her arms.  The poor girl could do nothing but cry as they dragged her away.
 
 
""Now, now. Certainly, you all are upset by this... inconvenience,"" the man spoke over the cries, his tone unchanging.

""So I must ask for each of you to co-operate with me and my associates, to expedite our venture."" He smiled, his demeanor unnervingly warm and friendly.
 
 
No one dared move or speak. Parents huddled close to their children. Heads stayed down, avoiding contact with this... madman.
 
 
""I appreciate it.""
 
 
The men were strangely uninterested in gold or jewelry, instead, were more intent in taking children away. Thirty minutes and twelve dead bodies later, only the adults were left in the car, standing quietly, facing the windows. Suddenly, the train stopped. The children could be seen being marched out of the train, and were soon made to stand face-to-face with their parents.
 
 
""Everyone, we have arrived. But it is truly unfortunate to tell you that you may not leave this vehicle."" Confusion, despair, regret, fear. Not one passenger was not in tears.
 
 
""Allow me to extend my gratitude to each of you, for your support. It was truly a pleasure working with you."" The men filed up, aiming their guns at the terrified passengers.

Some moron has lived for over 250 years and they have no idea why.,GoodRighter,"“What’s your secret?” One after another, the representative from each affiliate news station repeated the question to Willie Jenkins. “Haven’t got one,” he replied, politely and in succession. Willie’s 250th birthday garnered a bit less national attention than his 150th and his 200th, as far as he could recall. The President himself had stopped by a hundred years ago to bestow a longevity medal and shake Willie’s hand on camera. Today, the questions had been perfunctory and stilted. In past years, Willie obstinately refused parades and festivals in his honor, insisting he spend his birthday by his key cutting machine where he feels most comfortable. This year, to Willie’s relief, there were no such demands to turn down. Old Man Jenkins is less a national hero today than a near-forgotten relic, and it suits him just fine.

The scientists had long since given up, and the media seemed to be following in kind. One reporter hung back while the others filed out of Willie’s key shop into their news vans. Willie noticed the exodus as much as he noticed the influx, his skilled eyes all the while trained on the bumps and valleys forming on a new brass door key.  “Mr. Jenkins,” the remaining reporter said as she approached the workbench, “may I ask you some additional questions?” Willie finished smoothing an edge and looked up. He had seen many humans over his extraordinarily long life, and this was not one of them. “Go ahead,” he said, his eyes calmly settling back on the key.

“I can tell that you are aware of certain oddities in my appearance, and I would be surprised at your disinterest if you weren’t already such an unusual case.” Willie continued cutting. “Mm-hmm.”

“Do you not wonder why you are still alive? So long after your contemporaries, and their children, and their children’s children have perished?” “T’ain’t my business. I cut keys.”

“Where are your thoughts, Mr. Jenkins? Your thoughts on life and existence? Have you not contemplated your place on Earth and in the Universe? It is only natural do to so.” “No ma’am, can’t stop concentrating while cutting keys. Could lose a finger.”

“And of things past? And of the specter of the future? The plight of the human race?” “Ma’am, I need to finish this key before closing time so that Mrs. Foster can pick it up in the morning. So if there’s nothing else…”

The reporter switched off the key cutter with a quick swipe of the hand. Willie was startled, but managed to secure the brass door key and avoid any errant cuts.

“Just tell me one thing, Mr. Jenkins: why are you here?” Willie stood up and came face to face with the reporter. His eyes made contact with her eye-level region. Without breaking his gaze, he stretched out his arm and switched the key cutter back on.

Some moron has lived for over 250 years and they have no idea why.,GoodRighter,"No one took any notice until she was 114. Some reporter tracked her down for a filler piece, and that's the first she heard about being the oldest living human on Earth.

""Ol' Sue Bradley... I'm allowed to call her 'Ol',' y'see, because that's how she identified herself... she died a couple months earlier, 118, bless her, and I was the oldest one left! Got my picture in th' paper and everything!""

She boasted to one of her progeny at yet another birthday party. The organization that used her genetic material for research compensated her lavishly, so every year each of her still-living offspring would gather at her estate to celebrate her life. None of her children were alive anymore, nor any of her grandchildren... though there may still be some great-grandchildren holding on. She'd stopped trying to keep track of all the deaths in her family. All it did was make her sad, and she didn't like to dwell on any thoughts unless they brought her happiness.

Having children gather around her was always welcome, even if she'd lost track of how they were related to her at this point. Some weren't even her own children, but the children of her many clones. Not too many of the clones were around these days, either. Whatever kept her alive had evidently been lost in the cloning process. ""The scientists keep trying, bless 'em. I tell them, though, there's only one of me! I just can't be replaced, you got that? The world needs a Norma Lutz. Not some petri dish imitation.""

Norma's clones invariably received the highest quality education, and the best possible care from the families that raised them. ""Ms. Lutz has been blessed with unprecedented longevity,"" Dr. Weston once said in a speech, ""However, her start in life was not so blessed. She was raised in an impoverished household, had to drop out of school as a young girl to start work, and often had hungry nights in her early years. We want to provide the individuals who emerge from this project the best possible start in life. It is the right thing to do, from an ethical standpoint, to treat these people whose lives we are creating as well as we know how to treat them. And our hope, the best possible outcome from this experiment, would be to provide the world with women who are not only long-lived, but who understand the world and their place in it. People who are able to put that understanding into action, and to help us all make this planet a better place for everyone.""

A noble goal, but it hadn't worked out as planned. The first time Norma heard news that one of her clones had perished, she wept. Now, though, she's heard the same news so many times, she only shakes her head sadly.

""The world needs a Norma Lutz,"" she'll say. After a moment, the sorrow will leave her expression, and she'll wink at whoever is nearby. ""And that's me.""",narrativedilettante

[WP] People only die if they realize or learn a certain specific truth about the universe. Outside forces patrol the minds of people and execute them once it is found. Some moron has lived for over 250 years and they have no idea why.,GoodRighter,"Most people were unsure if they had even grown over the past ten years. Deep caverns with shades of stress and strain, hatred and fear had scared the surface for well over a century and a half. The sunlight was now forbidden from entering these cracks, the high walls impenetrable keeping out all unwanted outsiders, light included. On the face this was apparent, although statues and other representations never reflected it, instead showing how it used to be. The stoic expressions from eons ago still remain, watching over us and keeping us safe, the anomaly of our time. 

We had never assumed it to be this way, at least for this long. It started as a joke, made by news networks and social media websites on the old computers and cell phones people communicated with. Now though the joke was far too real, far too fleshed out and horrific to ever be laughed at in any sense. The launch sites of Africa were deteriorating and the Mars colonies were thriving. Every major city in the states was near abandonment while Muslims and unattractive women attended to the launch procedures and attempted upkeep of our home planet.

 I returned to stock up on Muslim slaves to be used in sport combat, the act of going to war for fun, which had become quite popular with the emperor in recent years. We all loved sport combat. “It is tremendous” we’d say; although everyone I knew wondered why we had to watch Muslims murder one another. Some say we did this before the emperor took over. In places called Afghanistan, Syria, and Iraq (somewhere in the desolate stripped oil-bomb evac sites) these so-called heathens would attack one another and us too! The media would cover the stories almost exclusively and the whole world would watch in horror as entire nations of people attempted to destroy one another. Something we’d even get involved using old missiles and “drones”, although I never could quite figure out how those things stayed in the sky. 

Either way, the sport combat trip had to be completed and my ship had just touched down in Africa. Donam would be supplying my ship this time around. Donam was a portly gentleman, always fond of eating and drinking beer to somehow forget that he lived on earth still. Yet, his adorable family all loved him and showed it each day when he returned home. He loved them as well and was never afraid to show it. 

“Even’n” Donam muttered
“Ay” I retorted. We didn’t share much conversation. Simply there to do our jobs. He opened the large rear door to the transport vehicle; 24 muslims all chained and covered with a facetious political mask stood side by side in the dark. A deep pungent smell wafted out with the breeze, a mix of sweat and urine stuck in the air as I stared down this week’s crop. 
“They getting thinna” I mentioned
“Dey stavin themseves” Donam replied “Dey refuse ta ate.”
“Cause de emperor can’t make em fight den” It was a sad truth. Yet, a truth nonetheless. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The touchdown was smooth on mars. New Tycho’s landing pads were marvelous on account of the ancient seabed being so flat. Consistent, smooth, perfect in every way. I’d just concluded the shutdown procedures and was waiting for permission to exit the ship. A look out the window revealed the standard view from one of these ports: a massive gold statue in the distance reflecting dim light out over the sprawling red below. Outterrain jeeps motored by at the feet of this gold behemoth, they’re distance giving the appearance of small mice scampering at the feet of a successful slumlord. I first noticed the lacking wrinkles at this point in time. The high, German origin, cheek bones were refracting the down onto the emperor’s minions below. How did this light escape him in real life? Had the deep caverns that appeared when he was still president become permanent? Was he unaware of them? No one in the states or the United Nation of Mars had quite figured out why it was that he had managed to live so long. 

I had a theory though. Rumor has it that no one knew about his ability to live so long until he was nearly 75. Everyone thought his hair was fake, that he would die off like the rest of us. That wasn’t the case, at least in my eyes. I think he was merely a young man and that his maturity was reflective of the actual age. Either that or he was blissfully unaware of that one thing that unites us all. 

REMOVING CARGO

The Muslims fighters were wheeled out from the basement of the ship. Deep in my chest a twinge of guilt struck me. “Dear Lord, please show these men success in their endeavors. Let them see their families again so that they may love one another. Let these men return to earth and teach their kin what love is so that one day they don’t get an emperor who doesn’t understand love. So that they don’t get an Emperor Donald Trump.”",squadrillionaire

[EU] Hogwarts gets a new competent Defence Against the Dark Arts professor - John Constantine,Lorix_In_Oz,"Harry first saw the new Professor during the Feast that marked the beginning of the school year - it was hard to miss him. He was the only man in the entire Great Hall dressed in what he recognised as Muggle clothing. He had come in just a little while later than the rest of the staff, hung up his greatcoat in a corner and took his seat beside Professors Flitwick and Sprout. He looked utterly out of place in a white button-down shirt rolled up to his sleeves, wrinkled khaki trousers and a tattered black tie. 

When the food had been cleared away and the announcements read out, Professor Dumbledore finished by introducing the newest member of the staff.

'And I am delighted to introduce Professor John Constantine, who will be taking up the post of your Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher for this year.'

Constantine smiled slightly and raised one hand in a wave while perfunctory applause broke out. Harry spied the Slytherins whispering among themselves, and guessed that they were mocking Constantine's muggle clothing. Even the Ravenclaws and some of his fellow Gryffindors were giving him odd looks.

'Who is he?' asked Harry later in the Common Room. 'Do you know anything about him?'

'Never seen him before in my life.'

'No clue.'

'I know most of the wizarding families around, and I don't know who he is,"" said Neville. 'He must be a muggle-born. Did you see what he was wearing?'

'Muggle-born or not, he looked tough,' said Ron. 'I can't wait for class. He looks like he's been in a fight or two.'

'He didn't assign us any books at all,"" said Hermione, looking distraught.

'Even better,' said Dean, grinning. 'Maybe he'll teach us some practical fighting moves.' He mimed a karate chop at Seamus, which instigated a glorious impromptu wrestling match.

The next day, Harry and the rest of the Gryffindors filed into the same classroom where Professor Lupin had once defeated a boggart. Professor Constantine hadn't turned up yet. Harry took a seat near the front, as the rest of his friends chatted and laughed among themselves.

The door flew open with a bang, and Constantine strode in. He was wearing the same clothes he had on last night and came to a stop at the teacher's desk, leaning back against it. His rumpled blonde hair looked like it had broken a few combs in its time.

Ignoring the silent rows of Gryffindors in front of him, Constantine produced a cigarette and a lighter from his pockets. As Harry watched, amazed, he proceeded to light it and took a long drag.

'Don't mind if I smoke, do ye,' said Constantine. He spoke with a strong Liverpool accent, utterly different from McGonagall's Scottish burr or Dumbledore's distinguished tones. No one dared to contradict him.

'So. You're probably wondering who I am and what I'm about. My name, as Dumbledore saw fit to mention last night, is Constantine. I'm not a Professor, never stepped in a university in me life. Well, not unless you count the time with the Balliol College Demon. 'Sir' will do me. I tell you things, you listen to me, and if you pay attention, you just might live to a ripe old age.'

Constantine suddenly pointed to Ron. 'You there, got a name?'

'Weasley, sir. Ron Weasley.'

'Come on up here.'

Looking excited, Ron got up and stood in front of the class, a few feet away from Constantine.

'Alright lad. Imagine I'm an enemy and I've seen you. What do you do?'

Ron thought about it. 'I'd Disarm you?'

'Show me how it works,' said Constantine. 'Go on then.'

Ron looked around for encouragement. Seeing a few nods, he brandished his wand.

'Expelliarmus!'

Nothing happened. Constantine spread his arms wide.

'What happened, Weasley?'

'Um, you don't have a wand sir.'

'Boss, tha',' said Constantine, grinning widely. 'No, I don't have a bleedin' wand. It's a stick of wood. I could reach out and snap in half and then wha'?'

Ron had no answer. Constantine shook his head.

'Nevermind the wand. Hit me with a curse. Go on, give us yer best shot.'

'I don't know,' said Ron, looking doubtful.

'Do it,' snapped Constantine. Ron hesitated a moment longer, then aimed his wand square at the new teacher.

'Impedimenta!'

Ron got the word right, Harry knew, but still nothing happened. He looked around in confusion. Constantine reached over and snatched Ron's wand out of his grasp. Before anyone could do anything, he snapped it in half with his hands.

'My wand!' gasped Ron. Constantine offered it back to him. Ron grabbed at it, clutching the two wooden halves. But Harry couldn't see any trace of the unicorn hair that formed the core of his wand. Ron must have reached the same conclusion, because he looked up at Constantine and jabbed a finger at him.

'This isn't my wand!'

'Nah,' said Constantine. 'Never was. I nicked it out of yer luggage on the train last night and replaced it with that dud.'

Ron's mouth was hanging open in shock. Feeling suspicious, Harry withdrew his own wand and looked at it carefully. Now that he was really focused on it, he saw at once that this wasn't the wand Mr Ollivander sold him. It was another fake.

'Mister Potter over there's got the right idea,' remarked Constantine, as everyone in the classroom began checking their wands. Cries of disbelief and annoyance rose from the Gryffindors as they first glared at their wands and then at Constantine.

'Sir, where have you taken our wands?' asked Hermione, looking scandalised.

'Rule One,' said Constantine, ignoring her. 'Duelling's for idiots. Fighting's for idiots. No one's giving you points for style. If you want to really defend yourself against someone, do what I did. Fight dirty. Think, don't just memorise bleedin' spells out of a spellbook all the livelong day. Never start a fight unless you know you're going to win.'

'Sir, what if you're attacked? What if you don't have time to think of something?' asked Harry. Constantine gave him a searching look.

'Do you know what I'd have done if I had been yer ma, the day that bald bastard came into yer house?'

Harry's heart leapt at the mention of his mother. He shook his head.

'I'd have kicked him square in the balls. Betcha he wouldn't have expected that. And that's Rule Two. Always do what your enemy wouldn't expect you to do.'

Constantine finished his cigarette and ground it out on the desk.

'Right. Yer wands. I gave the whole lot to Peeves and let him do whatever the hell he liked. You have an hour and twenty minutes left. The students who come back here with their wand before the time is up gets to pass the class.'",FinnSolomon

""Perhaps, you would like to say a few words, Professor Constantine?"" Dumbledore asked, this time getting the mans attention.
 
Standing up from his chair, he looked annoyed as he stood in front of the young wizards before him. Taking a cigarette from his pocketed packet and lighting it, he surveyed the room while taking a deep drag of it. 

""Names John Constantine. I'm here to teach you lot about defending yourself against the dark arts, demons, and other nasty surprises that may jump out at ya while ya sleep."" He remarked, as Professor McGonagall waved the smoke coming from his cigarette away from her. 

""Good news is, as long as I'm here ya wont be having any problems."" He said rather cocky in his tone, before sitting back down in his seat. 

""Thank you Mr. Constantine."" Dumbledore said in bewilderment. 

""Ah ya welcome Chief."" He chuckled, as he leaned back in his chair. 

The students mumbled and whispered among themselves, the topic flowing from most of their mouths being the new poorly dressed Professor. He was dressed like a homeless muggle, but still carried a certain level of intimidation that came from a man who had faced more than his share of evil. 

Later that night, the newly crowned professor unpacked his belongings. This included a large bottle of whiskey, he would be enjoying soon enough. It wasnt like he was here to make friends among the ""elite"" magicians of the world, he was here for other reasons. He was after all, a con man among that of the wizardry world. A muggle born into this world, and adopted magic into his life. To have a wizard such as him, teaching in this school was certainly a point of controversy among the parents of his students he was certain. At the same time however, he didnt give a shit what they thought. There was something evil happening in Hogwarts this year, and he was there to make sure it didnt break loose. But for now, he was going to make sure this bottle would be empty by morning. 

The next day Harry, Ron and Hermoine all took their seats in class. The room echoed with the curious voices of the students, as they awaited their late new Professor. Fifteen minutes late, the doors flung open and the professor stepped into the room smelling of muggle cigarettes and sweat. 

""Good morning ladies and gents..."" He said flinging his trench coat across the desk. 

""Its afternoon sir."" Hermoine pointed out, causing the professor to check his watch.

""Thanks for reminding me."" John remarked, rubbing his temple hoping his hangover would subside. Chaz told him that bringing whiskey was a bad idea, but John wasnt coming to a school without bringing some booze. Especially a preppy place like here.

""Right. So, I'm guessing by now you all know your fair share of spells and defending magic?"" He asked, looking at his students. 

""Yes sir.""  Hermoine once again answered. 

""Are you the voice of the class or something?"" He asked, raising an eyebrow to the student before him. 

""She wishes"" A student from the back of the class answered, gaining a eruption of laughter from his fellow students. 

The same student was suddenly in shock as his quill rose from its inkwell and began poking and prodding him, before finally writing on his forehead the word ""Tosspot"". Everyone's now locked on the caster of the spell, Professor Constantine who was chanting and holding his arm forward towards the student. 
""No interrupting."" He said, smirking to himself. 

""With the exception of Mr. Potter, Ms. Granger, and Mr. Weasley none of you really have come face to face with evil before. At least no evil worth mentioning."" He began, lighting another cigarette to smoke. 

""So brought me in because I have seen shite that would make the evils they faced piss in their little boots. And that includes Voldermort."" The entire classroom gasped at the mention of he who must not be nameds name being spoken so casually.

""Any questions?"" He asked, parting the cigarette from his lips for a moment.
 
""Why are you dressed like a muggle?"" One student asked.

""Same reason I'm teaching here."" He responded. 

""Anyone else?"" John asked, receiving nothing but blank stares and shocked expressions. 

""First lesson. Sometimes ya gotta fight fire with fire, and when its not looking kick it in the bollox."" He started, turning from the students for a moment. 

And so began the lesson, as well as the semester of one of the most unorthodox Professors Hogwarts would ever see.

[EU] Hogwarts gets a new competent Defence Against the Dark Arts professor - John Constantine,Lorix_In_Oz,"Things changed during the tenure of the new Headmaster at Hogwarts. There wasn't much discussion, but the immediate placement of Headmaster Mcgonagall was followed by another professor, in the Defense Against the Dark Arts vacancy. Of course, there likely wasn't much emphasis on defending oneself against Dark Arts nowadays, ever since the defeat of Voldemort and the remaining Death Eaters nearly 16 years ago.

--

Remillia saw the new professor during the first Feast of the school year. She hadn't expected it, in fact no one had. The previous Dark Arts professor had served for three consecutive years - much to the chagrin of the school's ghosts would incessantly prattle about some kind of curse. This new one, however, seemed to break every single sort of convention there would have been for being a professor. For one, he kept smoking cigarettes throughout the Feast, as well as the introductions. And he was also dressed in appalling muggle clothing. But whatever, it wasn't much to think about right? This vacancy always draws out the weirdos and creeps.

--

""Everyone get out.""

She blinked and wondered if she had heard him right. Professor Constantine had just told everyone in his upperclassmen class to leave. On the first day?

""You all heard me."" He said in a monotone and almost bored candor. ""Leave, or I will fail all of you.""

There was a momentary pause followed by a cacophony of desks and chairs banging and shuffling robes as all the 5th years scrambled to get out. Constantine lit another cigarette and stood in the middle of the room and placed one hand in his trench coat while he observed the gaggle of students pushing and shoving through the doorway. As soon as they had all left, he flicked it out and stood facing them through the jamb. 

""Now this is how it will work. If you want to pass, you will fight me to get through. You can all work together or individually. You have 30 minutes to decide.""

He strode over and closed the door casually and suddenly the students were left facing each other.

""I'm not working with *you*, Langely.""  Came a snide voice, piercing the quiet. 

Remillia sighed. This class was mixed with Gryffindors and Slytherins, and the rivalry never took a back step to rear its head at any time. A blonde-tressed girl to her right snorted.

""As if I would be caught dead holding your hand through any sort of class, you git."" 

The initial hostilities seemed to have broke the dam against the arguing of both Houses and Remillia straightened her back and knocked on the door twice rather timidly. The pattering quieted down nearly immediately as Professor Constantine opened the door and overlooked the students. 

""...yes..?""
""We will work individually, sir."" Remillia squeaked. He seemed scarier than before. 
""Wonderful. Now form a line. You have my permission to use anything at your disposal. Spells, curses.... wits. If you have them, of course.""

Alastair, the snot-nosed, snot-personalitied Slytherin pushed his way first. He smirked and drew his wand. 

""This'll be easy. *Impediame--*"" 
*WHACK*
His spellcasting was interrupted by a swift fist to the face. The sound of silence was nearly deafening as all the students and Alaistar looked up in shock and bewilderment. 

""Alaistar Tyrwyn. Fail.""

A small trickle of blood crawled down his face and the boy sheepishly crawled back out of sight. 

""Next.""

The following five minutes were a blur of tears, fear, and utter confusion. One boy was even transported to the Infirmary due to allergic reactions to whatever Constantine put in the water he was doused with. 

Remillia was next. She closed her eyes and prayed her chance was what it took to help her pass this class. She stood outside and faced her professor.

""Um...sir... may I come inside?"" Her heart leaped at the thought of trying something new, and being able to be a class hero for once. Perhaps this was what she needed to pass whatever sort of test the new professor was trying to teach.

Constantine looked at her in the eye for a moment and lit a cigarette. 

""No.""

He slammed the door shut, flicked the lighter closed and took a drag. ",_Greymoon

[WP] Only two types of people get the benefit of life extension technology: The extremely wealthy and those that the wealthy want to suffer endlessly in prison.,Lorix_In_Oz,"Every time I come out of solitary confinement, they drag me. I always tell myself on the way in that it’s going to be different this time. I’ll spend a few minutes every day pretending to jump rope. I’ll do the stretches I learned that time I lost a bet with my wife and had to go with her to yoga class for a month. I’ll pump out push ups, sit ups, and squats -- two hundred a day! Sometimes I even do, for a while. Once, I persevered for an entire decade. But in the end, I always lose it. Despair creeps in, and brings her friends, rage and grief. They huddle on my chest and soon I don’t have the will to do anything. If you lie in one place long enough, eventually you won’t be able to get up again, mortal or not.

So when they come, they have to drag me. Sometimes I wonder if they wait until I’m just the remains of a human being on purpose. Then I remind myself it’s not them. They’re different every time. The fresh-faced kid who escorted me into the cell returns, bald and fat. More often the corrections officers are different people altogether, though.

It’s not them. It’s him. My ex father-in-law, Peter Goldstein. He’s behind my hell on earth, and it’s hard to blame him.

The COs haul me onto a gurney. They don’t bother to restrain me. Once I’m on it two of them peel away, returning to other duties. It’s all very familiar to me, I know exactly where I am going and what is going to happen. A few minutes of travel to the medical facilities. A kind voice and a gentle touch. I will receive lots of physical therapy; the doctors will make me walk again. And then I will return to gen pop. For a while.

It’s an endless cycle. I really have to hand it to Pete, he knows how to exact revenge. The thing about human beings is that we are social creatures. If you throw a man in a cell forever, eventually he will go catatonic. So if you want to torture someone forever, periods of respite are necessary. Apparently, I’m due for one.

Even though I know the purpose of all this, I’m still grateful. I watch the fluorescent lights in the hallway ceiling slide by, and tears trickle down the sides of my face toward my ears. In my real life, I considered myself a hardass, and wouldn’t have been caught dead crying. Not anymore.

Soon we are at the infirmary. I’m hauled up again, this time to a hospital bed. The CO finally goes for the restraints.

“There is no need,” I hear. 

It’s the kind voice, right on schedule. The doctor is a woman this time. I look at her. Her lips are pursed. They’ve seen some action from a tube of red lipstick, if tubes of the stuff are still a thing. Her hair is red, too. Emily’s hair was red.

“You may go,” she says. The COs leave her to her work without argument. I am passive, as if I could be anything else. I look at the ceiling. 

I hear a cabinet opening and closing. The doctor leans over me, into my field of vision. 

“I am Dr. Park,” she says. She is still frowning. “You are very weak. You must drink.” I can’t place her accent. She sticks the tube from a squeeze bottle into my mouth. I obey. The liquid is salty, sweet, and tastes of artificial strawberry.

I wonder why she is not afraid of me. Every female doctor I have seen has been skittish around me, even though it is always obvious at this point that I could do them no harm. Perhaps nobody has told her that I murdered my wife. Maybe nobody in the real world even remembers, except for Pete.

Private prisons are incredible institutions, and none of this would be possible without them. When you’re ultra rich, like Pete, you can just buy yourself a prison. He might just have bought this one, but I like to think he bought a whole chain of them. It would be just like him to do so. He always liked to go big. 

I imagine that I have been legally dead for a very long time. It wouldn’t take much money to bribe a government official, or a series of them if necessary, to file some paperwork. Even if one had a moment of ethical doubt, in the end, nobody really cares about tried and convicted murderers.

If I only had a life sentence on my hands, and fifty or sixty years to endure before I transferred from the custody of Cook Correctional Complex to that of death, it wouldn’t be so bad. Well, obviously, it would still be terrible. But I have an eternity of this misery to look forward to, thanks to science. 

The magic of science. They say that any science sufficiently advanced is indistinguishable from magic. I always scoffed at that in my real life, but science has finally made me a believer. It’s called Life Extension Technology (LET). I still have no idea how it works. But since they inflicted it on me more than a hundred years ago, I know that it does work. The expense is astronomical, but obviously there’s always going to be a market for eternal life.

Basically, I’m screwed. Forever.

Pete explained it to me, the one time he visited me after my conviction. I remember he was wearing a blue shirt that probably cost more than my weekly salary back when I was working at the plant. That was one of the things he never liked about me, of course. Not rich enough to provide his daughter with the lifestyle he felt she deserved.

He didn’t weep, but I would have been astonished if he had. Instead he spoke to me in a brisk, matter-of-fact manner. If I had been a hardass, he was something else entirely. He was like a frozen planet, with all its mass and momentum headed straight for me. He was implacable and intent on crushing me.

I don’t remember everything he said to me, but I do remember his parting volley. “You killed my daughter, and I intend to use my considerable wealth and influence to ensure that you suffer for it. You will suffer until I am satisfied, or for eternity, whichever comes first.” Sure, I remember that. Who wouldn’t?

It’s hard to blame him, like I said. And to be honest, over the long decades I have learned to accept my fate. I’ve even managed to muster up a bit of forgiveness for Pete, because I understand how he feels. I feel it too, and if I had the resources Pete has at his disposal to punish whoever really killed my wife, I’d be tempted to deal with them the same way.

But I don’t. Whoever really killed Emily is most likely long dead, but I will have to pay for it.

[WP] Only two types of people get the benefit of life extension technology: The extremely wealthy and those that the wealthy want to suffer endlessly in prison.,Lorix_In_Oz,"Dr. Park finishes her examination before I can manage to stop leaking from the eyes, and a nurse spoon feeds me some kind of porridge. I sleep. I wake up clean. Someone has bathed me, and I feel sorry for whoever had to do it, because I haven’t washed in years. The re-feeding and resting cycle lasts a week or so, and then the physical therapy begins. That part sucks, but within a month I’m ready to leave for my new life in gen pop. It’s always a little sad for me, because the last week or so of being hospitalized is always my favorite part of the cycle. The staff don’t talk to me very much, but I pretend to sleep and overhear them talking to each other. It’s nice to listen to normal people converse.

I wonder what my cellmate is going to be like. I hope he’s not a freak like Rosco. He liked to make noise at all times, sometimes tapping away at everything with whatever he held in his hands, but more often making smacking noises with his lips. He hardly ever slept or bathed and was so annoying I considered actively trying to get put back into solitary when I lived with him.

But when I arrive at my new cell, healthy enough to be handcuffed, I am cautiously optimistic. The guy is young, and looks clean. He looks at me, and I see an expression flit across his face that I can’t interpret. Is it pity? I’m still in pretty bad shape. It couldn’t possibly be fear.

He gestures to the bottom bunk without saying a word.This might be a pretty decent gen pop cycle for me.

I dream of Emily. We are in the grocery store where we met, and she is smiling at me. She loves me, and she kisses me. I wake up leaking again. She died while I was fishing. I came home and her blood was everywhere. Emily has been dead for longer than most people live.

I readjust quickly to life in gen pop. I’m a skinny, decent looking white guy, but nobody bothers me at all. In the last fifty years, the prison rumor mill has begun to grind in my favor. I haven’t talked about what happened to me in a long time, but most people seem to know anyway. My cellmate, Brian, has enjoyed a little surge in popularity just from being in close proximity to me. Apparently I’m something of a legend. 

Brian is doing ten years for grand theft auto, assault with a deadly weapon, and false imprisonment. His mom refused to take him to the grocery store and give him money, so he forced her into the trunk of her own car at gunpoint, robbed a gas station, and went to the grocery store, where he bought a 2-liter of Pepsi, chicken tenders, and a frozen pizza, then was promptly arrested in the parking lot. He’s not very smart, but takes the ribbing from everyone with good humor. I like him, so it’s a surprise to both of us when I try to kill him.

About a month after I emerge from the infirmary, it is nearly lights out. We’re on our bunks, just hanging out. I was sleepy after a long day in the laundry, and well on my way to dozing off.

“Mark?”

“Brian?"" I mutter.

I see his legs swing out and he comes down and crouches by me. This time I can understand the expression on his face, and it’s definitely fear. He has a folded paper in his hands.

“Mark,” he whispers. “Someone smuggled something in for you.” He swallows heavily and looks at me, then away.

I wake up all the way and sit up. “What? Who would send me something? Everyone I know is dead,” I say, then realize I have broken my rule on not talking about what happened to me. Brian’s mouth falls open, and he stares at me.

“Brian. What is it?” He just keeps looking at me, and I sigh and take the paper out of his hands. I unfold it. My hands are around Brian’s neck. 

He’s much bigger than I am even at my normal weight, and I am still scrawny from the hole, so it’s not hard for him to pry me off. He shoves me away from him and I land on my ass, stunned. He begins to cry, big heaving sobs with his hands over his face.

“Oh my God,” I say. “Brian, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.” Even as I mumble my horrified apologies, I’m reaching for the paper. I grab it, and look again. It’s a white sheet of paper with a picture of my wife printed on it. She is driving a car. Behind her is a bank sign with the time, date, and temperature. June 6th, 2156. Two weeks ago. Her left hand is on the steering wheel, and she is not wearing a wedding ring. She is beautiful, and unmistakable. 

Block letters underneath the picture say, unnecessarily, “YOUR WIFE IS ALIVE.”

“I’m sorry,” Brian whispers.

I don’t stop looking at her until the lights go out.

*****

I barely sleep. I don’t talk. Brian is afraid of me.

It takes me a couple of days to figure it out because I'm so shocked, but the truth is in my bones. Pete set me up. He kidnapped his daughter, my wife, and then framed me for her murder. Three years of politeness in marriage had lulled me into thinking he had accepted me, but he must have seen me right from the beginning as a problem to be dealt with. He couldn’t convince her to leave me, so in the end, he did it his way. He went big.

I wonder what he told Emily. I know there are drugs that can erase memory. Has science struck again? Did he tell her that I tried to kill her? It is killing me, not knowing what she knows. Does she know about the trial? Does she even remember me at all?

Is someone else loving her?

I ask myself all the time why he didn’t just have me killed. Surely he could have murdered me in a way that looked accidental. What kind of monster would go to all this trouble to punish someone eternally for the crime of loving his daughter? The kind of guy who always has to win, I think.

He thinks he’s won. Maybe he even sent me that photo, to taunt and torture me. 

But I have eternity. It’s entirely possible that I have until the sun falls out of the sky. I’m getting out of here, and then maybe he can spend a hundred years on edge, wondering when I’m coming for him.

"[WP] Write about a stone aged human who encounters a time traveler with technology recognizable by the reader, but not the narrator.",Pantaleon26,"The man walked out of the trees while we were trussing up a deer to carry back to the tribe.  He had a thing in his hand and he kept looking at it.  He wore strange pelts that covered his whole person better than any I had seen.  There wasn't any fur on them though but I guess he was okay with that.  It was summer when he came, so you don't need to stay warm.

The thing in his hand was shiny but not like the rocks from the river with water on them.  This was a different kind of shiny.  It reminded me of a rock that a traveler once showed me, a deep dark black like the night and smooth and flat, and it shows you your ghost just like a pond might on a windless cold morning.

When he showed me the thing when we were back with the rest of the tribe, I could see my ghost in its black face.  Black like the night sky when the stars and the moon don't show.  But I could see my ghost in its face.

The man touched the rock and it changed colors.  The broad flat face of it lit up like a fire lights a cave and colors and patterns swirled.  I was frightened by the magic and dropped it, the man just laughed and picked it up and touched the rock a lot.  When he touched it, it changed.

The rock lit up his face like a fire lights up a persons face, but in the wrong color.

When he spoke his tongue was strange.  I've heard strange tongues from travelers, and sometimes somebody in the tribe knows their tongue or somebody in the traveler's group knows our tongue.  Nobody knew this man's tongue, but when he spoke a voice came out of the rock and spoke in our tongue.  It told us that it would give us the meaning of his words, and it would give him the meaning of our words.

The rock says the man has not yet been born, and I do not understand how he can be here if that is true.  The rock says that he was brought here by magic which was wrought by the rock itself, that when he touches the rock just right it brings him here or there and can go back to yesterday and try it again, or it can bring him to tomorrow without having to wait through the night.

I have seen my ghost before.  I have seen it in ponds on still mornings, this does not frighten me.  I have heard rocks speak before as well.  I once met a traveler that could speak without moving his mouth, and could give his voice to rocks.  He explained his tricks to me and they were just that, tricks.  He taught me a little bit of it and I understood it to be of men, not gods or demons.  I was not afraid of this rock when I first saw it and it showed me my ghost, nor even when it spoke to me.

But if this rock can show a man tomorrow before it comes, or give a man a second chance at yesterday?  That is a magic that is not of men.  That is the work of gods.  Or demons.

Tonight when the man sleeps I will save this man from being taken by such frightening forces.  Tonight when the man sleeps I will smash his damned rock.",ferlessleedr

"[WP] Write about a stone aged human who encounters a time traveler with technology recognizable by the reader, but not the narrator.",Pantaleon26,"It has been one full moon since the Sky People landed on our lands, much like how a seed pod falls to the ground from a tree in the spring. From what Tobruk, one of our scouts, said, they have their own tribe surrounding their pod. 

A small party from their group visited our village, four men, four women, and no children. Their hides were not made out of leather, nor were they fur, but something completely different. All of them had small black rocks on their chest, which they could use to communicate with each other, most likely through some sort of spiritual medium. They rested in our village for a short while: four ate at once, while the other four kept guard with their strange spears.

The ones eating pulled out brown bags, made of a different material from their hides, yet still unlike any of the materials we had in our tribe, and sealed at both ends without any stitching at all. From that, they pulled out even more containers, some smaller brown bags, a couple translucent green bags, and a couple brown objects. They tore the brown objects open, revealing even more brown bags. Scattered about each of the eating people were at least 9 bags in total, all of them made out of some unknown material, and each without a single thread of stitching at any of the closed ends. They then grabbed the blue snake hanging off their shoulder to the front of their bodies, and squeezed the head until a stream of clear poison streamed out and into a medium sized green bag with a strange black object and smaller, brown bag inside it. Instantly, the bag began to smoke, probably from the poison reacting with the contents of the green bag, which they propped up against a rock. One of the foreign scouts grabbed her strange looking bracelet, which emitted unnatural noises until she took her hand away. They then began to talk within themselves in a tongue unknown to all of us, even the tribal elders and scouts. From their smiles and laughs, we could still understand that they were happy, regardless of our language barrier; we didn't know if that was necessarily a good sign or not.

The woman's bracelet began to make noises again after a few minutes, at which point she touched it again. The noise stopped almost the instant the put her hand on it. The other ones who weren't guarding their small party began to eat from the brown bag that was formerly in the smoking green bag. Although they had made no fire, their food was steaming hot, just as if we had cooked it on a fire. It had to be sorcery, it had to, or else that could never happen, especially it being cold enough to snow at night.

After the first group had finished eating, they exchanged places with the ones who had been guarding earlier. They repeated the same routine as the previous group, this time with fresh brown bags. An especially skinny, pale-skinned woman took out a small, green tube, and opened it. Inside the bag was some kind of brown food, shaped into a block inside the bag with a green outside, and a shiny inside. This was made of no ordinary intestines, for it was way too shiny, and too loud, to be from any normal animal.

Each of the scouts picked up what remained of their meal, and put the scraps back into the large brown bag, the same one where all the food came from in the first place. As they were preparing to leave however, one of them, a short and wiry man with yellow skin and slanted eyes, pointed at me and motioned for me to come with them. He then motioned for two other of our tribe members to come with them, an old, gray haired woman, and a young girl. We moved cautiously towards them, unsure of what they were going to do with us. They began to lead us three out of our own village, the eight rotating around us like our tribe's hunters when they are hunting large animals, except these had all but 2 people with their spears facing out. The wails of our fellow tribe members as we moved farther and farther away from the village only served to worsen the sinking feeling in our hearts.

"[WP] Write about a stone aged human who encounters a time traveler with technology recognizable by the reader, but not the narrator.",Pantaleon26,"Tuk walked to the Hollow Valley, far from his tribe. Once upon a time he would have been scared to walk alone in the forests but the Men From Nowhere gave him a thing that would scare away animals if he needed to. It scared the wolves but not dogs. He wondered why that was. One of the Nowhere Men, Lilly told him it was because dogs were important, she told him she had one in her home. 

Tuk agreed but he wondered what she would need with one. The Nowhere Men didn't need them to eat, how could they with the warm ice spheres over their heads? They didn't need them for safety either. A bear broke into camp once and attacked Chen, another Nowhere man. Lilly fired lighting from a stick and killed it and Chen wasn't even hurt, the orange hides they wore protected them like a beetle shell.

But the Nowhere men always seemed to care for the things Tuk cared for. They entertained themselves with moving paintings on this glowing wall and stared at lines and dots for hours. Yet when Tuk or the other villagers gave them one of their humble offerings they were always so happy. Tuk would have given Lilly anything just to see her smile but they gave such gifts. The scare boxes, new hides to keep them warm. They even cleaned them.

When Tuk arrived at their camp he saw the rounded white hut, at least five bears high. At its base were these things like birds or beetles that carried the Nowhere Men around wherever they wanted to go. At the base of the hut were paintings the village children had done as a present.

Today Tuk was going to teach Lily and Chen about how you could see the future in a deer's entrails. Tuk sometimes wondered if that was really true. He wondered if anything the wise man said was true. He predicted that the Nowhere Men would bring violence, and yet they brought peace and comfort. He said they were demons sent to test our faith in the Fire and the Sun and Stars. But they had little devices that could summon fire whenever they wanted, and they carried pieces of the sun at the ends of sticks and used them like torches to fight the darkness away. Lilly sat out with Tuk all night once telling him about the stars and all the names her people gave them. She said some of them even came from the stars. 

""An-dro-me-da"" Tuk said absently. That was where Lily was from. Chen said he was from Here but he looked really different from all the Here people. 

Finally Tuk walked over the ridge into the Hollow Vally. Lilly was there in her Blue hide whilst Chen wore his orange one. There was a third man in a white one with dark skin under his warm ice sphere. He must have been one of the others from inside. None of the Here people could go inside, not ever. He carried a lightning stick in his hands. Lily and Chen carried smaller lightning sticks in just one hand.

""Tuk, there you are!"" Lily said in that warm, hissing voice of hers, slightly out of sync with the movements of her mouth. 

""I'm here Lil-Li"" Tuk answered as he staggered down the dip into the valley. ""Who is this?"" Tuk said, pointing at the car new man.

""My name is Captain Percival. I'm-""

""Pur-see-vaal..."" Tuk mouthed he words. ""Are you a warrior. you have the most weapons."" 

""I see myself as a protector."" Percival answered with a slightly annoyed flare of his nostrils.

""Do you keep Lily and Chen and the others safe?"" Tuk asked. ""It brings me much honour to meet the Protector of Lily and Chen.""

""Well the honour's all mine, champ, but today I need to ask for your help."" Percival said slowly.

Tuk rolled the stag off of his shoulders. ""I bought the deer already, we can learn your future too, maybe."" 

""Actually Tuk we're going home for a while and we wanted to know if we could have some of your blood?"" He asked.

""I have been good, my tribe has been good, tell them Chen. Lily, don't let him hurt me."" Tuk paniced as he dropped the deer entirely and began to back away. 

""No Tuk, no one is going to hurt you."" She said as she produced something that looked like a bee stinger but longer. ""We're only going to take a little bit. We need it  to help everyone back home.""

""Please, Tuk."" Chen began. ""Lots of our people are sick but your blood can help them."" 

""The wise man was right, you are demons, you want to eat my blood!"" Tuk screamed as he began looking for a way out. 

Percival leveled his stick. ""Oh fuck this."" And then Tuk's world went black. 

When he woke up he had a pain in his arm and there was a big burn in the ground where the hut used to be. Tuk bought the village back to look around the forrest but they never saw the Nowhere Men again.

“Y u no ever attack when we’re ready!” Reeves yelled as he reached for his golden camo Deagle. Gunfire started cracking around them.”     
“AHHHH MY LEG!” Steve yelled as a bullet struck him. The sound his bone made was like the sound of a dropped bag of Nacho Cheese Doritos. “Help me!”

"[WP] As punishment for losing a war, your country was banned from using the Internet for fifty years. Today is your first day back online",PinkSnuggie,"The device looks ancient, and by all means, it is. But after 50 years of the embargo, it was all we had. We being my grandmother Sue, my grandfather Michael and me the grandchild named Aisha, only there because ""people of your age know your way around technology"" even if the technology is older than I am. I held the device in my hand and examined it. I read the words: ""Hayes"" and the cryptic abbrevation ""56k"" on it. None of which meant jack to me, but my grandpa knew what he did when he connected it to an ancient computer. 

""Do you have the number?"" he asked.

I nodded. I was told to memorize this number for a long time and would get randomly quizzed on it. It made absolutely no sense to me and started with 0053, but I was a good grandchild and did so. I told them the number and then heard a scary noise: beeping and hissing came from the Hayes-thingie. ""Has this broken?""

Sue laughed: ""No, it has not. It always does this when it connects.""

""What is it supposed to do?"" I asked naïvely.

""You know what the Locanet is?""

""It is where the content for our telescreens comes from, right? We can watch speeches of the leader and films and we can buy things if we have enough points, right?"" Points were assigned and deducted by the state for your behavior and even children like me knew that losing points was the worst thing that could happen to you. It could mean cold in the winter, heat in the summer or hunger in any season. It could mean not having clothes or not having shoes. Of course, the leader had to do that: the sanctions after losing the war required resources to be spent wisely and spending resources on those who misbehave was seen as a waste.

""There is a version similar to it which exists internationally. It is called internet. After the war, we had been banished from it. For 50 years. And these 50 years ended today!""

""I don't speak any international language!"" I objected meekly.

""That is not the point. The point is that the internet was far freer than anything the locanet offers. You could put your own thoughts onto it. It was so much more lively!""

I raised the eyebrows: ""So why was that not kept? Resources because sanctions?""

Sue nodded thoughtfully. Michael cleared his throat, but was shushed by Sue. They exchanged glances, I could not understand.

""I have been waiting for 50 years! There is no way I am waiting longer!"" Michael exclaimed as he entered a line of text. Sue explained that you could decide for yourself where to go on the internet and it was not just a few selections you had, but so many that every resource had to have a rather long name. This one for example was called ""wikipedia.org"". 

I started to understand the fascination when I read the information on the various topics Michael and Sue opened and read. Most of these things, we never learned in school. ""Make it our country!"" I suggested.

Sue smiled and new text appeared after a very long time: ""The United States of America is an isolationist dictatorship which after losing World War 3 fell under the power of the Purple Faction, who strictly control the flow of goods and information into and out of the country under the guise of sanctions which never actually existed.""",TenNinetythree

Once upon a time ago 
Twas a lady
Whose world was aglow 
But that was so long ago

Now she withers in her silent pain 
Of a time before she lost her fame
When the lights of love 
Shone down on her 
When she was the star of the show 

Sitting alone with loneliness 
She lets the madman in 
He tells her stories of greater glory
And kisses away all her sins 

He idolizes her and as he should
She used to be Hollywood 
Blockbuster and bigger than life 
Nothing less than the Producers wife 

Oh to have that glory again
The years had not been kind  
Maybe just maybe 
She could find a way to erase time 

She recalled meeting this surgeon 
As she nursed a tonic and gin 
Tomorrow she would track him down 
And together they would begin.

"[WP] Humans finally make the first discovery of alien life, but said aliens have no understanding of the English language and cannot breathe the air on earth.",SirHawkTalk,"The aliens landed. Then they died. Suffocated. Live on BBC News. Fun to watch. A million parents of traumatised children contacted Ofcom while in Whitehall the war machine was just beginning to stir. The aliens had survived long enough for people and politicians to take notice, and, as always when politicians notice something different, they ""pose a credible threat to our society."" This was not how first contact had been expected to go.

Governments around the world met the following day in Geneva to discuss what to do. They could carry on like it didn't happen, after all the aliens were dead so it's not like they would be coming back, or they could try to find more of these aliens with extensive space programs, but that would be too expensive, or they could wait for the arrival of more aliens as they would surely turn up to find out what happened to the ones who died, and then...

""What do we do then?"" Asked the Chancellor of Germany.

""Make contact."" Said the President of France.

""Blow them up."" Said the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom at the same time.

""Blow them up? But why?"" Asked the German Chancellor.

""They pose a credible threat to society."" Said the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.

""But they can't even breathe air! How the hell do you expect them to destroy society?"" Asked an agitated German Chancellor.

""I don't know, but when the colonialists arrived in America that didn't exactly work out for the native Americans."" Replied the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.

""That's actually a really good point, the native Americans could never have predicted smallpox, let's blow them up."" Agreed the President of France.

""Whoa am I the only sane person here?"" Asked the German Chancellor.

""Shut up you started the war."" Said the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.

""I wasn't alive in the war!"" Replied the Chancellor of Germany.

""Never mind that I'm off to go and test out Trident."" Replied the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.

The following week more aliens showed up to try to communicate with Earth and retrieve their dead. Both tasks were pointless because their dead were being dissected in Area 51 by the United States government and the people of Earth had already decided to blow them up (the vote went 97-96 in favour of doing so). Navy members on the United Kingdom's nuclear submarines braced themselves for shooting, something they had trained to do but never thought would actually happen. The Prime Minister addressed the nation. The nuclear weapons were fired, and the aliens just moved slightly out of the way and were fine. So they decided to retaliate with something much bigger. Nobody on Earth remembers what happened after that because they all died in the resultant explosion. The nuclear weapon fired by the United Kingdom hit the sun a few days later, finally answering the stupid AskReddit question ""what happens if we nuke the sun?"" But there was nobody left to acknowledge it.",JackHarrison1010
[WP] If we could manipulate sound waves with our minds.,Sorrow_down,"Jason didn't remember when he first realized what he could do. It felt like his whole life he could make people hear what they wanted to hear but which part was his skills of persuasion and which part was due to his ability he didn't know. There wasn't a better power for a teenager to have though, girls heard exactly what they wanted to- some days he gave thoughtful emotional advice and other days he was the funniest man on the planet; he was never sure what he actually said. The manipulation of the waves made his voice velvety smooth to a woman and if that voice was supposed to be funny well by darn she'd laugh harder than she'd ever laughed before.

"[WP] The point of view of someone who fails the ""secret test of character""",Tarantula24,"I glanced with disgust at the wrinkly old man who sat outside the tavern, begging. He had appeared out of nowhere earlier in the week; no one seemed to know who he was or where he came from. ""What do you want, baldie?"" I asked scathingly when his clouded eyes gaped up at my own perfectly functional ones.


""Some coin for the road, if you would be so kind,"" he said with a voice weathered by the decades. 


I turned my pockets inside out to show their emptiness. ""Sorry, old man, I have nothing. And even if I did, I'd be spending it in there,"" I said, nodding toward the entrance to the town's only supply of liquor. ""Which is probably what you'd do with it, too, if I gave you any."" 


I crossed the street and made to keep on my way. As I left, I noticed the tavern-keeper's daughter bringing the old coot a leg of lamb. The good stuff, it looked like. My mouth watered. By the gods, she was such a pushover. 


The next time I saw oldie outside the tavern, the merchant's son, Laimas, was sitting next to him and sharing a bowl of gruel. I guess he was rich enough to do that, what with his father being the richest trader this side of the river, and all. I only made enough in a day to feed myself and save a little bit for the tax man. 


Weeks went by and the man gradually made his way into a room at the inn. I guess the innkeeper took pity on him or something. I saw Laimas and the tavern-keeper's daughter, Zenna, packing supplies for a long journey. I knew them to be cousins, but perhaps there was a marriage in the works. Zenna would never marry beneath her class, so a working man like myself never stood a chance with her. The pickings were few and far between; besides Laimas, there were Gren and Senwin, but they were either too young (Gren was only 11) or far too old (Senwin, the perpetually-single but rich artisan, was pushing 40 and looked like he would keel over at any time). 


Well, you can imagine my surprise when it turned out they were taking the old bald man from the inn with them. I picked my jaw up from the mud when I spotted the trio leaving town with a single horse and carriage. The old man stood upright at nearly 6 feet tall! He had a walking stick but no need for one as his strength was evident in the length of his stride. His beard flowed majestically in the wind as he turned back and gazed at me one last time with eyes as clear as a pristine lake. 


Word around town was that once he had gathered supplies for his journey, he rewarded the innkeeper, the merchant, and the tavern owner with gold pieces bearing the king's likeness on them. The old bastard was the king's wizard coming to seek an apprentice. 


Many weeks passed and many in our village became sick. I myself acquired a fever which refused to break for many days. The doctor thought for sure that I would die, until one day a wizened old crone entered into the infirmary. She went from bed to bed, administering some sort of poultice medicine to each patient. When she got to my bed, she stared down into my eyes. In my fevered state, I swore that I saw them cloud over and her face morph into that of the old man. 


She looked over at the doctor and nodded. ""This one will do just fine,"" she croaked, before covering my face with a foul-smelling cloth. Everything went dark.


I awoke drenched in my own sweat and feeling more parched than the fields after a drought. Laimas looked down at me sympathetically. There was no hint of recognition in his eyes. 

""Don't worry, old man,"" he said kindly. ""You're in good hands.""

Old man? Who was he calling old man? I attempted to sit up, but my limbs were weak from their period of disuse. Laimas assisted me in my second attempt. Once I was upright, I caught a glance of my face in the mirror across the room and promptly fainted. Staring back at me was the face of the bald old man from the inn. ",jadefyrexiii
[IP] Valley of Shadow,TheGinofGan,"""Thou art mine now,"" the voice hisses, leaning towards the human. One, six, a dozen voices layered atop each other, twisted and dark.

The knight turns lethargically towards the speaker, juddering up and down as her destrier runs on, heedless of the phantasm plaguing his rider.

Its body underneath its cloak was cast in deep shadow, darker than the grave, rendering it inscrutable; one of his bone-thin arms wrapped around the knight's waist in a cruel parody of a lover's embrace. Blood and ichor oozed from a jagged gap in the front of her armor, souvenir of the strike that took her life.

""I wouldst use thee as my proxy,"" the voice continues, whispering its fel intentions into her ear. Her armor, once bright and gleaming, begins to rapidly tarnish under its influence.

""Bringing death to those above; yea, thou shalt have thy revenge."" Her armor is almost completely black now, her mount not immune to the spreading corruption as he, too, changes color.

The figure glides along beside her, heedless of the world around them, pointing with one outstretched arm. ""Now, go, my charge. Seek the world above, seek thy revenge.""

It lets her go, disappearing in the distance behind her as she runs on, towards the light and the world she so recently left...",Claymore729

The it comes up in an instant. There is a picture of a black woman, tired, frazzled hair, Holy shit is that how bad my hair looks? Its the view from the web cam.

That's scary. But the other stuff is worse.

Birth certificate, Detroit, father line, blank as ever, seems some how bigger here.

GED certificate, 2 year college degree rolled into 4 year at an out of state college. Grade point so low you thought it was a blood alcohol content at first.

How the fuck did they get all this. X / Close / END

Stupid warning: Do you really want to leave without changing difficulty?

It's not meant to say that is it? Something about wanting to leave the page.

Fuck it.

You got Easy, Normal, Hard, Very Hard, Extreme

Sliding the slider to Hard. Holy shit. How do they do that? Its my face - kind of. I look white, or asain, or some mix. I can move my face the web cam changes it shit that's some powerful computing. A quick glance at the birth certificate has a father's name. Fucking rubbing it in. The other lines have changed but what ever.

Finally the itch gets to you. Normal. Now I'm from Fuck! Palmer woods. Attended Rice, engineering, nice. 50k in student loan debt though, pay check stubs from dow. That can't be bad.

Already. Easy. HA. I'm a white dude. Look at me Bro. What the fuck. Harvard, nice. Parents, upper east side, shit.

I stood in line at the 7/11. I recounted the change to make sure I had enough for the bean burrito and the King Cobra. My mind wandered back three years ago. How had I gotten here? I was just finishing my freshmen year at college back then. A full ride, a great girlfriend, and nothing but great things ahead of me. Yet here I was. A week from homelessness, single, and nothing to my name.
I got off the bus at my stop and slowly walked back to my apartment. As I went to unlock the door my phone rang. I dropped the beer and the burrito and almost threw my phone. Who could be calling me and how was it even ringing? I hadn't paid the bill in months. The caller ID said unknown and I figured it was a bill collector. I cussed at my luck. I had no beer, no food, and no money now. The phone stopped ringing and I went inside. Screw the mess, someone else can deal with it.
I closed the door and sat on the floor and cried. I cried for what felt like an eternity and only stopped when my eyes couldn't produce anymore tears. This is it I told myself. This is how you die. Cold, alone, hungry.
My thoughts suddenly shifted back to the phone call. It was all their fault. If I could have my beer and a meal I would have been okay. And then the phone rang.
I stared at the screen and it rang again and again. I answered and screamed into the phone. I couldn't tell you what I said or how long I yelled, but the person on the other end stayed quiet. After a few moments of silence an almost robotic voice asked if I was done.
I couldn't bring myself to speak. The voice chimed back in, but I was too dazed to hear what he said. He spoke slower this time, in an almost trance like tone. Are you happy with your life?
I laughed and spat back how in the world anyone could be happy living like this. I'll take that as a no he responded. Would you like to reset difficulty and start from a previous save?
This couldn't be real. Life isn't a video game. You don't get to go back and make things easier for yourself. I laughed at the absurdity of the situation and mockingly said yes please take me back to the end of my freshman year and change difficulty to very easy. The line went dead and I snapped.
I ran out my door and down the stairs. I ran as hard and as fast as I could. My lungs burned and my legs ached, but I didn't stop. I ran until I got to the bridge and jumped. The cold water took what little breath I had.
I dove under the water and headed straight down. The light began to dim and then there was nothing. I didn't know if I was still going down or up but I swam. When I couldn't hold it any longer I gulped in the salty water. Drowning was harder than I had thought. My body didn't want to die and involuntarily started pushing for where I thought the surface was.
The darkness faded away and I could see the surface, but I knew I wouldn't make it. I clawed at my throat as if somehow I could make myself breathe the murky water. Everything slowed down and it was over.
I woke suddenly gasping for air. I was no longer in the water. I was confused. I knew I had died. There was no way I came out of that alive. My surroundings seemed familiar, but I couldn't quite place them. Was this purgatory? Was I going to hell for killing myself?
A soft knock brought me out of my thoughts. A face I knew all too well peered in and asked if I was alright. It was my mom. I hadn't seen or talked to her since the incident that sent my life spiraling out of control.
I sputtered out that I was okay and she asked if I wanted blueberry pancakes for breakfast. I could only nod. She closed the door and I looked around the room again. I was in my old room. I got out of the bed and went to the bathroom.
I looked into the mirror and the face I saw didn't match the one I had grown accustomed to. I looked younger and more alive. I slapped myself to make sure I wasn't dreaming. It stung. It was the best feeling I could remember.",mteuton

Oddly enough, you just got an email titled ""Would you like to change the difficulty? Current setting: Very Hard.""",TheRaidKing,"As I tossed the last can of generic, cheap beer I had left to my name, I sobbed. I’m not an alcoholic, but my girlfriend of 5 years was cheating on me and alcohol was the last thing holding reality at bay. Now that was gone too. Jenny and I had met in college and I thought that we had a great thing going on. There had been no warning or signs that I was being betrayed, but the texts and pictures on her phone didn’t lie. Could they?

My phone vibrated in my pocket. Instinctively I picked it out and the screen burned bright white in the dark room. An email to my private address I didn’t give out to anyone but my friends and family. I didn’t even sign up for any accounts using this address. With a great sob and a few moments to wipe the tears from eyes so I could read the letter, I unlocked my phone and glanced at the subject line.

Curiously, there was no sender address and the subject line read, “Would you like to...” before it ran out of room on the small screen. 

*What the hell... How did advertisers get their hands on this email address? I bet they’re asking if I want to change the size of my penis. Fuck. If only that shit worked, maybe I wouldn’t be losing Jenny to some hung guy.*

I clicked to open the email and stared at it, puzzled. “Would you like to change the difficulty?”

*Sure. I’d love to do that. Lemme just go ahead and ask God to look down on me with pity and let me off easy. I’ve suffered enough haven’t I? In a world where children starve and are sold in slave markets, I of course am the most wretched and deserving of this opportunity. Or maybe I am just the most pitiable human with an email address. Sure.*

I clicked to move the email to the trash folder and plugged in my phone to charge for the long restless night that awaited.

---------------------------------

4:17AM

Still tossing and turning, trying to find a moment of peaceful rest where I wasn’t haunted by the thought of my life crumbling around me, I glanced at the dull red LED of the alarm clock by my bedside table. Silent tears had wet the pillow case as I had tried to sleep. More cruel than the thought that Jenny had cheated on me and left me were the dreams where we were still happy together. Every time I had gotten even a cycle of sleep, those blissful dreams had haunted me. As soon as I awoke, it was like finding out that she was with someone else again for the first time.

I grabbed my phone, determined not to let these blissful nightmares another chance to take hold of me. The blinding white light hurt my eyes and it took a few moments for them to adjust and let me read again.

“Would you like to change...”

*This shit again? I thought I had deleted it the first time it came in. Must have misclicked in my drunken haze. Oh well.*

I moved the email to the trash again and opened Sync for Reddit. 

After almost an hour, I had gone through all the interesting topics on the Front Page if the Internet and clicked the back button to exit the app. As it closed, behind it was my Gmail app again.

*Stupid inconsistent back button behavior. What the... I’m sure I deleted the email this time. Oh what the hell. It can’t hurt and I’m desperate enough to give this a try. Hell, I’ve already prayed and I don’t believe in God. This can’t be any worse.*

“Yes.”

“Select new difficulty...”

The reply came in quicker than the email from the subscribe button on a page full of malware. I opened the new mail and found 4 simple buttons.

* Easy
* Medium
* Hard
* **Very Hard**

*Have I been playing life on Very Hard mode so far? Well... Some of it was. I had been diagnosed with cancer when I was 15, lost my parents on the vacation the Make a Wish Foundation had set up, lost my scholarship to UCLA when I had been caught smoking weed and was taken in and charged with a misdemeanor. Some of it made sense, but at the same time, I had met Jenny, my cancer had gone into remission, I was able to find loans to pay for college, and even gotten into that great research program they offered. But then again, very hard was not “nightmare mode.” Maybe I was just that good at life!*

As I began to imagine how life would be on easy or even medium difficulty, I hovered over the easy button. A heartbeat later, I clicked on it. 

A voice sounded in the room and yet I knew it was only in my head. 

“New difficulty, easy. Settings saved.”

My heart raced but I was exhausted. Maybe I had just imagined the voice. I probably did. As I continued to argue in my head, I drifted off to sleep, forgetting the demons that lay in my dreams.

He unbuckled his belt and slipped out of his pants before he was even half way through the door.  
He was starving...hadn't eaten since the morning.   He took a hard look at his kitchen, it was filthy...probably nothing that wasn't rotting in the fridge.

He dove onto his bed and wept a short while.

He flipped open his ancient laptop and sifted through all the emails reminding him of his debts until he saw an email from Wendy.
""I'm not coming home tonight

Sent from Frank's iPad""

Hours passed until he heard the distinct ""DING"" from his email received notification.

""Thought I muted this shit..."" he muttered as he looked at the laptop.
New email titled: ""Would you like to change the difficulty? Current Setting: Very Hard""

Connor stared at his screen...and clicked into the email.
The body read.



&gt;""Hello Connor08011996,
&gt;
&gt;I have noticed that you are having a very rough time working with the difficulty settings that your parents set for &gt;you at birth.  Not everyone gets to use console for the setup of their child and Very Hard is not a setting that is &gt;recommended unless they start off with a LOT of help; help you did not get.
&gt;
&gt;Now...I'm not admitting any liability/fault here, but I'm offering you several options to make your experience in &gt;the beta a little more enjoyable.
&gt;
&gt;You may only choose ONE of the following options: When you use one, the others will deactivate.
&gt;Before you fall asleep, think of the time that you stole that toy at Mr. O'Flanahan's toy store when your family &gt;went to Niagara Falls.  Specifically think of how you told your mother that ""it was a gift from the owner for being &gt;such a good boy"".
&gt;You will be prompted for which option:
&gt;
&gt;1.) Console (Cheat Engine) -  Say ""Cheater""
&gt;
&gt;You'll fall asleep and go into settings.  Now I've preconfigured access so that you can get THREE uses of console, &gt;so make good use of each session.
&gt;
&gt;Onto the cheats.
&gt;You'll be able to give yourself more money (up to $250,000 USD each session), alter your appearance, take a &gt;boost to your stats (I've given you 50 points that you can distribute), change your relationship stats with others &gt;(once per session), and save/load your progress (Only 1 save/load per session).
&gt;
&gt;Normally, you get no achievements for using this...but I'll let it slide for you.  
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;2.) Difficulty Change: Say ""Difficulty Change""
&gt;You will appear in a room with Six different blocks.
&gt;1 through 6.  
&gt;
&gt;1 represents VERY EASY
&gt;
&gt;2 represents EASY
&gt;
&gt;3 represents NORMAL (Default)
&gt;
&gt;4 represents HARD (All tasks +100% difficulty)
&gt;
&gt;5 represents VERY HARD (All tasks +300% difficulty)
&gt;
&gt;6 represents DEBUG (All tasks effectively impossible, please do not choose)
&gt;
&gt;Choose your new difficulty by punching through the block of your choice.  
&gt;You will wake up, and resume.  No penalty for doing this...thought you will not get any of the possible rewards for &gt;completing your existing quests.
&gt;
&gt;3.) Restart: Say ""Restart""
&gt;Nothing fancy here, you get a complete redo.  
&gt;Same difficulty, but you will have retain all knowledge up to this decision.
&gt;You regain all skills at the age of 5...so you will have a few years where you get to relearn motor skills and things &gt;like using your vocal chords.  
&gt;
&gt;Hope this helps.
&gt;I'm cheering for you kid.
&gt;
&gt;Yours Truly,
&gt;JC (Creator, Admin)""



Connor didn't know what to think.
He...didn't even know what to make of this.
NO ONE knew about that toy he stole.  

He closed the laptop once more and stared into the space that his TV used to occupy...what should he do?

I feel like, I mean, the least weird thing about it is that God is emailing from the European Union. Letting alone allll of the other weirdness.”

I shook my head.

“I dunno, something about it seems real.”

“Oh, you can sense the sanctity of this holy email through your touchscreen? Look, I guarantee if you send anything back you’re going to get a request for credit card details cleverly wrapped in some super great sounding Euro-church-pyramid scheme. Sell croissants and hand-sized bibles for a profit.” Kelly handed the phone back to me, pushing her glasses back up her nose with her free hand. She leaned on the counter next to the cash register and stared at me through her thick lenses. Radiohead wailed in the background, something about a shitty day. Behind her the weak winter sunlight filtered through the patchwork of oversized band posters that covered the high windows of the shop. Someone had cut the eyes out of Snoop Dogg so that he knelt next to a lowrider, a joint in his hands and sunshine bleeding out of his pupil-less eyes. 

“Kelly, at this point I think giving my credit card details to a shadowy European Church pyramid scheme could only enhance my credit score.”

“I think credit scores can go negative, Dave. Or if they can’t, then they might change the rules for you- do you want to be the first guy they do that to? Get it named after you? The ‘Dave is a self-pitying loser who replied to God’ credit score bracket?""

“Jesus, Kelly. A break?”

I slumped forward, laying the phone and my head on the display counter. The glass felt cool on my forehead and I could see through the numberless scratches to an unopened Rolling Stones vinyl, where Mick jeered at me with his knobbly claymation-looking face. 

“Sorry, Dave.” She sounded genuine. “It’s just… I mean, you kind of did get yourself here. If your life is set on Very Hard, what’s a Somali refugee’s life set on? There’s no ‘Fucked Since Birth’ setting in video games, although I don’t doubt some people would want to play it if it existed. Hmmm, that might be worth writing down- a game where you have to escape your horrible birth circumstances but no matter what you do you can’t win-”

“CHELSEA WAS THE BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME” I wailed, my breath fogging the glass. Across the shop, an old guy in a furry hoodie looked over at me. 

“No,” Said Kelly. I could hear the eye roll, even though I couldn’t see her. “Chelsea was the hottest thing to ever happen to you. She was also the most psychotic, and the most dramatic, and the most banging other dudes-ic.”
I let out a moan that sent the old guy with the hoodie backpeadaling for the doors.

“Sorry, sorry. It’s just, my tax dollars pay for your broke ass’ Planned Parenthood treatments and now that Chelsea’s gone and the little guy is clearing up-”

“Why do I come here, Kelly? You are the opposite of a kind old bartender with wisdom beyond his years.”

“You come here because, as I already mentioned, your ass is way more than broke. But, cheer up. I have changed my mind.”

I looked up at her. 

“You should totally reply to this email. Say, ‘Yeah, thanks, I want life set to very easy, with cheat codes enabled and maybe one of those mods where everyone has a big head, like in Goldeneye.’ And then if it works, you split your easy life with me. I’ll get you to do all the stuff that’s hard and you’ll do it as a thank you for always being there for you, even when you were at your most annoyingly depressive.”

She popped her gum and shoved the phone back at me over the counter. 

“I’m gonna do it.”

“Yeah, then do it.”

I slid down and sat on the ground in front of the counter, thumbs tapping away. After a few moments, I pushed send and the tinny whoosh of an un-take-backable email sounded from the phone. 

“What’d you say?”

“Pretty much all of it, except for the Goldeneye stuff. I feel like, one, if it really is God, that seems rude to ask for, like I’m making fun of him and two, if it actually happens it would be super gross.”

“Pussy. Can I help you?”

The man standing in front of us was tall, easily over six feet, and entirely dressed in white. White tennies, white slacks, an incredibly soft-looking white sweater, and white sporty sunglasses pushed up on his pale forehead. 

“Dave?” He asked, pointing at me on the floor.

“Uh.” I scrambled to my feet, exchanging a look with Kelly, who shrugged. “Yeah, are you…”

The man ignored me, pulling out a slim white phone from his pocket. He checked something, then flicked his eyes back at me, smiling now. 

“Very easy it is.” He said, and flicked his fingers at me. 
	
I can’t deny, life is pretty great now. Naps in the sun, a backyard full of mice and long grass, fresh wet food twice a day (Kelly always buys the good shit too, real fish flakes up in this bitch!), and the occasional back alley rendezvous with the siamese from down the street. Do I ever regret replying to God? Not on your fucking life. ",eeepgrandpa

Oddly enough, you just got an email titled ""Would you like to change the difficulty? Current setting: Very Hard.""",TheRaidKing,"I broke my fixation on the woefully empty bottle of beer to glance down at my phone as it *dinged*, notifying me about an email. I sighed. Debt collectors and spam. That's all I ever got anymore. At least the latter allowed me the pleasure of pressing the fun little trashcan icon. 

**Would you like to change...**, the preview of the subject read. Hell, yeah. I would give anything to change everything right now. My girlfriend was gone on some escapade with her not-so-secret lover, my student loan debt was three times what I made in a year, pre-taxes, the eviction notice was still taped to the door... I hadn't been too broke to buy beer since college, but here I was. Same old.

I swiped right and typed in the double 69 password; a relic from more cheerful times. The email was short and to the point.

**Would you like to change the difficulty? Current setting: Very hard.** Seemed about as legit as the Nigerian prince my grandpa was always helping out. My finger hovered over the trashcan icon but my phone *dinged* again, the echo bouncing off the walls of the nearly empty room. A text this time with the same message and a simple instruction: **Reply YES for details**. I shrugged and typed the message, arching my eyebrows skeptically as the message *whooshed* away and I turned back to the bottle hoping to leach out a couple more drops.

**Pick your level: First World Problems, Easy, Medium, Hard, Very Hard**. I sighed. Whoever this was, they were persistent. A cruel joke, most likely. Getting my hopes up that my life could be anything more than a miserable shit hole. I chose the first option and hit send, shrugging in mild irritation before sighing and heading to my bed. Without the electric bills paid and nothing to entertain me, I was sleeping by dusk, my schedule more Amish than an Ohioan's. My phone rang a moment later, just as I was settling in and starting to tell myself a bedtime story.

""Mom?"" I said hesitantly, surprised that she would call after six months of not talking to me. She let out a muffled sob and I sat up in my bed. ""What happened?""

""It's dad..."" she stuttered as she struggled to catch her breath. I frowned. My dad had been getting cigarettes since '95 and if he was suddenly showing up now, I wanted nothing to do with him. ""Your grandfather passed away,"" she said quietly and I scowled. Disrupting my 8 o'clock bedtime for this? The man was a grade A dumbass and had provided more for random hookers than he had for me.

""I... I'm sorry,"" I managed to say half-heartedly.

""You barely knew him,"" she answered softly. ""I can't see what he saw, but he must have thought very highly of you. He left you his fortune and the house by the lake. You're rich..."" she said mournfully and I quietly gulped as I tried to fathom the idea.

""Goddammit,"" I sighed knocking my head against the headboard of the bed. ""I'm gonna have a shit ton of taxes to do.""

Oddly enough, you just got an email titled ""Would you like to change the difficulty? Current setting: Very Hard.""",TheRaidKing,"Jeb sat back deep in the couch and ripped off the tab of his last beer. He figured he might as well enjoy both of them while they lasted: beer, even when he had it, didn't last very long, and his couch was due for repo by those bank sumbitches.

Looking around his piece-o-shit apartment (as he liked to call it) Jeb reflected that things hadn't gotten easier, as they'd said it would down at the congregation. Jeb believed in God, and he believed in that slimy rat fuck who spread Gods word and took his ten dollars every Sunday, but as of yet Jeb had yet to see God helping out. 

Downing the last of his final beer (and vaguely wondering where his next would come from. Beer that is. Or paycheck. Same thing, really), Jeb burped loudly.

""This is some bullshit,"" he exclaimed.

He scratched his nuts, thinking that would help. It did. For a bit. Not for long though. The itch always came back. Fuckin' bitch Katrina. 

""Never trust a woman named after a hurricane,"" he said to no-one in particular. He thought back to the whiskey, the dinners, the late nights they had spent together, and wondered how much of dent all that wasted time would have made in his loans. Sure, a diploma in Electrical Engineering wasn't a big deal to any of his prospective employers (also good-for-nothing rat fucks, he decided, trying to extract one more drop of Indian Pale from the dessicated can in his hand), but the bank certainly didn't think so. 75 big ones. Ain't no joke, far as anyone's concerned. 

Jeb stood up from his dusty, moth-eaten couch just as generations of O'Thompson losers had before him and walked over to the computer. 

'*Might as well check the old e-mails*,' he said, again, to no one at all. '*Welfare don't like it if'n you don't send out a few shots in the dark e'ry now and then*.'

There were no replies, of course. No golden e-handshakes welcoming him onto the team, no promises of riches and happiness beyond measure. Hell, there wasn't even a note from the Nigerian lawyer who promised to get back to him after that deposit last week. 

And suddenly: a bing.

Jeb's eyes widened. His heart stepped up its pace a few murmurs, and his hand shook on the mouse. 

Could this be it?

Jeb's dire hopes faded, however, as he read the subject line. To be precise, there was none. He thought that wasn't a thing people could do anymore, but given what that tornado-in-human-form had done, well, nothing really surprised him anymore. 

He clicked the link.

""Would you like to change the difficulty?"" Jeb read, his lips twisting visibly as they silently contorted out the various slow syllables of the sentence. ""Current setting: Very Hard.""

He laughed out loud. That ol' bastard Tucker, up to his tricks again. He chortled as he clicked the reply button. '*I'll show him, that prankster*,' he thought, a grin plastering itself across his grimy face. '*Thinks I's so dumb I don't know what tamara is*.'

His index fingers poked and prodded slowly across the keyboard, a tongue protruding its grey, wet mass out of the corner of Jeb's mouth as he formented his brilliant response. 

""Too Easy,"" he typed, a thick, guttural chuckle coughing from his midsection. ""Gimme Nightmare Mode.""

Reading his enviable handiwork, Jeb laughed a second time. Ol' Tuck. How dumb'd'he think ol' Jebediah was? His finger hovered over the send button for a second [*but what if it's real what if this ain't no joke what if this is your one*] before hitting 'send'. 

""That'll show him.""

There was the longest moment where nothing happened, and then the phone rang.

Jeb (frankly surprised he still had a phone, and that it was still connected to the network) jumped in his seat. Rocketing from his chair, he flung himself through his pizza boxes and porn mags and all the detritus that only a 26-year-old bachelor can accumulate. 

And there it was. A dull red, heavy thing. He snatched it to one ear. 

""You almost got me, Tuck ya ol' fu...""

""Mr O'Thompson? Is this a bad time?""

Jeb heard his surname being used. No one used surnames. Not unless...

""Uh yeah, I can talk. Not doin' much.""

""Mr Thompson, my name is Dr Fischer. You might remember me from...""

""Oh shit, Dr Faggy. You the one cupped my balls and all!"" he laughed into the receiver. Saying that word, he scratched again. Fuckin' bitch. 

""Er... well... yes, I ran your medical about sixteen months ago."" There was a harsh silence on the phone, a dark, crackling that cut into the ear harder than static. ""I wanted to call to say... oh God, I can't believe this, but... well, there's been a slight mix up.""

""A...? A mix up? What do'ya... wha...""

""It seems that... well, to be perfectly honest, we mixed up a scan...""

Jeb's brain... slowed. There was this... Pop. A finality. 

""What?"" was all that came out.

""Well, it seems that when we did your CAT-scan for your medical insurance, we had another O'Thompson that day. A Jeremiah O'Thompson. Fortunately, we've been able to rectify his side of this tale - his scan is clear - but your... Mr O-Thompson? Mr O'Thompson?""

The phone fell to the floor with a thud.

Hello, 
This is the L.I.F.E. admin, we've noticed that your difficulty was set to Very Hard a few years ago and we're seeing that you've been struggling to make ends meet as of late. If you'd like to change your difficulty, reply to this email with ""Yes"" followed by a comma and the difficulty of your choice.
Difficulty choices are: Very Easy, Easy, Medium(Default), Hard, Very Hard, and Impossible.


Matthew mulled over what to do. It seemed like bullshit, but if it was real... How could he know? He he looked at the last line again. ""Impossible? are you kidding me? There's no way life could be any harder than it is now."" He hit the reply button and typed, ""Yes, Impossible,"" and then hit send.

Matthew sat there waiting for a reply, he was pretty sure they were going to ask him to wire money in or something. His phone buzzed again. ""Lets see what they want now,"" Matthew said as he opened the email.


We're processing your request, changes will take effect the next time you wake up.


Matthew looked up at the clock. It was only 9:12, but he decided to go to sleep. He didn't want to be awake when his girlfriend came by drunk and full of some other guy's seed. Matthew thought about it and decided he was done with her as he drifted to sleep on his couch.

Matthew awoke the next day with a bag on his head, in scorching heat. He couldn't tell what was going on. He heard voices, speaking in another language. Then the bag on his head was removed. He saw his landlord smiling at him. ""This is what you get, asshole. I sold all your shit to get you here, and now,"" His landlord was saying to him, ""Well now you're this guys bitch.

She lost her girlfriend in the cruelest way possible: a thirteen second voicemail clearly recorded at a party. A voicemail that awful girl clearly hadn't meant to send. Her head hurt. She was all cried out and had exhausted her Taylor Swift playlist.


If that wasn't enough, she had been waiting all day for Alice to come home to mourn her job. She hate working there, but this made it that much harder to pay the student loans worth several of her body parts on the black market. She wished she could figure out where the black market was.


She was out of beer, too, because beer costed money she didn't have. That and Alice took the last of it with her to that party she said was a meeting with a client.


It never was a client, was it?


She was moping. She hated to mope, but she couldn't find the strength to do anything else.
Her phone cawed from across the room where she'd thrown it earlier.

She stood and walked to it, head dizzy. Probably Alice looking for a ride home. Or realizing she'd fucked up big time.


She looked at the screen. There was a giant crack in the middle, which was to be expected but was still just another setback she couldn't afford right then.

She looked at it in puzzlement. She hadn't gotten spam emails since that blocker came out, worth the money she should have used on food. So maybe it wasn't spam. She clicked on the email.

My phone buzzed. A text? Was she here? No, an email. No subject, sender was some random string of numbers and letters, only one line of text: ""Would you like to change the difficulty? Current level: Very Hard.""


Weird. Maybe Jeff was pulling a prank? Jeff's pranks usually sucked though. Ketchup packets under the toilet seat, shaving cream on a slice of pie. Fuck it, I decided. I typed ""Yes"" and hit send.


The reply was almost instantaneous. ""Please choose level: Easy Medium Hard Very Hard Extremely Hard"". I typed ""Easy"" and hit send. I waited. Nothing seemed to be happening. I laughed at myself for thinking anything would, which meant I felt far less nervous when I heard the knock at the door. Had to be her. I walked over and opened it.

""Who the hell are you? Where's Jamal?"" She pushed past me into the apartment. ""Jamal? Baby, you here?""


Perplexed, I responded, ""Shonda, it's me, what are you talking about?""


She wheeled around and shot me a suspicious look, as if I was the one hiding something. ""The hell are *you* talking about? I've never seen you before in my life!""

El sucked at the lip of an empty Corona, studying her reflection in the sun-bright screen. 

No makeup. Too-fat mouth. Short hair still manic from the pillow where she'd sheltered, feigning sleep, while Jackie texted with her ex. She'd considered calling her out, raising hell, hurling invective and glassware until the girl fled, but even a cheating partner was better than nothing. She'd let the tryst continue.

Her focus flickered back to the email. 

**Would you like to change the difficulty level?**

The sender field was blank, as usual. Whoever kept sending these, week after week, must have scheduled them out for months in advance. She moved it to the Spam folder, only to see another message take its place.

**Would you like to change the difficulty level?**

El shook the Corona. Nothing left. She could see the empty fridge in her mind. Nothing but condiments and molding bread and Jackie's homemade (putrid) sun tea. She tilted the bottle back and felt the last drop flatten, warm, on her tongue. 

**Would you like to change the difficulty level?**

Home row. Index on 'J.' Her fingertips hovered. Hammered. Replied.

*Will this affect my achievements?*

Send.

She might not have beer or love or work or hope, but her snark was intact. That was something. Right?

A new, bolded subject line. 

**Would you like to change the difficulty level? This will not affect your achievements.**

*Sure. Let's change it.*

**Please choose a new difficulty level.**

*What are my options?*

**Current setting: very hard. Options: easy, average, hard, very hard, impossible**

El considered. 

""Easy"" could mean a lot of things. A story mode game with a heart-breaking narrative. An uninterrupted foray into fantasy. But it could also mean slogging through worlds robbed of challenge. A smothering softness. Life with no edge.

She looked toward the bed, at the rumple of sheets on Jackie's side, at the bottle of Corona sitting empty, at the contortion of lime collapsed in its neck, at the credit card statements that fanned from the table. Would an easier life be better? Would less stress mean more happiness?

*What would you choose?*

The inbox sat quiet.

El sighed, stood. Hooked the neck of the bottle between her fingers and walked it back to the kitchen sink. The recycling was full, piled high with useless catalogs. Beneath the first two: a ticket stub. Something artsy. A date. Jackie-- overconfident--barely even trying to hide the affair. 

The inbox pinged.

**Would you like to change the difficulty level?**

She took the recycling to the curb. Made the bed. Stacked the bills.

Tomorrow--Sunday--she'd ask Jackie to leave. She had unemployment coming. Enough, maybe, to make the rent on her own. And if not, there were other rentals. Other women. Other ways.

El leaned over the keyboard, squinting through the screen glare, and typed her response.

*No.*

She hit send.",worst_draft

The only email's George had been getting for the past month were bad emails, emails he wished he did not have to worry about. The last email he got simply had the subject line ""Pack up your things."", it's pretty easy to tell by the subject line what that meant. 


So George finally opens up that new email, it had the subject line ""Would you like to change the difficulty? Current setting: Very Hard"", and George has been all sorts of weird subject lines come through his inbox over the last couple of years at his previous job as an sysadmin at one of the top tech companies in the world, subject lines like ""I think I F'd up"" or his favourite ""HELP"". So George though about it for a few minutes, he is in huge debt (and can't even afford a beer), he is behind on rent, he think Tessi was cheating on him. But he decides to delete it since it seems like a scam...... 


George comes back to his laptop a few hours later and goes into his email trash and re-reads the subject line. He decides that either it is going to help him turn his life around or he is going to die a poor and sad man. The first line says ""I know life has been hard on you, I know you either want to die or get your life turned around. Here's your chance.

I can't spell-check at work (notepad)! I've had about 2 hours sleep in 2 days and need to stay awake.

Clack, clack, tink tink tink.

The sound of another crushed can hitting the piled up recycle bin and rolling on the floor. It's been 5 days and the 40lt bin was already full. My last can for god knows how long.

I looked around, and everything about this place was depressing. All that remained was an old 54'' back-projector based T.V that was busted, worth maybe $30 in recycled plastic. Two piss-stained couches I got from my Dad's mate, an overflowed rubbish bin, and a small pile of un-clean dishes. I didn't even have a bed left. All of it gone.

My girlfriend is cheating on me with my former best mate. I found out about 3 weeks ago from an old friend of mine. She got sent a message from her a while back, and out of respect she told me. Cassie was that sort of person. Even if she didn't like you, she respected you enough to make sure you knew. She let me know countless times over the last 10 years that I was nothing short of an asshole and a complete dick. I guess making sure that I recognized her awesome work in the computer lab while in highschool got me some sort of respect.

I got fired two weeks ago. From manager of a transport company, revoked of position and put to a forklift driver, then one single dint on a god damn trailer and I got sacked. The same day another forklift driver put his tines through a pallet of alcohol and got sent home because he seemed ""off his game"". My dint was a $20 fix...

The eviction notice was pending. I knew it was coming, sitting there on my bench. For the 5th time since I moved in, I failed to pay the $340/w rent, which is cause for eviction. I had 14 days.

The only thing left was my phone. I paid the bill off with the last of my money while drunk. I had no power, no gas, only cold water and darkness, but I still managed to charge my phone at McDonalds with their portable chargers. Amazing what a 50c cone can get you.

Ding.

The fuck was that? Was that an email? The last time my phone dinged for an un-read email is was another scam-artist using a new email address.

Ding.

Was that another one? The fuck do they want?

I pulled out my phone, swiped up and smacked in 1337. The last remnant of my ""uber gaming past"". Outlook was still installed, and had a (2) highlighted on it.

""Notification pending...""

Who the hell titles an email called that? And all the body contains is ""The system has noticed a change in situation. Notifications pending: 1. For more information please await further instructions"".

Right, another spam bot. Slap the mark as junk button and swipe up to the newest email.

""[Notification] Difficulty settings Pending review"" Ok, spam bot is going ham. What the hell is th-...

""Would you like to change your difficulty settings? Current leve-"" The email was cut off due to the preview of the inbox. The crap is this stupid spam bot on about? There's a body to the email but no sender's address? Screw it. There's got to be more.

I raised an eyebrow as I tapped into the full email.

""Would you like to change your difficulty settings? Current level: Very Hard  
Please reply with YES to continue, or NO to keep the current setting""

The fuck kind of bot is this? Screw this. Junk, tap, tap, swipe.

I didn't even get a chance to lock the phone before an exact replacement email came in, identical to the last one. I squinted in confusion. Junk, tap, tap, swipe. The moment I swiped, it appeared again. That 'aint right... Fine, what ever, let's do this. Tap reply, smash in YES as hard as possible, send and press lock button.

I waited about 30 seconds, no new email. That's all the bot needed to piss off? Good.

Ding.

""[Settings] Difficulty &gt; Select New Difficulty"" What?

Alright... Open this up.

""Your current difficulty: Very Hard

Available difficulties: Easy, Normal, Hard, Very Hard, Impossible""

Alrighty... Let's go with Easy. Tap, reply, send. My phone went black. God fucking damnit it was some fucking bullshit phone virus shit. I fucking KNEW it was bulls-

The phone began to boot up, but not into Android. ""Droidekka v23.11"" Okay, what? Is that a new operating system? It looks identical to Android, but there's a few apps I've never seen.

""Clearing premesis! Alex, please remain seated! You three, clear the house""

What the fuck? Is this a SWAT raid?

""Please remain calm Alex. Because of the situation, this needs to be done""

A few moments, and a few police gripping their holsters passing by me, I hear 5 shout Clear, and then footsteps down my hall. I stand up and turn around and there stands 3 guys in suits, armed police in uniform, and a fairly sized suitcase wrapped in gold.

The box had only one item inside of it. A revolver. There was a bullet in the chamber. I knew what it was for...

For the love of all things holy, when the heck will this end?! I've been here for months!

Zaurin was sat in a beautiful apartment overlooking New London, all the old landmarks had slowly disappeared as each new generation came along. He liked the view, but that was it. His girlfriend Peya had finally left him after months of clearly being unhappy. He just couldn't keep her attention, turns out she'd moved in with some guy who had an apartment in Tottenham 560, no car, no money, but he was an artist or something.

Why heck did I bother to get all these things if I can't even keep a girl with them?! Zaurin thought about all the things he could have spent his money on, experiences, skills, but no. He went for the high ball lifestyle.

He stood up and walked through his open plan penthouse apartment to shower in his ensuite shower room with rare real stone on the walls. Real water too, not those awful nano-showers, he couldn't stand those bots on his body, not even the terrible steam shots his friends had for him. No, real h2o. So rare now the subscription for it cost him all the money he should have spent on his £75k student loan debt. Well originally £75k, with the hyper-inflation probably at least a thousand times that by now.
He finished up in the shower, savouring the feeling for a while before reluctantly leaving to dress. Only the best today, he dressed like he was as rich as he looked.

As he walked out of the room he activated his kitchen synths and bots.

""Beer""

error

""What?! Beer!""

error. contact supplier.

Crap. Looks like his unpaid grocery bills were finally catching up with him. Can't even afford a beer.

He thought back to how he'd decided to handle the situation with his boss. PharmaSol's vice director was not one to allow insubordination. Zaurin thought he was striking just the right level of ambition, after all, he was damned charismatic. He should be able to pull that off. Apparently not.

So no job, no money, not even beer. He'd have to stop and get synthetic Gin on his way. He'd need the courage. Suicide is never easy. Even when it's in a game. 

Granted, LifeLike was literally lifelike, so it would feel as real as everything else he'd experienced: the love, the money, the sex, the feeling of sand... All that cliched stuff. But seriously he had been trying to beat this game for literally years now. He'd gone through at least twenty generations of his chosen family, slowly building up his EXP, game cash, he'd not even used real money to buy those add-ons. He was sick of it. Spent literally hundreds of years and now when he had everything set up it all went wrong. No save game to go back to, no safety net, just failure. All that grinding at awful jobs for lifetimes to get to this point and BAM! All gone.
He sent messages through the game to the devs but they never replied, not personally, the auto-response replies were painfully forced. So, with no children born in this generation to keep the game going, death would be GAME OVER, and finally he could get back to real life. It couldn't be worse than this.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As he teetered, slightly drunk from the synthgin, on the edge of New London's largest building, he heard a strange noise. It was like a mobile phone ringing. Man. It had been literally hundreds of years since he'd heard that. The noise was behind him and made him turn. What looked like a genuine 2015 Apple iPhone 6s was laid on the ground ringing!

Okay, calm down. That's only a collectors item worth literally octillioseptrinxes of Yen. That would at least pay his student debt! Maybe even leave some for some beer and a...

No, end it. It's been long enough now.

He turned back around and steadied himself.

JAMES RICKHART!
JAMES RICKHART!

Zuiran's heart almost stopped. He hadn't heard that name in what felt like forever. His... yeah... surely, his real name! His username had been everything now for so long he'd actually forgotten.

JAMES RICKHART YOU MUST STEP AWAY AND ANSWER THE PHONE

WE HAVE AN IMPORTANT OFFER FOR YOU

THIS JANE FORITZ FROM THE DEV TEAM.

Ha! The Devs finally get in touch after months of him asking to leave. Every time they just replied with an auto reply email saying he could reduce his in-game difficulty setting. He never played games on anything less than Very Difficult. What's the point of an easy game?

Nah, too little too late, time to get back to reality, he didn't care how much he'd spent to be part of this game. He jumped.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the development office at LifeLike Studios, New London, Jane sat stunned. No. It hadn't...

She checked the code again. It must have been a glitch, a mistake. She double checked.

No 

He'd done it, he'd jumped. 

Suddenly she started sweating, cold sweat. Her head was spinning. She'd said this would happen, they listened to her, but a majority vote decided that it would be chaos to release the information. 10,000 players all finding out that the processes to tie their mind to the game had worked, but not as expected. The game didn't run faster than real life like they expected. Telling them they only existed on the memory banks of the servers of LifeLike would unleash a tornado of reactions they said, they wouldn't even know how to help the players. Better to keep them happy for as long as possible, give them easier settings, more money, more alcohol. Teams of designers and developers worked to keep creating new changes for the game, the world the players lived in. Everybody knew it couldn't go on forever.

She had a decision to make. No, she didn't, she knew what to do. She synced her stem drive to the interface in front of her and downloaded all the files about James Rickhart. People had to know. This would cost LifeLike octoseptrinxes of Yen when it came out; but what's the price for human lives?

---------------------------------------

I slowly opened my door to yet another dreary, pointless day of my existence. It's quite saddening that it had come to this point in my own home, but it happens I guess. It's been a rough day with all the back and forths the boss made me do for no real reason alongside people just generally not realizing that when I say no, I mean no.

In my mental recap, I missed something on the floor. My foot arrived sharply towards a cold thing which I wouldn't know about until after physics worked it's magic and gave me the sensation known as pain to my foot.

I spoke some unintelligible nonsense, very rudely involving my rather fun day and went to go pick up what my foot had smashed into.

An empty beer bottle. Upon closer inspection I saw something long and plastic stuck to the side that would've looked very out of place. Suddenly, I wished I hadn't. Wow Adam, I didn't need you to finish my beer and fuck my girlfriend too. Who let you in here in the first place? Sigh, forget it. Might as well just dispose of it by chucking it out the window into the alley, no one cares anyway.

I slowly sat down in my chair after removing my backpack. How I wished I could feel the sensation of taking off the weight off my back more often, but sadly it's not going to be the case for a long time. I don't think I'll be able to sleep any easily considering that I could lose a place to sleep within a snap of my landlord's fingers. I'm actually surprised she didn't come up and... nah let's not tempt fate here. I already did quite a bit of it today.

Sat up straight in my seat and reached for my backpack to pull my laptop out. After doing so, I was greeted with a nice warning message that I'd lose battery power in about 15 minutes. You must be joking. More shit to deal with today though.

I saw a slight disturbance on my desktop. It was my web browser playing a soft tone. Oh nice, another email. Let's check it while I have a little battery life. I don't think it'll kill my battery and I'll certainly plug in my laptop afterward because I at least remembered to take my power charger.

The bolded email that gave the notification was titled ""Would you like to change the difficulty? Current setting: Very Hard.""

I must've blinked 10 times straight. I mean, what the hell. A random email asking me about out the difficulty of my life huh. I chuckled a little. Anon here was pretty good at the guessing game. He didn't seem to be harmless at all though. Maybe this was just something for motivation I guess, probably nothing as a whole, but probably some mental strength which is what I need right now.

My fingers fly across the keys with no effort and typed ""Normal."" I'm not sure why I said normal, but I'm guessing it's because I wanted to work for myself and try to get myself going after pissing away my times when I was younger. A new chance per se.

I hit enter, and it straight up sent the message. Another blinking procedure of mine. Never had an email program do that to me before. Oh well. I slunk back and slowly felt sleep rolling in.

Right before sleep took me, I sharply remembered something: *there was no sender.* But that's when I fell asleep, right in my chair.

***

I woke up to my doorbell. Someone was really interested in meeting me huh. I guess today was the day I finally get kicked out of this shitho-.

I opened the door and was face to face with an elderly woman. It wasn't my landlord, she'd act like a cranky grandma right now.

It was my mother.

""What is it?"" I asked bitterly and groggily. Nice, now I get to be scolded by her too. First running away from home to live like this and see the world, to being in a shit situation.

I didn't get a response at first, but then I saw the tears.

""I'm sorry.""

I was speechless. Normally my parents would've been quite harsh and pretty stubborn on anything they'd say and do. But an apology? This was unheard of.

""Er, any reason for this?"" I doubt this was out of goodwill. There had to be an ulterior motive, there always is.

But I could never think of one. Cynicism is in my blood, but today I found nothing.

""We are truly sorry for not realizing what you truly wanted and why you left,"" she started. ""I can't think of any other way to apologize because we were truly rash."" Well, you did stifle your son's future just a tad bit by ruining his first chance at an authentic job when he was 19 and making him miss a crucial step in his first relationship so it's ok I guess?

""You're not going to live like this anymore. As an apology, let us handle all of the financial issues you are having. It's too much for you right now considering where you are living.""

I was speechless. ""Er, it's no need I'll be fi-""

""FINE?"" I was taken aback by her tone shift. ""You've been living here with your financial condition and your friends that have dropped you off the earth and you say you're fine???!! Shut up, we're going to handle everything for now. We're going to let you do as you want, but you're coming home to have lunch first.""

Rupert slumped in his chair and opened up his favorite porn website. ""April O'Neil sex Michelangelo"", he typed in the search bar. He unbuttoned his jeans on his pants with his right hand while opening his desk drawer with the left and set his bottle of lotion next to his keyboard. With his hand still fumbling to unzip his jeans, one pump. Two pumps. He stabilized the bottle and gave a more forceful pump with his right hand. ""Mother fuck, goddamnit. Out of lotion too! Real fucking funny!"" he said as he threw the bottle of lotion across the room, striking his TV, making a huge crack in the center. ""Ha ha... haha"" he chuckled, slightly surprised at the hint of psycho in his voice. 

DING!

""Oh an email. What now? Have they made it illegal to watch TMNT porn? Give a guy a fuckin' break I tell ya..."" he muttered to himself as he zipped his pants back up and sat up in his chair. He leaned towards the computer, only the blue glow of the screen illuminating his face in the dark room. He scratched his poor excuse of a beard and licked his chapped lips. 

""Would you like to change the difficulty? Current setting: Very hard."" was the title of his new email. Rupert looked around the room for a second and whispered to himself ""Probably fucking Rob heard something about Robin. Hell I bet he's fucking her himself. That would be... FUCKING PERFECT"" his voice raised to a shout. 

""Nothing in the body? Who sent me this... '011001110110111101100100@RupertLife.com' Am I high? Cause that would be pretty nice. Well YES sir I would like to have an easier difficulty ha ha ha."" Rupert typed into the reply box. ""Yes please."" Send. 

Nothing happened for a few minutes. Rupert stood up and walked into his kitchen, squinting his eyes as this room actually had the lights on. He walked over to sink and ripped a plate out from the stack of dirty pots and pans. ""Eh.. not particularly sticky. Should be good to go"" He reached for the wall cabinet and pulled out a blueberry poptart. Still 3 packets left. ""OH YEA. Fuckin' got somethin' going for me."" He said with genuine enthusiasm. He opened all three packets and popped the six pop tarts in the toaster oven. He rummaged through the fridge, chucking out two pizza boxes and a couple McDonald's takeout bags in the process. Hid underneath the bag was a six pack of beer. ""BOOM! I could have sworn I was out of this. Thank you Jeebus!"" Rupert set the six pack on the kitchen counter and threw his arms in the air. 

His iPhone dinged to let him know he got a new email. He entered his passcode as the cracked screen scratched his thumb. ""2 New emails: (1) Your request for forebearance... (2) Your difficulty level has..."" the screen displayed. His feeling of joy suddenly switched to anxiety as he eagerly tapped the notification and opened his email app. ""Your request for forebearance has been approved. Your next payment will not be expected for..."" was all he had to read. Rupert fell to his knees almost feeling like he was going to cry. ""I mean it's not that big a deal, but it helps. Thank you Mr. Loan dude sir."" 

Rupert was back in his room with his feet on top of his desk, happily drinking beer with a pile of pop tart crumbs on his chest. He was surprised at how good of a mood he was in, he didn't even have to jack off to feel good. All he needed was Simpsons re-runs and his last 2 beers which would make him pleasantly drunk. He had to thank his genes for making a six pack of beer just enough to make him buzzed without feeling sick. 

""Oh yea I had another email!"" Rupert pulled out his phone, still keeping one eye on his computer screen. ""Subject Line: Your difficulty level has been reduced to 'Hard'."" ""Body: Greetings Rupert, Your difficulty level has been reduced to hard. Would you like to keep these settings?"" Rupert was too tipsy to be annoyed with the fact that someone was obviously fucking with him ""Thank you Mr. 0101! If this is all part of some prank where you give me Poptarts, beer and convince those bastards to give me a forebearance then hell this is great. Let's try a bit more..."" he keyed in ""Reduce to Very Easy"" and hit reply. 

He had just about set his phone on his desk when it dinged. He opened his new email. ""Subject: Re: Difficulty Change Request"" ""Body: Greetings Rupert, Your difficulty level cannot be reduced to Very Easy without a system reboot. Would you like to perform a system reboot and change the difficulty level?"" Rupert  keyed in ""Yes"" and hit send. ""What kind of Matrix shit are they going to pull now?"" Rupert said as he chuckled to himself.

Rupert slouched back in his chair and selected the next episode. He was about to take a sip of beer when he felt a sneeze coming on. It was a big one, he took a huge breath as if he was about to be forced underwater. He quickly swirled his chair around to let out the massive sneeze so as not to spray the pop tart crumbs everywhere. His eyes clenched shut as the big ""CHOO"" came. It was the most relieving sensation of his life and as he opened his eyes his surroundings looked much different. 

His chair had turned into an amazingly plush bed, the fabric had to have been silk. There was beautiful antique furniture everywhere and through the window he could see the ocean. He must have been in some beach penthouse. ""What the fuck? I'm rich!"" Rupert cried. Before he could even take in all his surroundings a beautiful woman with an amazing body walked in, stark naked. ""Yes. I agree with this."" Rupert said, whispering to himself. ""Aw you're awake now, Rupert!"" the woman said as she walked towards him. Now he noticed that she was wearing something: a watch and black high heels. She leaned in close to him, he could feel her long blonde hair touch his chest as she got close to his face. ""You're so cute, aren't you!!"" she said as she kissed his face. Something was odd though, as if her face was abnormally large. ""What the. Wait a minute"" Rupert blurted out. ""Aw! Robert! Little Rupert is trying to talk!"" she shouted towards the doorway. ""Hey what the fuck I'm not-"" Rupert objected. ""Come on Daddy, your son is trying to speak to us!"" 

Rupert always hated New Game +'s

I hit send.

Almost as soon as I left clicked the box to confirm, I heard my front door burst in. I'd invisioned this exact scenario before. It was the mafia come by to collect on an old debt from when I'd taken a shit on Don Rovalio's lawn. The look on his fat mug was all I needed to see back then, after his goons had chased me for four blocks and smacked me square in the back of the head with a four-by-four. The Don never had gotten me to square up on those ""loans"" and really it was a testament to my thick skull and the good brain behind it that I was alive now. Alive enough to grab the rifle I kept by my bed, and to fold out the 14 inch bayonet, anyway.

""I told you fuckin' canoli's not to come round here no more!"" I shouted. I took a position behine the headboard of my bed and leveled the rifle at the door.

The apartment was suddenly quiet. Outside I heard a loud bassy rumble, a sound like anyone who lived near a port might think was a ships horn.

It was then that I saw a thin sliver of amber light spread out from the keyhole. It passed from one side of the room to the other.

I shot at the door and a hole appeared. I cocked back the bolt and the acrid smoke of gunpowder filled my nostrils.

Outside I heard the rumble again, then another sound. A helicopter maybe, and in the distance - sirens? maybe - *screams?*

A dribble of green liquid fell from the bullet hole in the door and seconds later it was ripped from the hinges as eight furious, determined arms hefted it above an eyeless head. Then the door rocketed past me to my left and out of a third story window. I let out every round the rifle held at the thing and nevertheless it stood. Its many mouths vomited a frothy green liquid which dripped variously onto carpet and faux hardwood.

I fought back my senses enough to leave my cover. I rushed the thing in my doorway with the bayonet. The blade moved in and out, in and out. More times than I could count I stabbed its heaving mass. When it finally fell it let out a hellish noise of both confusion and contempt -- *ggrrnnnnn ngreckk?* -- then my floor shook with the bulk of it.

I rested one leg on what appeared to be its stomach to make sure it stayed down and looked over my shoulder and out of the shattered bedroom window.

In the distance, the city burned green flames, and helicopters fell from the sky like late dragonflies.",fentanylplz

Sunlight warmed my cheek, and for a moment I was delighted.  I lazily caressed Giselle's perfect bottom in a reassuringly possessive way, and she murmured happily, still in her dream.

Having been born to a life of luxury, I never really imagined what life was like for common people, but in that blasted dream, I was just some poor slob named Harry, stuck living in a shithole apartment that ought to be condemned.  (Ugh, I wouldn't stay in a place like that if they paid *me!*)  I hadn't paid my debts, not because I was dishonorable or because they were ""good"" debt, but because I *actually couldn't afford to repay them*.  I had recently lost a piddly service job that was somehow important to my survival.

Without enough money (and I can't even fathom how the other half live on the crumbs we leave them), I couldn't pay my debts or overdue rent, maintain a healthy relationship, or even afford the cheap, vile beer that ""I"" somehow preferred.

The last thing I knew, I had received a strange email, asking me if I wanted an easier life.  I said yes, and the nightmare ended.

Ding! Speak of the devil, an email in real life!  Let's see...

Do you have the motivation to open it? Can you focus for that long? Fuck it, delete. Everything else that seemed real 6 months ago has drained away. What’s the point of getting your hopes up? 

Your girlfriend comes home, you hear her downstairs. She’s bustling around, yelling “Hello?” loudly because she always does that when she walks in the house. You don’t answer her, you don’t care. And you always hated when she did that. “Hello you fuckin skank” you whisper under your breath. She’s moving out next month; she didn’t even pay rent for last month. 
You look back at your emails, one from your old boss. He just got let go. Too bad, good guy. You look around the room. Rumpled blankets on the bed, 6 pens on your night stand, mid-morning light streaming in through the window. It looks beautiful outside. You get up to take a look. 
A dog is there, running round in your neighbor’s yard. It runs by a bush, between the two garages. Your eyes stay there, at the bush. How did it grow there, where there is so little light? From a twig to such a thick bush, impossible to cross. You look back in the room, and catch your gaze on a mirror. You look at your face. Are you good looking? Good looking enough? You first look at your eyes, then into them. Deeper still. 
The bush is on your mind. Twig to bush, impossible to cross.

I walked into my apartment to see a good amount of my stuff had gone missing, empty spaces in my tv stand where my once expensive Blu ray player and Xbox One was were now empty. What the hell!? Now I'm getting robbed? I looked around and saw all of Christine's stuff was missing too. My eyes drew to the coffee table where a note was left by her that simply read:

""I moved on, enjoy your life with what I left you."" 

Fuck! She stole my Xbox and my Bluray player. I can't call her because my damn phone is cut off. I poured myself a glass of Rite Aid Brand Whiskey and sat in front of my laptop that luckily she hadn't gotten to. I opened up my Gmail and scrolled through the spam and Overdue notices from Capitol One and my Renting Agency until I came across a subject that caught my eye:

'Do you wish to change the difficulty?'

Better than anything else in my inbox I decided to open it up and see what it was about:

Dante! How are you doing buddy, my name is Jason and I'm the Admin for your server that your life is running on and I've noticed someone had set your difficulty way too high and you've been grinding through life without much reward. You have not too many skills or abilities so I thought I throw you some to give you an advantage as I can't really lower the difficulty but I can give you some perks to even the odds. Here's a few prefabs I wrote up you can choose from:

Batman/Bruce Wayne - You will now have unlimited skill and will to accomplish the things you want and much better physical ability and agility.

Taskmaster - Nothing is special anymore when it comes to talent to you, if you see someone do something you can now replicate it perfectly. Use this one wisely

Wolverine - You will heal from any injury as long as you give yourself 10 seconds to recover, you will be a much, much, better fighter as well

*RESTRICTED*

Frank Castle - Time those who did you wrong paid for there actions, you will now have top military training and physical ability but will actively seek out punishment for all those who've done you wrong. 

I scrolled through and read all my choices and clicked the one I wanted, the one I really needed. 

""Thank you for your choice"" the screen read as my laptop screen powered off. I looked over to my coffee table and saw a vest laid on top of it, a white skull sprawled across it. with a assault rifle on my couch.

Life had been rough lately but at least I can still have a good laugh. I suppose that speaks to the resolve of the human spirit. I saunter towards the cupboard and paw around the top self. Aha! I knew I'd kept a stash in case of an emergency. The emergency was ""downsizing"" this time. I shake my head and pour myself a whiskey over ice -- I could never drink my whiskey neat. As I recline in my favorite chair I hold the glass close to my nose and inhale.


All I can smell right now are the notes of deceit. I've read her texts. I know who and what she's been licking. It hurts but not to worry; a few sips of this magic and I'll be right-as-rain. The booze touches my lips and relaxation begins to set in. My thoughts drift to college. College was one hell of a time.


Another chuckle. Another sip.


Too many women and drugs. Too much fun. I was a bright kid and I was brimming with potential but I was distracted. I'll go back one day and I'll prove it -- I'll buckle down and focus on what matters. I'll do something practical this time like engineering or maybe architecture. I've always been mathematically inclined.


I down the glass and pour myself another drink.


The words *mathematically inclined* linger. Can I count to 73? How about 73 thousand? One, two, three…


I take another sip before I reach 10 and within the hour I'm waist deep in tears and regret. This is not surprising.


I open my laptop, ready for some instant gratification but the email from earlier is still open. It gives me a tinge of hope. 


*Would you like to change the difficulty? Current setting: Very hard.*


I feel a little embarrassed for considering it but I click the link anyway. My full name covers the top half of the screen and below it are 4 stacked buttons with the top-most selected:

    • Extremely Hard
    • Impossible

It was a place to rest his head, the elevator was always broken and his neighbors always fought. His head hangs low, full of thoughts, as he runs his hand through his hair, he reaches for a cigarette. Slouching at the kitchen table it wobbles, one leg is slightly shorter than the rest. He pulls the ash tray closer, only adding to the little ash mountain.

For the past month Charlie tried reaching out to his girlfriend, Elizabeth. Their distance is a void that gets amplified by seeing her with mutual friends, but no ounce of effort to reach back is extended from her. He remembers the last time he ran across her at work, which doesn't normally happen, due to the different departments. He remembered, she came walking by, giggling with a coworker after glancing and catching his eye. She proceeded to lean in, curtsy and give a ""Well, Hello"" almost gleefully. He never felt so alone at that very moment. His train of thought is interrupted with his phone chiming in the distance, anxious to hear from her he grows a half grin on his face and rushes to his phone. The number is an 721 number, he answers, *scoffs* ""Hi, we are informing you that your student loan deferment process has been declined and a two month late fee of four hundred and eighteen dollars and eighty nine cents"" rambles on in a mechanical voice... *click*

Charlie scrolls through his contacts, thinking about someone he can call to vent too, a couple of minutes go by. Then another couple of minutes... he thinks to himself, ""Why does this have to be such a struggle?"" He tilts his head back, takes a long drag, shifting his thoughts away from feeling alone to feeling like a failure. *snubs out cherry of the cigarette in a deliberate motion* He wonders, is this what being a 29 year old ""adult"" supposed to be like? He ask himself. 

Charlie was an avid subscriber to Maxim and other trendy ""popular"" magazines.  He glances at the recent mail delivery, on the front cover depicts a well dressed man with an athletic build and swooped back jet black hair. Just the perfect shade of tan, clean shaved... ""Why does that depict success?!"" He yells out loud.

"[WP] ""So, what brings you here today?""",WhoaSamurai,"I walked into the bar at 4pm on a Saturday, already drunk from polishing off all the whiskey in my house. At 4pm, there aren't any loud college kids or annoying preppy kids, just the ""regulars,"" the people who are married to their drink. Honestly, I can see when distorting one's reality is the best, maybe only decision for an individual. One of the only reasons why you walk into a bar into a bar on Saturday afternoon, is to dilute your mind, fade away.

Initially after walking in, I was hit with the strong smell of stale cigarettes, an ever living presence, a familiar substance, purchased only to kill us quicker. I wasn't coming to this bar to make friends, and either was anyone else. No one raised their head when I entered the bar, the only friend these men needed was their gin and tonic. 

Sitting at a table alone is one of the most depressing things, staring at nothing but the hard wooden seat across from you, only the comfort of a cold drink to wash away the hatred and resentment. When you sit at the bar, on the ripped wooden stool, it sucks you into a concoction of alcohol and isolation. True, that usually was the case, but that night was different. I never would have guessed the man sitting two seats down would save my life by asking the simple question, ""What brings you here today?"" 

When he first spoke, I couldn't tell if he was British, or Irish, due to his lisping and the mumbling of his sudden inquiry. After asking the bartender for a Whiskey split with coke, to start the night off easy, I responded.

""For the atmosphere.""

""Ay, a smart ass. I'm guessing that Whiskey n' coke won't hurt too?""

""I'm pacing myself, starting the night off with ease.""

""None of the other lads coming in 'ere start off easy. They come stumbling in, asking for there's biggest bottle of gin! This ain't the bar for pacing, look around ya, boy! Half of the men in 'ere are asleep, sucking they thumb!""

""The difference between them and me, is that I'm not here to celebrate. I'm here to sit and drink, quietly.""

""Oh, the reflective type, ain't they? I understand, not all men are loud and horrid. Some of the wisest men in history kept to themselves. I'm sorry for gettin' in yer way.""

At this point, I couldn't decide if he was making fun of me, or if I actually made a friend in this pit of a bar. I couldn't just leave the conversation at that, drinking until my liver fails. I had to make an effort, I responded after a long pause.

""You weren't getting in my way, just to let you know. It's just- I've had a bad week, you know? And I, um- needed to decompress.""

""No, I understand that very well. Every man in this bar has had a bad week, that's why we here, to wash it away. [Pause] If ye don't mind me asking, what happened this week that made ye so angry?""

""My girlfriend and I got into a big fight, and she told me not to come back home. It's been five days, and she still won't let me in.""

""Ay, women, they torture men because they knows we need them. If sh' truly love they, they'll come around to ye, and reconcile.""

""I wish it was that easy- uh- I'm sorry, I didn't get your name?""

""Me God given name is Abe, the Father of multitude. I didn't get the pleasure of your name either.""

""Thomas- Tom.""

""Ay, Thomas, I like that name. So, Thomas, let's asking th' important questions. What will ye find at the bottom of th' glass?""

I was stunned by the questioned, surprised a fellow drinker, a stranger, ask what the purpose of drinking was. Everyone knew the purpose, there was none, only to dilute one's mind. There were no answers, but when you are asked a question like this, you must answer.

""Why are you here?""

""I asked ye first, and once ye answer, I will answer whatever th' heart desires to ask.""

""The liquor serves as filter for reality. My world is too painful to face the hideous and indifferent without the aid of alcohol.""

""An honest answer, I respect ye for knowing the full extent of th' actions. The dumbest men in th' world are the most arrogant. What do you plan to do to fix th' broken reality?""

""Another drink, bartender.""

""I don't know if all that is broken can be fixed. My girlfriend and I are soul mates, and I can't honestly imagine a world where she's not in it.""

""Many say that live could be worse, but they don't know the situation. You can't let th' bad dictate ye life. Ye must find what is good in life, and make amends with ye misfortunes."" 

I know this advice might seem simple, general, and empty. But this man, Abe, prevented me from making a permanent mistake. Shortly after this advice, I left that bar to meet up with my girlfriend, your mother. See, you never know another person's situation, so treat every one with the respect and dignity they deserve. Many suffer to the point where only an altered state-of-mind can bring happiness.

I went back to that bar the next day, as soon as they opened, hoping for Abe to walk through that front door. After weeks of waiting, drinking one seltzer after another, I never saw the man who saved my life again. I hope his drink didn't consume him, I just wish he could have known how his wisdom saved me.

"[WP] ""So, what brings you here today?""",WhoaSamurai,"""So, what brings you here today?"" a tall man with a chest of medals asks a much smaller man in a sarcastic tone.

""I need a gift for my wife, our anniversary is coming up"" the clueless smaller man answers.

""Likely story. Who do you work for, the Russians? I bet it's those goddamn Chinese. Third one of you we've found around here this year!"" He bellows. 

The smaller man begins to pick up on the severity of his situation, ""Honestly! I was just out looking for something for Janine! Our anniversary is tomorrow and would you guess that I forgot to get her something, again. 23rd year in a row, you think I wouldn't forget this time but...""

As he begins to trail off and murmur to himself the decorated man cuts him off. ""So you're telling me you woke up today, realized you needed to get your wife an anniversary present, and decided one of the highest level security military bases in the United States would have just the perfect gift to her liking for you're little anniversary?""

The smaller man looks embarrassed and squeaks out ""So you're telling me this isn't the mall...""

""Jesus Christ. I don't know whats worse, that a spy would actually try to use this story, what has got to be history's unanimously worst cover story ever, or the fact that someone as stupid as you exists in the same world that I live in that they could legitimately wander in here. How the hell did you even get passed security?"" the general demanded.

""I... don't know...""

""You don't know? How does one not know how they end up somewhere""

""Have you ever heard of Angry Birds?""

""What in the hell does that have to do with anything...""

The small man perked up a bit and replied ""Well ya see, I just can't put the game down! I was walking towards this mall and decided I would try to squeeze a couple rounds out. I just bought angry birds space and hadn't had a chance to play it. Next thing I know am dragged into this room to talk to you. I just figured the guy at the kiosk who tries to buff my nails was trying out a much more aggressive approach. Still wasn't gonna let him touch this fingers! I need em to sling some birds!""

The general stared at him in disbelief that someone with such a small IQ and infinitesimally minute situational awareness could exist. He opened his mouth to say something but just left the cramped interrogation room with his jaw still hanging open in shock.

A few minutes pass by, the small man playing Angry Birds on his phone, not noticing the general speaking with another large military higher up outside. The general returns to the room and instructs him as calmly as he can.

""Well we've background checked you and there is nothing out of the ordinary. We reviewed our security footage and you weren't lying. You just happened to walk through at the most opportune moment on God's green Earth. You're free to go and will be escorted off the premise with a bag over your head to protect any military secrets. Now excuse me, I have a few security guards to go fire.""

""Okie dokie! Can I finish this round first?""

Having not finished his last round, a new set of security guards threw him out of the building. He immediately pulls his phone out and begins to walk, head consumed in his game again. A discrete unmarked van pulls up and slides the door open for him, he climbs inside. There is only a driver inside, wearing a military uniform of a different country, China. The driver without looking back asks him

""Well done. I couldn't see the operation but I assumed you got caught when communications went down. Did you get the package?""

""Sure did! My wife is going to love it!""

The driver confused, turns around to see a man in the backseat, engrossed his cell phone making cute bird noises...

"[WP] You are being baptised. As you submerge, your consciousness witnesses in a quick flash, the big bang, the start of the universe, evolution...",Willhart007,"When I was about seven I went with a friend to a Catholic church, I have no clue why looking back with hindsight what attracted me to religion in general. I was not raised with it as a fundamental aspect in my life, in fact it has always been quite the opposite. A man from a childhood of hard labor and taking care of family as his foundation of purpose.

I started going with him every Sunday and learned as much as I could, I went home to tell my mother I wanted to be baptized. She was not upset but it did not make her happy either cause she had to tell my dad who complained about it for a good three hours before agreeing to it.

""I ain't paying for your silly little dress, that's coming out of your pocket junior.""

""Fuck you need Jesus for has Jesus ever fed you with his titty?""

""Is Jesus gonna' protect your idiot big brother in the shit when Sadaam bombs his own city?"" 

""You ask me your better off without it, Sundays just as much a working day as any day else? It's got 24 hrs, don't it? That's two days of a paycheck if you play your cards right.""

Eight beers later.

""Okay fine, I'll pay half of your silly little dress."" 

Hugs, happiness ensues.

Looking back on that Sunday still brings lighthearted memories which I try to analyze. Maybe I got baptized because of the lack of attention, a chance to take some kind of stage and get noticed. A part of me has always been like that when I think about it.

Fast forward to Father Duncan tilting my head back with my nose plugged and me staring at all the church people with a big shit eating grin on my face. Ronnie, my friend sitting in the front pew even made this odd snorting laugh that sounded exactly like a powerfully backed up fart. I felt light headed and partially delirious...maybe it was from the anxiety of trusting another person to make sure I don't drown.

I took a deep breath of air just before I submerged, which despite Father Duncan warning me not to my face did any'fucking'ways. I must have swallowed about two cups of water before I could react. Then everything went dark, and it was like I could hear things above the surface but they were in slow motion. 

Then whiteness, my entire field of vision was a pure white except for a barely noticeable thin black line. A shadow appeared on the thin blackline and reached down to touch it. And the line grew with a small ball appearing on it growing exponentially until the vast darkness was all I could see it stayed like this for what seemed like minutes.

Instantaneously small explosions like tiny fire crackers going off randomly in every spot of every color. It kind of looked like those daylight firecrackers made of really colorful dye powders if they got stuck in place after popping open. It was amazing, the closer one had more detail and I could see spirals and symmetry in how they moved and that's when I knew this was how it all negan. 

Then I was pulled from the water and coughed up about a cup of it and choked as Father Duncan patted my back which made me puke up my mother's goulash all in the baptismal waters. This caused the congregation to gasp and break out in fainted whispers. My eyes watering, robes covered in half digested macaroni chunks, still coughing with the shit eating grin on my face I gave my buddy Ronnie a smooth thumbs up. 

I felt bad leaving the mess for the church to clean up but they insisted they take care of it. On our way out some Gothic looking kid told me that was the coolest baptism he'd ever seen and gave me a high five. Seven year old me was on Cloud Nine, with the afterglow of limelight, and I swam in that shit. 

I felt I suddenly knew things others did not, that I was part of something only a select few got to be a part of. When my parent's took notice they cut me off from the church and it did not help when I started spouting shit about me seeing the universe begin after getting baptized.

They sent me to a therapist and I had to talk about my thoughts and feelings which consisted mostly of me seeing some kind of truth. The psychiatrist explained that when I was dipped beneath the water and sucked some in I briefly passed out and the shadow figure was Father Duncan and the dry fireworks effect was my conal receptors readjusting the light filtered by water that created a prism of color effect.

I was crushed. My ego was once more brought down to the child's level and I did not know what to think about it now. I explained all of this to a man in the doctor's waiting room the week after that. He told me not get discouraged with my own belief system, and that each and every person has their own variation or spin on things to help them make sense of it. He really cheered me up.

When the therapist called me in I used the stranger's own take to explain my feelings and she asked where I had been told that and panicked when I said there was a man in her waiting room. She told me she had no men as patients and that her only patients were children.        ",KANNABULL

"[WP] ""When we die, that's when we wake up""",aden_triver,"""Oh shit"" the last thing I said before the car coming towards me connected with my legs sending me into the air like a rag doll, I wasn't scared but I knew it was over. My life didn't flash before my eyes but then again I didn't have much of one to start with; alone 35 no particular skills or hobbies , steady job in an office and too much time spent on my couch, there is a brief moment of pain as my head hits the concrete then nothing..

Suddenly theres a bright light...A slow buzz slowly starts to make sense, someone is speaking. 

"" Charlie? Can you hear me? "" a tall man dressed in white stands before me "" My name is Greg sorry for waking you so abruptly. We need to talk."" 

Looking around I see other people in white sitting at computers , "" Is this heaven?"" I ask as my hand reaches up to check my head, no lumps or blood it seems fine? 

"" No, Sorry I should explain, you have been in an induced coma for the last five years."" Greg started to explain, "" it will take some time for your memory to return but in brief you had instructed us to wake you only if Sara had been found"". 
""I've been in a coma since the accident?"" I choke out.
"" No sir the accident never happened I just had to wake you, it seems your memory may have been affected quite a bit more than we hoped, Sara is in the next room perhaps she can help you remember.""

I follow Greg through the door into a smaller room where a woman sits alone at a table her hands cuffed and a gun in front of her, Greg motions for me to take a seat.

""Hello Charles"" the girl snarls "" hope you're happy you piece of shit you've ruined the whole country.""
Greg strikes her hard across the jaw before she says another word, before I know it I've grabbed the gun cocked it and shot Greg square between the eyes, he drops limp to the ground blood pouring through his hair. Suprised at my own agility I drop the gun and sit down , surely the men in the next room heard and will come after me. Nothing happens.

Sara laughs hysterically "" The rumours must be true, are you addicted to your own shit? The king of Vir2 a common junky like the rest of your clients. "" 
I pick up the gun and point to Sara "" you need to tell me whats going on, quickly""
"" OK"" she loses some of her confidence shaken by what she's just seen ""you're the biggest kingpin in the US, you've invented a drug when combined with some cheap VR gear allows people to live totally seperate virtual lives in which everything is real to them, I'm the one who has been taking out your goons and destroying deliveries of your shit,"" she braces herself here obviously expecting me to hit her, or shoot her. 

It starts to come back to me "" This stuff has brought the country to a halt"" I mumble "" fathers have killed their families in order to be left alone to trip, to start again, people have been kidnapped and sold to fund the habit, your brother killed your mother and locked himself inside his VR tube where he overdosed"" its flowing back now , Sara was my best friend before this started, she wanted to use Vir2 to help train surgeons and further research, I wanted to make money, and I did, I was blinded by greed never satisfied always disapointed in what I had done. In the end I just wanted everything to go back to normal, normal is good.

""So when are you going to kill me?"" She snaps me from my day dream. I drop to the ground quickly and reach into Greg's pockets , find the key to her cuffs and free her. "" Stay here for a second,please"" I grab the gun and make my way to the backroom with the other men, three quick bangs and they drop. I go to one of the PC and arrange for all my stock, properties, cash, everything to be signed over to Sara Sigurski without question. 


I go back to where she is sitting , she looks at me and the last bit of hatred leaves her, she knows its over, she has won.
""All I wanted was a normal life but I had fucked things up too much to ever go back Sara, its all my fault but you can fix it. Its all yours, everything I own, do what you have too, sell what you have to, you can wake up the world."" 

Theres a brief moment of pain as the bullet breaches my skull then nothing...

I know, I used to stay up all night, playing video games, reading stories, sometimes even writing, then, when I glanced at the clock, realizing it was 4 in the morning, said to myself that I wouldn't go to school next day, I was sick anyway... Well, those days are long gone. I'm older now, and employed. School wasn't really important, I already had everything I needed to pass and everything I needed for life. But now, I must concentrate. This is probably the most important meeting of my life, and I can't fall asleep. Why is night at noon? Or has noon moved to the middle of the night? What has happened to time, the normal flow of the day? At night, I cannot fall asleep. Sunset used to be dawn, dusk, the most beautiful rays of morning light. I'm wide awake, writing my journal, knowing that when the morning comes, I'll be a half-dead husk of bitterness and sleep deprivation. I don't understand any of this, but I want it to end. I want my days to go back to the way they used to be. Or maybe I'll get used to it. I can get used to everything. Not only days, even years turning upside down, I can take that.

Opening it to the next free page, I began to do maths, plotting my numbers as graphs. We were a small community, and a safe one. But there were things we lacked. Heaters. A proper source of renewable electricity. Entertainment. There was so much we had to gain from other people, and by setting up our school as a market, we could attract groups from all over the country. But we would need more guards. We would probably need a currency. One that couldn't easily be faked. We would need to spread the word somehow. We would need to produce more goods ourselves. How many people should we expect a month? What rules should we apply. How would this change our current socialist society. So many questions to answer.

""How's your work?"" His face turned as he studied my messy notes. He was smarter than most gave him credit for, and he was always ready to point out flaws in my plans. 

""It's going well. There's still a fair bit to do, but I think we can be ready to open our gates within the month."" His eyebrows raised. 

""So soon? I thought it would be a while."" 

""I hope so anyway, it really depends on if we can produce an uncopiable currency."" 

He sat on my desk, pushing my empty bowl to the side. ""We could cut squares of metal from the large sheets in the metal-work room, and hammer a basic symbol into it?"" 

""Easy to copy. Anyone could mass produce their own."" 

""Condoms?"" 

I laughed, leaning back in my swivel chair, but he remained serious. ""No one would take it seriously."" 

He shrugged, idly playing with my fountain pen. ""No one can make new ones, they're limited, and have real world value."" 

He was right. The more I thought about it, the more it seemed like a good idea. I'd need to check how many we had in our stockroom, but it was a valid idea. ""What time are you leaving home tomorrow, Derrick?"" 

He put down my pen. ""Not late. We are pretty stable on resources, so we will be going scouting for other groups."" He pulled a folded piece of paper from his thick jeans, and unfolded it on the table. The map it showed was the state, with a bunch of lines and small noted scrawled on by Derrick. ""Each red circle is a group. Bigger the circle, the more land they tend to occupy."" 

The map had a curiously large empty spot to the east. Derrick pointed exactly where my eyes rested. ""We will go out there, see if anyone lives around there. Just a scouting mission, so I'll only take Jake. Maybe Emma as well. The others can have the day off, unless you need them for something else."" 

I absentmindedly chewed a nail as I thought. ""Thanks Derrick, but I shouldn't need them."" 

---

The next morning, I woke early. I had a fair bit to do today. I started by walking to the canteen, just as the Hunters were leaving, no doubt to start their shifts for the day. The young girl I'd seen skinning a kangaroo the day before, Shannon, was starting to clean the kitchen, not expecting anyone for the next hour or two. She smiled at me as I entered the canteen, leaving her sponge in the sink to slide a plate of fried egg and toast across the counter separating the canteen from the kitchen. I picked up the toast, and pushed the plate back, thanking her for the meal. truth be told, she tended to overcook eggs, but I couldn't complain, she was better than I. 

I walked through the courtyard, passing a woman mending a hole in a pair of pants. I nodded to her as I walked, heading for the storeroom. The storeroom was a few classrooms, which held our resources. It was under lock and key, lest someone sneak in at night, but it probably wasn't necessary, no-one had ever stolen anything before. 

Andy sat at a small desk, cataloging the resources brought in by the scavengers the day before, and crossing items off a long list. I stood by his desk, admiring the shelves full of goods, waiting for his attention. 

It was a good two minutes before he finally looked up. ""Hey Simon. What can I do you for?"" 

""I need to know how the amount of our condoms, soap, bottled water, canned food, mattresses, and homemade gunpowder."" 

""Odd list."" He mentioned, frowning as he fiddled with his notebook. ""Any reason in particular you want to know?"" 

""Just checking. Wouldn't want to be low on anything important."" 

""Okay. total 362 individual condoms. Total 37 bars soap, 52 liters liquid soap. Total 6 water tanks full, fourth half full. Total 550 cans of food. Total 12 mattresses. Total three kilograms homemade gunpowder.""

""Thanks Andy."" 

""No worries. Hey, could you give this to Derrick, we are running low on a few things, if he could keep an eye out, that'd be great."" 

I smiled, nodding my head, before turning to leave. 362 condoms were probably not enough to start a currency. If Derrick could do some trading with nearby friendly groups, we could possibly gain a lot more, even if we had to trade at a loss. It would be worth it in the end. I walked through the courtyard, heading towards the field, when a yell got my attention. I turned to the guard on the roof, as he began to whack his metal pole against the roof. One ring, Be on alert. Two rings, danger. Three rings, immediate danger. ",Razarip

[WP] You actually survived the Apocalypse.... The zombies are gone and you're part of a small self-sufficient community. The only question left is... now what?,iZakTheOnly,"It was the sort of thing that being prepared for actually worked. The basement of the parish was stocked with enough supplies to keep the 85 or so of them fed until things had blown over. At this point, it was all about re-constitution.

Pastor James, at 34, was easily the youngest man left alive. He had proven his ability to lead more than just from the pulpit, and now that the remains of the town were thriving, it was clear that he had established himself as the de facto mayor of what was left of the village of Briarwood. 

He sat in the pickup truck next to George Westphal, one of his most vocal supporters, a man that, at 62 years old put more effort into setting up the clean water and supplies than many of the younger men. 

""Looks like there should be plenty of supplies over in Shelbyville. I think they got hit a lot harder at the onset.""

""We can only hope."" James replied, surveying the landscape, now full of hordes of rotting corpses.

""I wanted to talk to you about something important, pastor.""

""What do you need George?""

George cleared his throat. He knew what he was about to say was going to be a difficult sell.

""We need to talk to you about the survival of humanity."" 

""What do you mean, George? I think we weathered the storm. I think humanity is safe, now.""

""I'm not talking about safety, padre. I'm talking about re-population. I'm not ready to claim I'm not capable of performing as a man, but on the same token, I don't think it's appropriate for me to try and act as husband to one of these young ladies that have no one to take care of them."" 

George's companion became rigid and his face turned several shades whiter than normal. As it stood currently, there were seven un-married women between 18-40 that were capable of bearing children. 

""What are you getting at, George?""

""I know you've taken a vow of celibacy, father. Well, things are a bit different now. I'd say, it's a good chance you're gonna need to break your vow...for the good of mankind.""

[WP] You actually survived the Apocalypse.... The zombies are gone and you're part of a small self-sufficient community. The only question left is... now what?,iZakTheOnly,"I have never done a writing prompt, and I slammed this out in an hour or two, give it a read. I am NOT a good writer, but this is me dipping my toes in, honest feedback is much appreciated. 





Even though I am leader, I still do my share. That's why I was standing on the roof of the school, on Guard duty. The school was a ring of buildings, with a large courtyard in the middle. Perfect for our day to day activities. I was supposed to be looking out towards the suburbs, and hills behind them, but there was no point anymore, the zombies were gone. 

So instead, I put my attention to a girl, no older than fourteen, skinning a kangaroo, carefully cutting sections of meat, and placing them in garbage bags, before two boys, no older than 14, hauled them to the industrial freezer we hooked up in the canteen. If the hunters had caught kangaroo, it meant stew for our evening meal. I turned my head higher, to the football field, which was full of growing vegetables, and a few saplings. Being unfenced, like the rest of the school, the four farmers were closely watched, losing our vegetable farm would be devastating. There wasn't much to be nervous of now though, the last sign of danger had been weeks ago. Our group had grown to thirty five people recently. A good size. 

The sound of metal hitting metal grabbed my attention, and I turned away from the school, to see our scavenging group return. My closest friend, Derrick, led the group of six on foot, all of them laden with a heavy backpack. No doubt full of batteries, alcohol, medicine, and other useful goods. The group dragged their respective weapons along the ground as they walked, a mismatched theme song of theirs. I placed my crossbow on the roof, gave them a wave, and slid down a ladder, onto the ground. I unlatched the fence, opening it for the group. They had been scavenging since early morning, and were only returning now, late afternoon. Over the last six or seven months, they had taken everything of value from a wide area around us, and were now forced to search further. I smiled at my friend, and before he went to drop off his goods at the storage rooms, he told me what they had gathered, and the continued lack of zombies. it did not surprise me, we hadn't seen one for a while. 

My shift as a guard was over at 9:00pm. Everyone in our community has a job or two, and we do them in shifts. Scavengers do shifts out in the ""wild"", looking for goods, and shifts as guards. Farmers do shifts out on the field, growing crops, and keeping chickens. Hunters go out to the nearby nature reserve, hunting rabbits, fish, and gathering edible herbs and Witchetty grubs. Everyone else who stays at the school spend their time preparing meals, reinforcing or improving our defenses, practicing combat, pulling guard duty, or sorting and allocating resources, such as clothes, extra food, and batteries. My friend leads the scavengers, and I lead here, at home. Our base is a well-oiled machine, we have survived raids by other groups, zombie waves, and starvation. 

Now that my shift was over, I walked down to the canteen, to get a hot meal. With shifts ending at random times, the canteen was open until late, always a hot meal waiting for the tired worker. I received my bowl of stew, balancing a chunk of fresh bread on the rim. I thanked Chuck, our perpetually smiling chef, and left the canteen, leaving the booths for my room. 

Most slept one or two to a classroom, all of which were stripped, and decoration left to the new owners. The school equipment was used for fire wood and materials. Performing exceptionally at your job, for example a hunter bringing in two kangaroos in one day, would earn you a token. Tokens were exchanged in the supply room for extra clothes, candy, or better bedding. The school *did* have enough rooms for everyone to have their own room, but after a close call with a large wave of zombies a few months ago, half of the bottom floor classrooms had the unclean-able scent of rotting flesh, and the memories of death that accompanied. I was lucky, as leader, I was afforded my own room. I liked to keep things simple, with a mattress on the floor in a corner, and a large desk in the other. It made the large classroom seem sparse, but as paranoid as I am, the extra room makes it easier to fight in case of an emergency. But that was the last thing on my mind, as I sat at my desk, spooning hot stew into my mouth. Warmth spread through my body as I ate, washing away the chilly bite of the guard shift. it wasn't winter yet, but it was getting closer, and colder. ",Razarip

[WP] You actually survived the Apocalypse.... The zombies are gone and you're part of a small self-sufficient community. The only question left is... now what?,iZakTheOnly,"I listened as three rings sounded through the air, and sprinted towards the roof. Everyone in the courtyard scurried away, the weaker hiding in the reinforced storeroom, and the stronger gathering their weapons. 

I climbed the ladder, surveying the situation, as the guard waited for instruction. 25 people were advancing on the school, no further than 200 meters. All of them held a baseball bat, or a spear, a few held crossbows. I turned to the guard, Maria. ""Four scavengers stayed back today. Go find them, tell them to come on the roof, with their crossbows. Tell everyone else who is able to fight, to grab a weapon, but stay outside the storeroom. Then go to the metalwork room, and grab five shields. Bring them out to the courtyard, and leave them on the ground. Then get to the storeroom yourself. If they get through, we will need you to help protect the others. She nodded, and climbed down the ladder as fast as she could. 

I took a deep breath, and stood at the edge of the roof, facing our assailants. Maybe they were peaceful? I was ready to speak, but the man leading the group spoke first, his loud voice carrying well along the street. ""Tell your group to exit the school unarmed. We will spare all of you."" 

It's a little belief of mine, to never trust anyone to spare you, if they are holding a weapon, so I decided not to take him up on his offer. Instead, I turned around, getting ready to mount a defense. 

A homemade arrow whistled past my head, as one of them shot at me, and I dropped to my stomach. They had started attacking already. 

I saw the head of a scavenger appear at the top of the ladder, and I waved him up, motioned to stay down. All four lay next to me, holding their crossbows. Arrows flew above us, but we were a small enough target that they were not a problem. Instead, we aimed ourselves. 

""Fire."" One of the scavengers whispered, and I felt the crossbow vibrate a little in my arm, as the arrow flew towards the enemy. Of our five arrows, two hit. We sent three volleys, taking down their numbers to 18, before they arrived at our gate. I could hear as they attempted to hammer down the lock, and I climbed down the ladder, scavengers behind me. 

I would like to explain now, how we fought valiantly against the invaders, how I led the team to victory, all of us cheering as the last of them scrambled to escape us. But in reality, as soon as they burst through, I took a spear to the shoulder, and passed out. 
---

When I woke up, I was lying in our hospital, the schools infirmity. My vision was blurred, and I felt a dull pain in my shoulder. Painkillers at work, most likely. I opened my dry mouth, working my jaw in circles. ""How long have I been out?"" I asked, hoping someone was nearby. 

""Two days. Nasty wound. It's not infected, but it's going to take a while to heal."" 

I turned my head towards the noise, meeting eyes with our resident Doctor. ""What happened?""

She sighed. ""They injured you, and killed two of the others. Maria led everyone in a charge, outnumbering them."" 

I felt terrible. The pain in my shoulder was nothing to the pain that two the people I was supposed to lead had been killed, because of me. I forced the emotion down, taking deep breaths. 

""Can I leave?"" I asked hopefully.

""One week."" 

---

A week passed, and I was soon on my feet. Arm in a sling, I was able to leave the ""hospital"". Derrick had overseen the reinforcement of the gate, replacing the lock we had used to defend from zombies, with a metal crossbar. I talked to him about the attack, there were no enemy survivors. 

As I walked to my room, thoughts kept tugging at me. Houses no longer held ample resources. Preserved food was harder to find. Anyone who did not have a renewable source of food, like us, was going to be forced to attack other groups for supplies. Groups would be getting more violent in the future. My idea of an open market to trade goods and services might prevent this, presenting another option for supplies. I needed to knuckle down. Zombies may be gone, but humans are the enemy now.

That's what the lone billboard in the city had been painted over with. It had been not a year after Z-day, the end of days. I had lost everything; everyone. I felt guilty. Why had I been spared? I was no better than the rest of the population, my family, my neighbors. There was no warning. No time to say goodbye. No time to run. No time to scream. But that's the past now.

Standing on the corner of what's left of my city, our city, I look to the sky. The purple glow of the toxicity in the atmosphere provides an illusion of calm. I can't stay out here much longer. Before I can look back at the ground, the bus pulls up. Survivors sit in silence as I take a seat near the front. we drive out towards the mine pit South of the city. We live deep underground to avoid the unknown all around us. The unknown is all we know. We get through the perimeter gate and begin descending in to the earth. The darkness is no longer frightening. Surviving is no longer frightening, it's all we have left.

We enter the underground complex and begin decontamination. Once cleared, I walk back to my dorm. There are only 100 of us here, each sharing a room with one individual. I collect my rations and save what I can. The progress we have made is miniscule compared to civilization not a year ago. I fear we are the last of us. I cannot let that stop me from trying. I lay down and close my eyes, dreaming of the future that I will not see. I can only put it in motion. I can only rebuild.",Top_Nodder

Day 479 after outbreak. 
Justice Jose's Leaders Journal for June and Heath.   
Confirmation today from three more scouting teams, that each went about three hundred miles out east, west, and north. They were finally fully dead or dying. That sentence would've looked funny to anyone reading it two years ago wouldn't it? Guess it goes as the world has gone. The ""Zombies"" (though I really prefer the re-animated, or stumblers) had started appearing over a year and a half ago, and the epidemic had consumed the globe shortly after. I have lost all those I love, accept you my two children. No you I protected with my life and even the lives of others at times when needed. The sins I have committed in surviving this unholy onslaught of death and destruction, well let's just say I don't expect to wake up at the pearly gates when I close my eyes the last time. However all of it, and I do mean all of it, was well worth the price to get you, June and Heath to the other side alive and mostly whole. As I look out over our city of rebirth I think back at how we made it. We started this community seemingly so long ago as a camp of refugees and survivors from surrounding towns and city's. Person by person, skill by skill, job by job, we built little by little. First stable shelters, then defensible walls, then power generation, then farming, and so on. Through it all I had become first leader by necessity, then elected protector of the people. Some one suggested the title Judge, and so that's what I became. Some lives were sacrificed along the way, they had to be in order to keep going. Sometimes it was turning out people who just weren't fitting in the community, and we had to get out to keep the community whole. Sometimes it was darker and had to be done by someone, well that someone was me with a title.
You see my children as you read this, I want you to understand what happened and why. I don't excuse my actions and sins, I accept them fully and whole heartily. I know you will see some of my transgressions as monstrous and even evil on some level. If you do see that, then I succeeded even more in keeping your safe not just from the ""Eaters"" and ""Rotties"" but from the hard truths about our own nature that was brought out during this time. As I have accounted in previous pages, and will continue to account through the few months I plan to continue this journal. Many things happened in the community that most of our now thirteen hundred residents never knew, and god help us will never know. Like what we did with the Blaton family, oh children how I wish I could keep this from your eyes. The Blatons were not in fact the victims in a lapse in our perimeter as we reported  to everyone, the knights of rebirth and I. No, you see we killed them children, all twenty members of the Blatons died by our hands. The knights had found a horrific scene near the mines around our little rebirth (Little at that time), bones. Now I know what you are thinking, so what there are bones EVERYWHERE around the world dad!!! Two thirds of the worlds population up until very recently had either died, or died and decided to walk around for tasty human appetizers afterwards. The fact that too this day no scientist can still give a reason as to why it happened is still both baffling and infuriating......
Oh, apologies for my ramblings my children. So the knights found bones near the mines, freshly buried and put where others weren't meant to find. Anyone other than our Knight scouts would've missed it, but our guys are the best and you know that. They brought it too my attention and through some investigation we made a horrid discovery. The Blatons had all become cannibals by choice. This was right around harvest time, and there wasn't a shortage of food available, plus their farm alone brought in two hundred baskets of corn. We even had a good sized pig and goat heard to provide meat. You see they apparently, somewhere along the way before they had come to us, had gained a taste for human flesh. Now I will give them this credit, they never ate anyone that we know of from rebirth. I still think this was more to do with not raising suspicion in their own community than any real concern for their neighbors. They apparently preferred to lure in survivors from nearby into crude traps and eat them. However, when we did finally get to the bottom of everything, we found that they alone had killed and consumed over two hundred. A decision had to be made, one that no one would've wanted to discuss in the open town hall. One that no one wanted to really even make. However, the town looked to me for protection, and this fell under that category.  I knew the Blatons could never really integrate back into any real society. So a band of our fiercest Knights and I went out to the Blaton farm and cleaned up. Yes, I am going to leave that as callous as it sounds my children, for you need to understand what we were facing while we built our thriving Rebirth. Now up until this point you have had no idea what this whole ""Leaders"" journal was about. Just that you needed to keep it to yourselves until you finished. Well my loves, as you know by reading this far I have openly judged and privately judged many matters. Unfortunately along the way I also lost the ability to be part of a true civilized Rebirth society. As you no doubt are aware by this point, I have left you. This was a long thought out hard decision to make I assure you. However as we closer and even into the end of this terrible event that will mar the history of mankind for centuries to come. It has become abundantly clear that men like me have no place in a new world. Sure we were needed while all the bad things went down to get the people through the night. Now however, well now we need to go away and die out in our own way. By the time you get this it will be two months from the above date, and the Knights and Myself will have all left Rebirth. You will also at the completion of this course of thoughts on leadership be appointed Judge June, and Judge Heath. You will rule Defense and Agriculture together as brother and sister and lead our people into prosperous times. Already plans are made to merge many of the closer settlements into Rebirth. The city will become a beacon of hope and life in the midst of so much death and sadness. As for Myself and the Knights, well we have a different path. We have made contact with several like minded Individuals, and we will spend the rest of our days cleansing this land. Cleansing it of threats like the Baltons, or bandits, murderer's, thieves, and the list goes on. We will go till our last breath making sure that our children, and children's children can actually have another chance. I love you both so very much. ",Tigerclaw437

Location Pearl remains at threat-level blue, and openings Ruby and Sapphire are at level yellow. Operations Setting Sun and Rising Moon are about to commence, and Agent Oak will brief you upon their conclusion. As for Agent Ivy--""

""Don't mention that name!"" President Trump yelled into the phone.

""My apologies, Mr. President. Agent Oak is in constant contact with Command Center. Is there anything else you need?""

""No, that'll be all, Admiral. Be ready to brief the next President once she takes office.""

""Yes, sir, Mr. President. And may I say, thank you for making America great again."" President Trump smiled.

""Thank you, Admiral, for your invaluable help in making it happen."" He hung up the phone and opened the top left drawer of the desk. Written in his impeccable handwriting was the results of billions of dollars of secret funds and hush-hush military operations. Would his replacement believe a word of it?

As she stood on the stage, reciting the oath for the Chief Justice and the millions crowding the National Mall, President Trump hoped that she did. She would have to. For what seemed like the millionth time over the last few weeks, Former-President Trump considered financing the program himself. It could easily bankrupt even him, But it'd be worth it just to save America from those creatures with their horrifying powers and abilities. Just as the new President finished her oath of office, he felt a tap on his shoulder. It was Agent Oak.

""Sir,"" he whispered into Trump's ear, ""Sun and Moon were successful. We lost hundreds of men, however. But we did collect 151 unique specimens before we sealed the rifts."" Former-President Trump nodded softly, trying to avoid attention at this extremely public event being watched around the globe.

""That's good. It's all over, then?""

""Not exactly, sir."" Former-President Trump turned in his seat.

""What do you mean, '*not exactly*'?"" he hissed.

""It seems Agent Ivy--""

""Don't mention that name!"" Former-President Trump growled.

""Right. It seems... 'she'... made it back through the rift. And from what she's reported, there are hundreds more types oft these creatures. Some of them even more powerful then the ones we've seen."" Former-President Trump sighed.

""It seems I only have one choice,"" he said as he turned his MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN ballcap around on his head. ""Call my accountants, my finance guys, tell them to prepare my holdings for Operation XY.""

""Sir,"" Agent Oak said as he reached into his satchel, ""I believe you actually have three choices.""",miles_allan
[WP] A Portuguese voyage of discovery exploring a way around Africa unexpectedly encountered their Chinese counterpart in a yet uncharted African coast. You are a Captain of one of the vessels (either Chinese or Portuguese) recounting the event in your memoirs.,mygoodnight,"Dear Alphonso de Cunha

May you live in peace and contentment. Though with no pride I do report that the Kingdom of Preston John will continue to elude us, I am pleased to tell you of a most interesting shipwreck we have discovered not far from the mouth of the Rio Rovuma on the eastern coast of this African continent. We had hoped that this region might be the location of the lost Christian Kingdom, as many stories have reached us from the locals of a race of pale bearded men who sailed these waters in great ships, not longer than a few generations ago. Men, we surmised, must surely be like us, but this perhaps not the case.

One elder spoke of one of these ships, and how it had beached gracefully on a stretch of white sands not far north of the river, which his people regard to be a cursed site. Seeing the wreck myself, it was not so hard to believe. The men tarried, but I reminded them that they were men of god, and that no pagan magicks would harm those with true faith. With that and our chaplains blessing, we approached the wreck, and it was truly a sight to behold. It was both beautifully ornate and terrible as sin at once, carved with the image of foul serpents and strangely headed lions. The ship was constructed of a fine softwood, very high decked and box like in design. The sails, eaten away by age, looked ghastly and as the bony fingers of dead men. It would seem their sails were ribbed in some faishon, though in what shape and in what arrangement I can only wonder. How such a ship moved, let alone sail the open sea, is a true mystery.

The interior of the ship consisted of many compartments, treacherous to navigate through and very dark. We found no crew aboard, alive or dead, and this did little to calm the nerves of the men sent in. We found a great many scrolls inscribed with arcane writings, as well as the bronze idols of what must be their ungodly religion. Most importantly we found a good many stones of silver ingots, and a good many spices, well sealed in strange pots carried here from foreign lands. We scoured the ship completely over four days and nights, accumulating a great fortune in loot, a half portion of which you will receive as per our contract. In all, I suspect the loot to be valued at 60 ducats, which should easily offset the cost of expedition and any loss of prestige from failing our initial quest.

Whoever the men built this were, they are from a far off land, beyond even this ocean, but they are certainly not Christian, and they could not have hailed from the realm of Preston John. We will have to keep looking, and should we discover the builders of this ship in our search, we might be able to secure a trade of spices with them, and we can bring the light of Christ into their hearts that they so desperately lack.

But he did.

When he told his adjuncts and fellow professors where he was moving, each and every one of them responded with an expression of disbelief - a laugh, a gasp, a mystified shake of the head. Aiden Ungerton, the Departmental Head of Physics, posited that perhaps, at long last, Pole's vast intellect had proven *too heavy* for the stringy old man, and had buried him in a self-destructive bout of insanity.

Yet, when Professor Pole hopped off the train, a tiny suitcase rolling behind him, there was a whistle on his lips, and an unusual energy to his step.

He arrived in Podunk, Oklahoma, where not a single person knew his name, his legacy, nor much of anything regarding the modern scientific advances of the last five hundred years. It was a dream *come true*. He bought a barn, a peaceful retreat where his gadgetry and testing apparati could sprawl and be tinkered on in peace. Not to mention the rent was about one fifth what he paid for his dusty, cramped apartment.

The simpleton who hauled his equipment, his instruments and devices and other gizmos, was a giant, friendly boy - about the age of the students he had taught at EANE University. The simpleton, Job, or James, or some such folksy name, was a curious fellow and after he spent many, many sweaty hours hauling in Professor Pole's precious items, Jack (or Jonathan) began to prod.

They were in the barn, surrounded by scattered tools and chunks of machinery. Lou had his finger pressed to his lips, trying to *envision* where his appliances should fit, when the simpleton's deep voice rolled down from the rafters:

""Is this a laser gun?"" Jacob held out a device, vaguely shaped like a hand-held firearm.

Lou was about to snap at the boy for the umpteenth time to *put that down! Don't you know what fragile means?* Instead, he raised his eyebrows in surprise - this time, the boy was close with his guess, ""No, that is a Lidar Gun."" 

The last item the simpleton picked up, he guessed was a tiny teleportation device. How the boy even knew the word teleportation was a bottomless mystery. It, Lou had to explain, was actually a hotplate, and that the boy should *put it down, now, please.*

""A Lidar gun?"" the boy tried out the words, ""Kind of bullets does it use?""

""It is *not* a weapon,"" Lou said, ""It's used to measure the speed of certain objects.""

""Oh,"" the boy said, his enthusiasm sapped by the mundanity of the Lidar Gun. He tossed it over his shoulder with a shrug. Lou cringed with every clattering bump. 

""Joseph,"" Lou hissed through his teeth, ""I think I've had enough help for today, thank-""

""What's this?"" Joseph (?) yanked something out of a crate - metal and plastic and mirrors and wires accordioned out of the crate, and slipped out of his hands.

Lou heard the dull 'oops' in the very instant before the one end of the contraption crashed to the ground. His heart stopped. He turned around, expecting to see one of his priceless microscopes or particle beacons split to tiny, irreparable pieces.

A sigh of relief blew through his lips - it was only that infernal ""portable Rube Goldberg"" gimmick Professor Englebert bought him as a going-away gift. In fact, Lou did not recall ever packing the device, yet now the useless, space-filling trinket, was spilling down from the loft like one of those children's matchbox car tracks. 

""That is ..."" Lou couldn't think of a way to explain it to the boy. He made a 'why not' face, more to himself than to the simpleton, and said, ""That is yours. You can have it.""

The boy's eyes lit up brighter than a solar array, ""No way!""

His use of the colloquial phrase confused Lou. *Did that mean no, as in no thank you? No way as in he couldn't possibly? No* comma *way, as in-*

While Lou was sussing out this latest puzzle, John (or was it Jason) had disappeared in the loft again. He came back out, holding a very, *very* fragile grape-shaped object - a clear prism that Lou had specially made for one of his failed projects. 

The production of that grape cost more than a full-ride through EANE University. 

So when Lou sucked in his breath, he had every intention of screaming at the boy to *put that down RIGHT NOW PLEASE*. Instead, he choked, and made an embarassing *gleep* sound.

The boy slotted the grape through a hole in the Rube-Goldberg device - and it began its decent. The boy procured a vaguely firearm-shaped item from the deep pockets of his blue jeans, and pointed it at the grape as it clanked and clinked and clacked it's way down the Rube-Goldberg track.

*Click. Clack*

Each hit was a needle-prick to Professor Pole's pumping heart. 

*Clack Clickclack crack clack*.

He watched as it fell all the way to the bottom, only to touch that last, spring-loaded lever and *zip* right back to the beginning. 

""Whoa..."" the boy said, not bothering to close his jaw. The Lidar gun fell to his side.

*Clickclickcliclckaclclkcackaclkaclkaclakc*-

The grape fell faster this time. The loop was completed in about half the previous time, and showed no signs of slowing.

A realization shuttered through Professor Pole's mind - a blink of a thought, a rejection, the thought reinforced, denial, the thought backed up by visual evidence, and so on. It took several iterations for his brain to accept that maybe, just maybe, this was the beginning of an impossible hypothesis. 

*ClkClkClkClkCkCkCkCkkkkkk*-

*Not. Possible.* That's what this was. *Not. Possible.*

He, Professor Lou Pole, was witnessing the first *ever* infinite loop. No loss of energy. In fact, quite the opposite.

Professor Pole's eyes glassed over, his mouth hung open; a perfect mirror of the Simpleton boy.

“It’s coffee, there is some more in the kitchen.”

“I can see that it’s coffee, but why is it floating in the middle of the garage?”

Marsha was always asking silly questions. “It got stuck there earlier today and I haven’t the time to fix it.”

“Honey, this seems like an important discovery.”

“Not now Marsha, I’m going to set off my latest contraption. Place this unassuming superball into the start of the track right there and watch.” 

Marsha placed the ball on what appeared to be the stolen remnants of her sons stolen hot wheels track. The ball eventually knocked over a set of dominoes which pushed a toy truck into a pool ball. After a large amount of things were pushed over by a large amount of other things a small ball fell into a funnel. Marsha expect for the ball to come out of the other end of the funnel but instead it teleported a few feet above the coffee mug. The ball fell into the coffee creating a big splash. 

“No, not again.” 

“Why are you upset? You just discovered teleportation. This is a brilliant discovery.” 

It seemed Marsha wasn’t getting the big picture. “I suppose that’s nice and all but that’s not the point here. I held it in my hand Marsha. It was right here.”

“What was here?”

“Infinite energy. Just think about how much lower our energy bill would be. I was making a device to create the perfect breakfast, but it turned out to be a perpetual energy engine. That was until Rufus ran across my machine to get to the precious bacon at the end. That’s it bacon. I nixed the bacon to prevent another Rufus incident but maybe that was the key all along.”

“John, I’m pretty sure the answer to the world energy crisis does not rely on bacon. If anything don’t you think you should focus on the discovery you have made.”

""Look, Doc, it's still doing the thing that made you get all,"" the Simpleton flapped his arms in a cheap imitation of Lou's *very well deserved* excitement. 

Turns out the Simpleton's name was Kacey. No J at all. 

Good God, what kind of person names their son Kacey?

""Kacey,"" the Prof's voice was creaky with frustration, ""How many times do I have to tell you, I am *not* a Doctor. I am a Professor of Physics, with several philosophical doctorates. There is a difference, you see.""

Professor Pole pushed gestured with his hands, pushing at the air as if he could force knowledge (or at least a mote of common sense) into the boy's mind.

""Several ... doctors?"" Kacey said. Lou could almost hear the gears churning in his head, ""So, I gotta call you... *Docs*?""

Professor Pole lifted his eyes to the rafters, muttering to the divinities that might be, more out of convenience than belief. A hitching sound - *zzztak - zzztak* - came from the Rube-Goldberg/Infinite Energy machine. The Grape was a blurred line now, you could see it's path down the track, but not the Grape itself.

It showed no signs of stopping.

""Kacey, bring me my phone please.""

An image flashed through his mind - a half-hour search through the piles of gadgets and gizmos, cracked screens and scopes, shattered glass everywhere. The end result: a simple-minded boy, asking ""Is this it? What about this one?"" and promptly tossing *another* very expensive piece of equipment over his shoulder to crash among the other broken things.

""Wait, never mind, I'll go get it. You, stay right where you are. *Don't touch a thing*.""

Pockets. Nope. 

Luggage. Nope.

Car. There it is. Beep beep boop. Ring. Ring. Come on. Rinnn-click.

*""Hello?""*

""Englebert,"" he whispered, his legs carrying him automatically to the barn door, half ajar. He wasn't sure why he was whispering, but it seemed like appropriate given the gravity of his discovery, ""Englebert, can you hear me?""

*""Hey, Lou! Did you get find my little package?""* *Chuckle chuckle.*

""Englebert!"" Professor Pole hissed, ""Did you see it? Did you see what that thing did?""

Something hummed in the air next to his ear. Both ears. Lots of insects in Oklahoma. Good thing he'd be staying inside most of the time. 

*""Lou, it's a Rube-Goldberg machine. It's not magic or any-""

""No! Did you *see?* The loop - the loop is infinite - no loss of energy - it goes on and on -""

*""Okay, calm down there Cowboy. You get some heat stroke? I told you to hire a mover-""*

""Listen,"" Professor Pole squeaked, ""Listen to me! Do you remember that orbicular prism I had made last year?""

*""For the acceleration project, right?""*

""It dropped in. The machine - it threw it back. It *increased its* speed.""

Buzzzzzzzzzz. Lou looked around, trying to find whatever giant insect was making that sound. All he saw were swaying trees and the barn. Shadows moved inside, just beyond the barn door. He picked up his pace.

*""Lou, I don't understand, what are you saying?""

""Infinite. Energy. The Law has been *broken.*""

*""Lou,""* Englebert said, just as Professor Pole placed his hand on the door, *""You can't break the laws. I don't know what you* think  *you saw, but it wasn't a broken law.""*

But Lou was not listening. He had pushed open the door, and the source of the buzzing was revealed: inside, the Simpleton had stacked a few appliances that *definitely should not have been stacked* on top of each other. The appliances - one a machine washer-sized particle accelerator, the other a magnetic field emitter that looked like an old record player, were also plugged into an experimental generator. All three were sharing the same power strip.

Bolts and screws and light plastic and packaging peanuts were drifting in mid air, either bouncing softly against the ceiling, or bobbing like metal fish in an aquarium.

His tone was no where near subtle, he was taking delight in the challenge of dealing with so many good hearted heroes.

Every other villain had whatever weapon they had ready to break through the walls of the complex and take every civilian hostage. It wasn't long before all sorts of magic and scientifically questionable machines had broken down the walls, and the people using them had taken the shop owners, and the everyday shopper hostage.

The dumbfounded super villains were looking at the largest collection of superheroes they had ever seen. And as Doctor Flamo nervously let out a small cascade of magma, every one of them turned to face the nervous arrivals. People gasped and all noise abandoned the room. 

The silence was palpable for a moment, broken only by the sound of the Death Priest praying for mercy. The heroes began to whisper, no doubt discussing how they were going to rip these super villains limb from limb once and for all. A small woman at what looked like a sign-in desk glared coldly at them. A stage was set up where a man with a microphone stood looking confused. 

The woman at the desk spoke up: ""Did you bring any tickets? You know you were supposed to come as super heroes, right?""

Metal-Muncher huddled the group together and whispered to the other villains, ""It must be some kind of code word.""

They began to discuss their response. Maybe they could talk their way out of this... 

It wasn't an option. Besides, Bolt-Action hated talk. With a burst of red light, he reduced the woman at the desk to a small pile of smoldering ashes. 

As the super villains ran terrified from the building like teenagers ringing a doorbell, the audience concluded that it must have been special effects. They burst into applause at the amazing acting.

As part of the Quality Assurance team you have to hunt down the defective ones before danger befalls the unwitting victim's.,scribbles33,"The case of Jessica Samser was something far different than any other case in the Quality Assurance Program. Something far worse than a demon came through that night: the devil himself. A normal Quality Assurance Team consists of two priests. And, with no knowledge of the dark lord being in that bedroom, only the two priests were sent; and were quickly dispatched. The devil possessed Jessica and made her kill her own family, before running off into the night. For the next forty years, tales and legends were told of her; saying she joined a Satanist cult and practiced dark magic. And then she vanished again, presumed dead. But on the night of April 9th 2007 Jessica Samser returned. 

You never know when an incursion is going to happen. It just happens. Most nights are quiet, nothing out of the ordinary. And then before you know it, blaring alarms turn on and people are rushing around. The 9th of April was one of the rare nights when an incursion did happen. Two young but experienced priests, Anthony Adams and Viktor Karuski were this case’s Quality Assurance Team; as far as they knew it was just another monster. The drive from the church to the incursion site was twenty three minutes, forty three seconds. Anthony and Viktor set off in Viktor’s old Chevy Impala 1967, “a classic car for a classic man” his girlfriend, Stacy, used to say. Viktor was strong and well-built, with chiselled cheek bones and a buzz cut; not your usual priest. He was the jock, the popular kid at school. But he always took an interest in becoming a priest, his passion for God was strong which made him the perfect candidate for the Quality Assurance Program. Anthony was born into a strict Christian family. He was never allowed to play with the other children when he was younger, and spent most of his younger life in isolation. He doesn’t particularly enjoy being a priest, always complaining saying that he wished he could be different; but he can’t deny the fact that however harsh his mother and father were on him, it moulded him into a good priest and all round a good person. 
“So you ever gonna come round for dinner Tony?” asked Viktor. 
“I told you, I will, I’m just busy.” Replied Anthony.
“Yeah well, Stacy’s getting paranoid. She thinks you don’t like her.”
“What? I’ve never even met her, how can I already have an opinion of her?” said Anthony, rather taken aback. 
“The thing is, we hardly ever have guests. At least ones that I bring. It’s always her having her friends come for dinner, and I can’t really join in with the conversation. ‘Cos I’m not good with the talking thing, y’know.”
“Yeah, I really do know.” Added Anthony, and he began giggling.
“Watch it,” said Viktor who, however annoyed he was, couldn’t help but laugh a little. When they both stopped, he continued, “So she wants me to bring my friends, well… friend, over. Because trust me she is great with the talking thing, never shuts up”, Anthony smirked, “Look just come and meet her, it’ll… it’ll be a fun night.”
“I told you man, I will. I promise,” Anthony suddenly looked up, “we’re here.”

The house was just your average suburban home: two stories, detached with a garage. Nothing particularly out of the ordinary, except from the monster in the child’s bedroom. The two priests got out of their car and walked towards the house.
“Twenty bucks says it’s got tentacles.” Said Viktor.
“You’re on,” Replied Anthony. 
	Viktor picked the lock of the front door, quickly dashed in and disabled the alarms. He came back out to signal Anthony to come in. The house was pitch black, you literally couldn’t see anything except what the moonlight coming from the windows touched. The two priests only found the stairs when Anthony tripped over them. Viktor took out a torch, and they embarked upstairs. 
If a blanket doesn’t work and the monster enters the room, the child doesn’t have long before it is inevitably mauled. But then again, if the priests were to rush up the stairs the monster would hear them and kill them too. So priests are told to take things slow and be cautious; but when you’re there, knowing a young child’s life is in danger, the slowness is painful. Viktor and Anthony stood outside the bedroom door, Viktor brought out a radio/recorder and turned it on, “This is Viktor Karuski and Anthony Adams, we’re about to investigate a suspected incursion where apparently a blanket has malfunctioned and not warded off the dark entities correctly. Control, are you hearing me?” the device beeped, “Okay, we’re going to go in now.”
	Anthony and Viktor nodded at each other and, with a crucifix in hand, barged into the bedroom. It was in ruin. The bed was overturned on one side of the room; a wardrobe had collapsed and fallen apart; toys were strewn all across the floor. And in the middle was a little boy lying in foetal position. Anthony immediately ran up to him, “Tony wait!” said Viktor urgently. Anthony ignored him; he knelt down next to the boy, turned him over and saw that the boy was dead, with his throat slit. “Shit, he’s dead!” said Anthony, panting. 
“Tony, get down!” cried Viktor. Anthony looked up to see a hockey stick smack him in the face. Viktor tried to run over but some wooden boards were flung at him and he was knocked down. Anthony and Viktor got up, both were bruised, bleeding and out of breath. They turned around and saw the bed mysteriously floating, then it flew at great speed towards them. Both priests managed to duck in time.
“What is happening?” cried Anthony.
“This is no normal monster,” said Viktor. The house began to shake and the toys, broken bed and wardrobe pieces all started flying around the room.
“REVEAL YOURSELF!” Shouted Viktor. And everything became silent. The objects around the room stopped moving and the house stopped shaking. All that could be heard was a faint rasping sound. In front of where Viktor stood, strands of hair fell from the ceiling, the rasping got louder. Then a most horrendous face met, upside down, with Viktor’s. The face was old, wrinkly and green. With large gashes and horrible purple bruises. The face grinned with black teeth on grey, decayed, gums. “Oh my god” said Viktor. He recognized who this person was. Everyone knew her story. Crouched on the ceiling was Jessica Samser, the devil’s ‘bitch’. Jessica threw up thick, coagulated blood with yellow chunks onto Viktor’s face; he fell back in horror screaming, trying to wipe the gunk from his face. Jessica then vanished. “Holy shit, what the fuck’s happening?!” said Anthony, panicking.
“This isn’t a monster,” said Viktor, “nor a demon. It’s a witch.”
“So what do we do?”
“We have to perform an exorcism on the house,” Viktor got up and grabbed Anthony by the shoulders, “Tony, you’re ordained. You have to do it!”
“I don’t think I can,” he replied, stifling tears.
Viktor smiled, “of course you can. You just gotta believe.” Anthony smirked. Then he got up and pulled his bible out of his pocket, and a vial of holy water from another. Then Anthony frantically flicked through the pages of the bible until he found the right verses. “Okay,” he said, “I’ll try.” Anthony opened the vial and walked around the room, speaking bible verse in Latin and occasionally flicking holy water onto the walls, ceiling and floor. When the holy water touched the surface of the house, it boiled; and with every word Anthony spoke, cracks appeared in the houses foundations. Jessica reappeared with a knife in her hand. “Keep going!” said Viktor, “I’ll buy you time!” Anthony continued to read from the bible. He was progressively stuttering more and more, and began to sweat profusely. Viktor dived towards Jessica and flung her to the floor. He got on top of her and punched her several times. Then Jessica drove her knife into Viktor’s shoulder. He screamed in agony. Jessica once again vanished then swiftly reappeared with a lead pipe. She raised in and ran, screaming at Viktor. He fell and raised his hand in defence. The force in which Jessica brought down the pipe onto Viktor’s arm almost completely split his hand. Viktor writhed in pain, screaming and crying. He pulled the knife out of his shoulder with his good hand, got up, and sliced Jessica’s throat. But it was to no avail. Jessica reached deep inside the cut in her throat and pulled out lumps of rotten flesh and shoved them in her mouth. She began cackling. Anthony threw up. Jessica rushed towards Viktor and smashed his head in with the pipe, knocking him out. Then Anthony finished the Latin verses and Jessica quickly turned her head towards him, she had felt it. Jessica began wailing and writhing. Anthony then said, “In the Name of Jesus Christ, our God and Lord, strengthened by the intercession of the Immaculate Virgin Mary, Mother of God, of Blessed Michael the Archangel, of the Blessed Apostles Peter and Paul and all the Saints. And powerful in the holy authority of our ministry, we confidently undertake to repulse the attacks and deceits of the devil. God arises; His enemies are scattered and those who hate Him flee before Him. As smoke is driven away, so are they driven; as wax melts before the fire, so the wicked perish at the presence of God.” Jessica screamed, ran towards Anthony and drove the lead pipe into his left lung. He gasped as the air escaped the lung and it collapsed, and in turn he fell to the floor. Jessica began haemorrhaging, blood spurted from everywhere. The exorcism was working, but was not complete. With the last of his energy, Anthony got up on his knees, picked up the crucifix from the floor, pointed it towards Jessica Samser and said, “By the power of god I condemn thee back to hell!” Jessica let out one last shrill, bloodcurdling scream and exploded into a pool of blood. Anthony sighed and collapsed onto the floor. He laid there for what seemed like an eternity. Viktor then woke up, complaining about his head. “Hey Viktor.” Said Anthony. 
“Yeah?” said Viktor, who was still quite groggy from the hit in his head.
“You owe me twenty bucks.”

[WP] You are a priest who blesses blankets to protect people from monsters as they sleep. As part of the Quality Assurance team you have to hunt down the defective ones before danger befalls the unwitting victim's.,scribbles33,"It moves so fast. Out of the darkness from the closet in a single stride, and then killing Kowalski before I can even scream, can give him any kind of warning. 

He falls to his knees, blood bubbling blackly from the ruins of his throat. He reaches out to me, mouths something I can't hear through the earplugs. I freeze. I don't know what to do.

And then the glowsticks fizzle out. All of them, all at once, totally. I'm back in blackness, lost in an empty void. Trapped here, with it. It could be anywhere.

I panic. I know I shouldn't and I know it makes it worse and makes it dangerous and I can't stop and I don't know what to do and it's so dark and Kowalski's dead. Kowalski's dead and he was at my wedding and we've been partners for three years and he's dead and...

And I'm still here. And it's still here. And it's going to get me too. 

I clench my hands, hold tightly to the gun, and try to breathe. There's no point hiding, or taking cover. I don't remember where the door is. If I calm down, I might have a chance. It hasn't got me yet. Maybe I have a few moments.

It feeds on fear. It takes our fear and turns it into strength. It gets stronger when I panic, when I let it into my head. I won't do that any more. 

Kowalski's dead. The kid's lost in the darkness. He won't recover even if we could get him out. He's just an empty shell now, panic and terror and nothing else - food for it. 

I won't let it get me too. I might die, but on my terms. I'm going to hurt it. Kowalski's killer isn't getting away free. 

I need light. It feeds on fear and hides in darkness. I won't give it fear, and I won't give it darkness. 

I drop the gun. It's useless in the dark, useless without a target. 

There's a flare strapped to my left arm, and a lighter in my right pocket. A lighter designed to work in storms, in high winds and hanging upside down from mountainsides. A lighter that won't fail. 

It's somewhere close to me. Maybe behind me, or in front of me. Maybe clinging to the ceiling above me, ready to pounce. It doesn't matter. 

It can kill me any time, but it hasn't yet. It wants me to be afraid first. It wants me to be afraid, and that gives me a chance. 

I bring the lighter round to the flare's short fuse, depressing the little lever as I do. 

Bright, white light. Brighter than the pallid glowsticks, brighter than the torch, brighter than the floodlights outside on the lawn. A starburst of illumination in the centre of the void, impossible to look at. 

With the light comes agony, comes pain. I feel myself scream with it, smell my own flesh burning. I don't care. 

I can't look to my left where the flare is burning. But I can see everything else. See the bedroom thrown into stark relief, every shadow banished in an instant. And I can see it. 

It crouches in front of me, one elongated arm covering its eyes from the glare. It lives in darkness, and now there is nowhere to hide. 

Even the darkness in the closet is forced back, weakened. In the depths - far further than any closet should stretch, far further than would fit in the house - I glimpse a pale, frightened face. 

I am on fire. I can see the flames leaping in my peripheral vision, almost dark against the brighter light of the flare. I can't release it now - the straps holding it to my arm will long since have melted into me. I and the flare will burn together. 

Kowalski's dead. The kid - Tommy - isn't going to make it out of here either. I'm going to burn up. But we're not the only ones who are dying tonight. 

I ignore the gun. It can't help me now. We're well beyond blankets. Instead, I charge.

It stumbles backwards as I come for it, moving away from the light back towards the closet. If it gets there, closes the door, then it will be safe. It will be wrapped in darkness, far from the burning flare. I don't give it the chance. 

I'm still building speed when I hit it, wrapping both arms around it and continuing on, half shoving, half carrying it. It's oddly light - a thing of claws and shadow, but little substance. It barely slows me down. 

We cross the closet threshold together, falling into a well of blackness. This would be suicide, but I'm already dying. This would be pointless, except the flare comes with me. 

I twist as we fall, looking back out at the empty room. I see Kowalski's body on the floor. I see the closet door swinging slowly closed behind us. I think I see - just a glimpse, a flicker, a suggestion - a small figure stumble through the doorway as it closes. 

And then the door is closed, and the thing is writhing in my arms and I am in the heart of its darkness, its secret sanctuary, its last retreat. I am in the black, empty void it comes from, burning and dying, and there is so much light.

Internal doors are never the most stable, and I lead with my shoulder rather than bothering with the handle. Behind me, I hear the whine of electronics starting up as Kowalski kicks the torch into overdrive. Light flares behind me, and for a brief moment, as I charge forward, the darkness falls back.

I see the room in front of me, the darkness recoiling back into the corners. The kid’s bed - shaped like a race car - is overturned on the floor. I don’t see the kid. Directly ahead of me, on the far wall, the closet door yawns open. Blackness swirls and twists inside, untouched by the light. 

I’m two steps inside when the light cuts out. 

Instantly, panic yawns inside me. I stumble, stop, stand still in the pitch black. I know there’s light outside the window, but there’s none here. There’s nothing here except the blackness.

The whispering is louder, twining around me while the darkness presses close, and it’s clearer now. It would be so easy to listen, to let it tell me everything I want to know. But I can’t. 

I force myself to slow down. To think. To breathe. 

I need light, lots of it. But that’s not the most important thing. Fear is worse than darkness, feeds it more. Every movement has to be deliberate; I can’t fumble or flee. That would let it in. I have to be slow. If I’m sure, if I’m confident, I’ll be fine. It can’t hurt you if you aren’t scared. 

Slowly, I relax the grip of my left hand on the gun. It won’t do any good in the dark. I ignore the whispers as I slowly, carefully reach down to my belt, to the neat row of three glowsticks hanging there. Calmly. Carefully. Not afraid. 

The torch must have burnt out. That happens sometimes, shining full blast. The shadows drain energy fast, force electronics to work harder. The clinging darkness puts a lot of stress on everything. 

Behind me, I’m sure, Kowalski is doing the same as me. Calming himself. Stopping the panic rising. Refusing to feel fear. We train for this. 

It can’t hurt you if you aren’t afraid. It needs fear to come out, fear to hiss and touch and harm. 

I’m not afraid. Kowalski’s not afraid. And that means we’ll be fine. If there’s no fear to feed on, then it’s just shadows. I select the first glowstick, and slide it out of the belt loop.

And then I remember the boy. 

I didn’t see him in the room. He might be dead. He might be curled up beneath the overturned bed. He might have passed out. 

Or he’s in the closet. If we were really late. If it had time to build up enough fear, time to grow strong enough to take him fully into the dark. 

I’ve heard about it. A couple of stories, over the years. Arriving not just late, but much too late. They aren’t good stories. It gives them a lot of power, to have a life in the dark with them. A constant, screaming, source of fear.

I move faster now, still trying to be calm, but worried. I didn’t see the kid at all. The whole room was lit up, the bed wasn’t that big, but I didn’t see him.

I don’t want to drop the gun, and that makes the glowstick harder to use. I have to kneel, brace one end of the glowstick against the floor, and bear down on it heavily. 
I don’t hear the crack through the earplugs, but sickly green light blossoms near the floor. Not much, but growing all the time. I reach for a second glowstick, knowing that even at full strength, it won’t be enough.

Still calm, still breathing slowly, two glowsticks lit, I look up. The darkness is still close around me, still sluggishly flowing around the room, but it’s no longer pitch black. I can make out vague shapes.  

Kowalski is in the room with me, no longer holding the useless torch. We can pick it up on our way out. Like me, he’s holding a glowstick in one hand, another on the floor at his feet. 

With four glowsticks lit, still brightening slowly, we’re okay. We can see. We’re still alive. We just need to find the kid, close the closet door, and get out of here. We’re okay.

In the pallid light, my earlier fears recede. It won’t be like those other places. The kid isn’t lost to the dark. He might not recover, but we’ll make it out of here. No one else will get hurt. 

I nod to Kowalski, smiling at him. He smiles back, just as the claws rip through his throat. ",Peritract

Paging Mr. and Mrs. Johnston at gate C41 please.*

A moderately adequate and average pair of parents trudged up, holding the hands of their six year old.  Slowly, his blanket dragging his feet, his blanket and his sleep with him, the child finally's expression finally tapered off into a muddy state of nap time and cry time.  The former won him over.


""Hi there, you paged us? Is there an issue?""  Mr. Johnston of average height, average size, average age, an acceptable height with a slight bulge at his stomach.  His blandness wouldn't stand out in a crowd.  


""Yes, Mr. Johnston.  It has been reported that your luggage was recently stolen.""  For such a normal looking man, his expression of shock was one of severe emotion.  Who knew that clothing and blankets in a suitcase could case so much trauma?


""It has also been reported that the luggage was found and returned to the loading cart. We wanted to inform you, well in advanced of your travel."" His emotions waned slightly.


""Did they take anything? I only brought my laptop for work!""  His wife scowled at him and picked her son up.


""I'm sorry Miss, but is there anything we can do before the plane takes off? I have  an old blanket that I want to make sure that is still in there. I inherited from my grandmother.""


Shaking her head, the attendant simply responded in the negative. There would be a compensation if anything was stolen, and provided the couple with a business card to call in the event that something was wrong.


Passing over the PA to another attendant, she excused herself, taking off the silly flight attendant hat.  Such gaudy colors, conflicting with one another.  Heading to the bathroom, she recited her incantations and prepared for the ritual to complete the spell.


That blanket had been one of the earliest ones. While still in one piece, it had holes. Holes that needed to be mended, spiritually and physically. While it had been fixed piecemeal, it never was renewed with the power of the afterafter.


In the bathroom, she gave a quiet prayer, drawing from the woman's emotions and connection to the blanket, renewing a sense of protection.",imakhink

As part of the Quality Assurance team you have to hunt down the defective ones before danger befalls the unwitting victim's.,scribbles33,"*This ended up being three comments long, sorry. The whole thing is below.*

We have a good response time. Really good, in fact. We can be on the road within five minutes after getting the call, and can reach anywhere in the county within half an hour. Average response time is only fifteen minutes. There aren't many teams, anywhere in the country, who can say that. 

It's still not enough. Fifteen minutes, for a kid trapped with one of them, is a long time. We get there fast, but rarely fast enough. 

This call wasn't a close one.  Twenty minutes drive, with clear roads. Plus the five minutes to suit up, plus however long it took for the parents to notice what was happening. By the time we got there, the kid would have been in the dark for at least twenty-five minutes. Probably closer to an hour. 

Once it gets past about fifteen minutes, retrieval stops being a realistic option. Anything you could pull out of there, you wouldn't want. It changes them, on the inside if not the outside, and ""saving"" the kid after that isn't a kindness. 

So we knew, going in there, that we were aiming for containment. We wouldn't be able to save the kid, but we could stop the situation getting worse. 

The van screeched to a halt outside the house, and we were moving. It was obvious that we had the right address - the crying parents outside were a clue. As was the swirling darkness pressing against the upstairs windows - from *inside* the house, and the wavering, high-pitched screaming that cut through every other noise.

We drill every day, and so setting up is second nature. In under a minute, we were ready to breach. The floodlights were aimed at the windows, stopping it leaving that way. The speaker system - mounted on the van - was blaring out lullabies. For now, it was contained. 

That made it my turn. Mine and Kowalski's. 

There's always a lull, just before the breach. The light pushes it back away from the windows. The lullabies slow it down. Once you put the ear plugs in, blocking out all the noise, it just looks like a normal house. A safe house. Nothing to worry about. 

I looked at Kowalski. We nodded to each other. I could see his mouth moving in time with mine as we counted to three. Then I put my hand on the door, and pushed it open. Show time. 

-------------------------------------
Inside the house, it's dark. Very dark. Darker than you'd think it could be, with the floodlights shining across the lawn. The light spills across the threshold, but no further - within a few feet of the door, the shadows take over again. 

Kowalski walks behind me, as I move further into the house. He holds the torch over my shoulder - it's a powerful beam, 3000 lumens of white light, but it still doesn't stretch that far. Outside the house, the torch could shine a spotlight across a football field. Inside, it lights only a few metres ahead of me. Enough to see where to place my feet, work out where the furniture is. Not much more. 

I'm grateful for the light though. It will get darker as we go. 

We find the staircase, start climbing them. The darkness presses closer, the torch beam weak and yellow, unable to pierce the shadows at the top of the stairs.

Fourteen steps in the average staircase. Fourteen steps from the ground floor to the first. Each one is an effort. The darkness swirls around us, almost a physical weight as I lift each foot and place it down. It's a cold November night, but I'm warm. Too warm, as though something large is in here with us, breathing hot in the dark. 

I clutch the gun in my hands, find comfort in the bulky shape. I tell myself it's okay to be scared. It's natural to be scared. That's how they work. The important thing is not to panic. 

The whispering starts on the sixth step. It goes through the earplugs - they can block out any other noise, but they only dampen the whispering. You'd think they weren't worth wearing, just to lower the volume slightly, but I've seen - too many times - what happens to people who get the full effect. 

It isn't really words. Not most of the time. Just a formless muttering, sounds that almost - if you strained, if you took the earplugs out, might make sense. It's always a temptation - just to listen, just to catch what they say. It might help us fight them, or explain how to ward them away. It might be worth it. 

But it's not. It never will be. The whispers just want you to think it's a good idea. I'm not going to fall for it; I've seen it too many times. I've helped restrain too many people, visited asylums too many times. Whatever the whispers are saying, it's lies. 

We reach the top. Stand on the last step before the landing. Breathe in and out, slowly. It's important to be calm before going further. Breathe. 

One last equipment check. I run my hand over the glowsticks in my belt, ready for an emergency. I check the gun, make sure the canister is loaded, that I've remembered the spares. I check the flare strapped to my arm, make sure the fuse is free. It's all fine - of course it is. We drill every day. But the tiniest doubt, the lightest flicker of uncertainty, can be deadly. You have to be confident. You have to be sure. 

The beam of light jiggles up and down as Kowalski checks the battery level. It will be draining fast, but still should be good for another ten of fifteen minutes. We should have enough light. 

He taps me on the shoulder, and we start moving again. It's a small landing, with three doors opening off it. Kowalski swings the torch at each one in turn, looking for the right door.

The first two doors are nothing - the yellow light shows up white-painted wood, nothing more. The third is different. 

The light hits the door, but doesn't light it up. The light stops, illuminating nothing but blackness. It takes long moments for the shadows to draw back, and when they do, they do so reluctantly. Slowly. 

Eventually, there's a little circle of light on the door. Dim, dirty light, with shadows lapping at the edges. The hole in the darkness shows a name - coloured letters on the white paint spell out ""Tommy"". 

This is the door. It's through there. 

Tommy's through there.

[WP] You are a priest who blesses blankets to protect people from monsters as they sleep. As part of the Quality Assurance team you have to hunt down the defective ones before danger befalls the unwitting victim's.,scribbles33,"Part of being an evangelist is getting doors slammed in your face. It's simply part of the job. For father Marco it took a special kind of grace to not simply head to the pub and sod the whole business, since he wasn't an evangelist anymore. All he wanted today was to be allowed to finish a sentence before getting shut out, especially because of the driving rain. He knocked on the wide red door of number 15 Barrister court, and put on his best ass-kissing smile. He was greeted by an overweight balding man in ill-fitting grey flannel pajamas and wearing a perfectly tailored sour look. He managed to get out ""hello,"" before a grumbly ""we don't want any"" was pushed through gritted teeth and the door was closed so violently it shook the frame. He looked down at his bible, slim black and emblazoned with a shimmering cross. He contemplated replacing it with a pint. A voice in his head told him ""no such luck""

Hammering on the door got the sour man back to the door. ""If I have to call the cops on you you're going to be bloody upset!"" he roared, but this time when the door swung open father Marco elbowed his way inside and stuffed a slightly sodden envelope into the mans mitts. ""Hello, I represent the Canterbury abbey blessed bedclothes company. It has come to our attention that one of a small group of defective curse-resistant couvertures has found its way to your home. May I come in and rectify the issue?"" The man flapped his mouth like a fish for a moment and then finally conceded ""well I guess your already here, might as well."" And slammed the door behind them.

After depositing his sodden coat on the hall coatrack, he took stock of the foyer. It was a warm and homely decor, all deep carpets and autumnal colors, capped by a fiery red floral wallpaper. Despite the cozy atmosphere, the room was noticeably chilly. Not a good sign. ""Where is the blanket?"" Marco asked, looking to the stairs. It was up there somewhere, that he knew. ""In our sons room, first left off the landing"" Marco moved quickly up the stairs, the homeowner two steps behind. ""Is your son in there, mister..."" ""Oswald. Fred Oswald, and no. Jacob left to go to indoor football practice about an hour ago."" Finally some good news.

The landing and upstairs hall were a deep emerald green, a color-shifted version of the same loud floral that coated the walls below. The temperature up here was a few degrees colder. He took off towards the left hand door. He reached out to touch the handle, but something stopped him. He clutched the spine of his bible a little tighter, and the book seemed to squirm in his hand. ""Mister Oswald, are you aware of the issues that may come from a malfunctioning curse-proof couverture?"" Fred coughed awkwardly ""well I should imagine it would fail to protect against curses."" He looked unhappy, and could clearly sense the incremental drop in temperature as acutely as Marco did. ""Not precisely. Our blessings function similar to a magnet, and should we misalign the poles, so to speak..."" Fred's face fell as understanding crept into his mind ""they act as an attractant"" he huffed.

 ""I thought Jacob looked a little poorly recently. Well, carry on. No need for me to get involved."" Fred disappeared down the stairs post haste. This was a comfort to Marco, glad to be the only one involved in the madness to come. However, he could feel him lurking at the bottom of the stairs and knew he'd scamper up as soon as the door shut. He considered leaving, telling Fred he'd been incorrect and to have a nice day, and going to collect his pint. He felt his bible shimmy at this thought. No chance. He reached out for the door handle, and thought ""blessed are we, the faithful.""

The room was the temperature of a walk-in refrigerator, and thin flecks of frost lay on the outside of the sachet. There was a creak of floorboards and a muffled rustle from outside the door. He spun around, taking in the standard teenage bedroom mash up of mothers furniture and child's posters. A landscape with a Lamborghini in it was over the victorian chest of drawers, and a cheeky pin-up of a female tennis player scratching her ass was where the open door would hide it. The bedspread was poorly made up and there was a pile of clothes poking out of the closet.

He raised his bible in one hand to chest height, and let it drop to floor. It have a heavy metallic whump and seemed to resonate for a moment, like a much heavier thing than it was. The creeping cold began to pierce him, and the room's ambient light seemed to flicker. He was not alone. He closed his eyes and felt around for the interloper. His fingers searching the frigid air until...he opened his eyes and found them locked on the mirror. He  stared into the deep hazel pits of his eyes, but it wasn't him staring back out of them. ""Are you going to come out and play?"" He whispered at the looking glass. The reflection smiled a smile that was not his own.

A violent thunderclap from outside shook the house, and Marco shot a glare at the window as rain rattles it in it'a frame. There was a crystalline crack, and when he looked back at the mirror there was a spiderweb crack across its surface. He stepped back and his eyes found the bed, where once the cream and blue lace blanket had been rumpled, it was now military tight. ""Come on then, beast!"" He roared, fists balled and with an expression of fury. A small lump in the bedspread rose, then spread, roiling outwards and flapping as If in a strong breeze. It was now or never.

He leapt forward, and snatched the heavy bible from the floor. It's pages surged open, fluttering in an unseen wind. He dipped his hand among the pages, warm and soft like deep fur. He searched for but a moment as the bedspread rustled more violently, until his fingers found rough leather and smooth steel. The saber of Gabriel slid effortlessly from the pages, filling the room with a silver light and a furnace-like heat that emanated from its shimmering blade.  Wasting no time, Marco drove it into the bed. There was an inhuman shriek, and the blanket rose in a twisting spiral upwards, caught in a slick black mass that spun and spiraled into grotesque forms. A tendril licked out from the mass, and Marco hopped out of its way, letting it leave a deep scrape in the oaken floor. He darted forward and gave a ferocious slash. Another howl tore from the beast, and the blanket snapped to ceiling for a moment, then dropped in taters to the floor.

Marco pointed the blade at it for a moment, then prodded the pile of ripped linens. Nothing. He looked at the ceiling, and knew. He had it on the run. As he turned to the door he heard a rustle, and spun on his heel fast enough to see the blanket whip at him. He gave it another viscous slash and drove the saber to the hilt into it, but not before it had cut a shallow slash in his arm. He cursed, seeing blood as he touched his fingers to the wound, and plunged the blade into the blanket thrice more. Tricky bastard.

Of all the things Fred Oswald imagined he'd see come out his sons bedroom, a bleeding Father Marco holding a longsword  was not one of them. He stammered as The holy father's furious gaze found his. ""Do you have an attic?"" Fred nodded ""take me."" The stair was narrow and the aperture inky black, but father Marco piled up as quick as he could, eager to end this folderol as soon as possible. As His torso rose into the darkness, he heard a scamper across the pine paneled floor. He swung the blade up and parried the swipe with no trouble, vanishing a tendril of vileness into smoke. As he turned an inspected the cramped space he saw a shadow untouched in the far corner ""come now, there's a good lad"" he crossed and the shadow undulated and made threatening screech. ""Come now we both know its over. Come..."" He gave a final thrust into the shaded mass. It smoked and hissed, but father Marco simply opened his bible and began to recite. The beast faded, twisted and sizzled until the passage was over and only a stain on the wood remained. ""Go in peace, you mouthy son of a bitch.""

Outside, the sun had come out and a bread van full of priests had arrived and gone upstairs to clean up the damaged bedroom. Marco suspected the tennis player would vanish as well, but he had a clean bandage on his arm and a warm pint of Newcastle. His bible fizzes happily under his arm, saber nestled somewhere among it's profound passages. Marco then mused, he must have the worst job at any textile company in the world.",enjolras1782

Finishing, he took the bottle of Holy Water that he just blessed and gently brushed the blanket with it, creating a watery cross on top, the final step in assuring the ""monsters"" won't harm the wearer.

""Ah, finishing up here, Father Amadeus?"" spoke a voice. Greg's, to be exact. 

""Indeed. You only needed five, correct? Water is a resource we shouldn't be wasting, Greg. Damn bastards are lucky you started letting people in again.""

Amadeus was a priest, in the loosest of terms, at least nowadays. Before the world went to shit, he was a kind and gentle fellow. But then - as I've said before - the world went to shit, and he was forever changed. Was the past necessary to explain? Everyone has been through shit, wife died, son died, both parents died. Whatever it was, if you've made it this far, you're certain to have lost someone you knew that you loved.

Greg nodded and took the blankets and opened the door, ""I want you to meet them,"" he said. 

He kept his foot in the doorway to leave a crack open for Amadeus to leave as well. When the light of the world shined into his eyes, he held his hand up to the ever-beating sun, and the fresh air overtook his lungs. As he walked through the community, he nodded at the people as they pass and went to greet the new people, unhappily. He wondered how Greg could trust so easily after what had happened last time, though Greg wasn't as emotionally maimed as Amadeus.

Greg handed the new survivors, or rather the newest survivors in the community, as everyone alive is a survivor, their blankets. 

""This is your protection during the night. While someone is always on watch, we are rebuilding the walls after our last attack as so we are vulnerable to the Roamers. For now. We have found out that the Roamers, or whatever you people have been calling them, do not like the smell of Holy Water.""

Silence erupted between the new meat, this couldn't possible be true. Then someone spoke, ""Bullshit. You really expect us to believe that? God doesn't exist, he's the one that made this hellhole for us. If you believe that, all y'all are bunch of pussies and I can't be the one to carry a group of zombie bait. I'm out of here,"" he said as he began to walk away.

Amadeus pulled out his revolver and aimed it at the man, ""We wasted precious water on that blanket, you better be fucking grateful for all of this.""

The rest of the new survivors pulled out their guns and aimed it at Amadeus. Greg pulled out his, and the rest of the community aimed it at the four of them. Losing Amadeus would lose the protection in the night. The blankets lose their protective nature if the priest who blessed the water has also died, as they so harshly learned from the last time.

Luckily, the people were smart enough to disengage and put away their weapons, seeing as they were outnumbered. 

The man turned around with his hands up, ""Easy Padre, I won't leave. But the whole idea is a little fucking ridiculous, no?""

Amadeus put his revolver away, ""I agree, but it works. Early into the start of the, well, I guess I'll just call it what it is, the apocalypse, I was a weak man. I was held up in my church and the Roamers came through and attacked my first group. I ran because I was weak, I ran because it was the only thing I knew how to do, I'd never faced these things before. And it was my watch. Who would trust me with that? But as I ran out, I spilled a bottle of holy water over someone who was asleep. Out of everyone, they were completely unharmed. Until she woke up. I don't know what it was, maybe it was the fact your body temperature goes down when you sleep or... something else, I don't really know.""

Reluctantly, the group of people took the blankets. The group didn't take many chances, and so they were being watched carefully.

Greg approached Amadeus after, ""Ease up, they won't harm us. I promise you,"" and he offered his smile. Amadeus put his gun back into it's holster and walked away but stopped short. ""You let me into the group and I'm thankful you did. Just don't be stupid about who you let in, Greg. I earned my place, it wasn't handed to me. It should stay that way."" 

Later that night, Greg, who was on watch, woke him up. ""Amadeus, the water you used on the blankets. Jeremy took it from the water basin that the Roamers were in, he didn't know. The blankets you gave the new survivors are defec-"" and then all of a sudden, they heard a scream. ""LIAR!""

The blood-curdling scream continued, this time incomprehensible, as if someone was being torn apart.

""Son of a bitch!"" He said, calling out to God. He sprung up to his feet and ran outside and went to the shack that housed the five new people. One of the roamers got in from the damaged wall and attacked the nearest shack, their shack. Amadeus shot the Roamer on top of a girl and then immediately shot the girl. No chances. He noticed that one of them didn't have a blanket, ""Where is it?!"" He yelled, and then he pointed to a group member's shack.

""Shit,"" he thought and started running as fast as he could to Lauren's shack but he stopped short. One of the new members started running away, the man who wanted to leave from earlier. The Roamers were already attracted to the camp from the gunshot along with the girl screaming from before, and he was immediately taken down from the ever-encroaching horde.

Greg ran over to help but Amadeus yelled, ""GREG! DON'T! HE'S GONE!""

CRUNCH! 

He got too close, one of them bit him in the shoulder. All Greg could do was look at Amadeus. He smiled, he knew it was his end.

Several bloody hands started ripping and clawing at his face, and Amadeus watched as Greg was being bitten and torn apart. He died doing what he believed was right, but Amadeus though that was foolish.

Amadeus fell to his knees, ""Why, God?""

He heard a scream from the shack he was previously running to. It wasn't over yet, and he certainly wasn't going to let this group die. Greg would've wanted everyone to live.

Amadeus sprung up and headed over to the shack as quickly as he could. A Roamer was entering it as he came near. Leaping to it, he pulled out his knife and stabbed it right in the head, Roamer blood spilling to the floor. But he was too late, there were already four of them on the group member. He took them all out and looked at his friend. 

He slowly lifted up his gun, grasping it tightly and pointing it at his friend. ""May you rest in peace, my child.""

Boom. It fired. In a fit of rage, he left the shack and started taking out all of them with his knife. First one went down, then another, then the next two at the same time. Bodies and bodies were falling one after another. 

This was his fault. At least, that's what he believed, and he needed to keep the rest of the community alive. For Greg. 

The night turned to day, hours have passed since the last one was killed. The crowd gathered around to mourn the lost, to accept the newcomers, and to forget the horrors they face every day.

All of them looked to Amadeus. Collectively, they asked, ""What next?""",Rasumii

'And did he stick his feet out from the covers?' 

'No! I've told you already he used it properly!'

'Did he use the bathroom that night?'

'How should I know? It's not like I can ask him!'

'I'm sorry ma'am but it is necessary for our investigation to ask these questions. He does always cut his nails and brush his teeth right?' 

'Well-'

'Well what?'

'We always tell him to but he doesn't-'

'Yes, just as I thought. See how his teeth and fingers are missing? The teeth are the work of Karius and Bactus I'm afraid and the fingers were Struwwelpeter. Nothing to do with our product unfortunately.' 

A typical day. Most of our products were top notch so most investigations turned out like this. Careless mistakes in your basic monster prevention routines. Sadly, it meant that most of the claimants I investigated were kids, their parents were usually looking for someone to blame. It was easier to blame a product like a blanket than the child or worse their own parenting. Just as the mother began to wail my phone began to vibrate.

'Father Hoffman, are you in the field?'

'I'm in Mayweather township investigating the Thomas Berry Case'

'Good, we need you to get to Bay Town as quick as you can. Father Jules has just admitted that he made up some of the words in the mass he gave on the Sunday before he blessed a new batch of blankets'

'Damn! How many?'

'Fortunately most of them were still unsold by the time we found out but we've tracked three of the defiled blankets to Bay Town'

'Do you have an address?'

'No but we are working on it'

'Damn damn damn'

I know I shouldn't curse so much; it had caused me a few close calls in the past. I muttered a quick apology to the icon of Mary I wore. I had it custom made, it was meant to protect profaners, though I couldn't expect it to hold up forever. 

I ran to the car, there was still four hours until bedtime so hopefully I could find it before anything happened. The drive was excruciating- it always is. Bay town was only an hour away but the road I was on afforded a picturesque view of the coast. A view that let me see the sun slowly sinking to the sea like an axe falling in slow motion.  Who knew how much time it would take to find it once I had got there?

'Any luck on getting that address HQ?'

'No not yet, looks like the buyer bought in cash. We only got Baytown from the shop keeper. Said they looked like tourists though.'

'Oh so I only have to find a tourist in bay town? Why didn't you say so! Should be a piece of piss then.'

'Watch your language Father, and your sarcastic tone. It gives you somewhere to start doesn't it?' 

'What if they've already got on the boat home?'

'I don't know but if it's a souvenir maybe they won't use it tonight? Hotels have their own blankets after all.' 

The thought of hotels made me shudder. Back when I was just starting out some punk thought it would be a hilarious prank to replace all the blankets in his hotel with un-blessed sheets on Halloween night. It was a massacre. I still remember the smell. 

'Father?'

'Yes, sorry I was thinking. Souvenir?'

'Yeah It's a special one. It's got a big picture of the island embroidered on it. It's pretty tacky to be honest'

'Ha!'

'Judge not lest ye be judged father.'

'No! It's not that- I know where it is. It’s going to be in the Pirate Experience Hotel!'

'Now that is judgmental'

'No no. They have a contest every week where the kid who designs the best treasure map gets a prize.'

'You- you like the Pirate Experience resort then father?'

'I used to go as a kid. Every year someone would get one of those blankets draw an X on it and try to pass it off as his own map!'

'So there's a chance they won't use it?'

'Best not to risk it'

It only took an extra thirty minutes to get to the Pirate Experience Resort.  I was feeling lighter than an angel. It never worked out this well normally. But after another hour of knocking on doors in the huge resort I was beginning to lose hope. The sun was staring to hang very low in the sky. Half the rooms didn't answer. Half didn't know what I was talking about. Only an hour and a half until bedtime. I nearly had given up hope when I noticed a poster flapping lazily in the warm early evening breeze. 

KIDS SLEEP OVER IN THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS- Bring PJs, torches, and blessed blankets for a fun night of storytelling, crafts, and adventure with Petey pirate and friends! No children over 12 or under six. 

The captain's quarters were across the park but I ran as hard as I could. I couldn't be sure the blanket wasn't still in the huge hotel complex behind me but I had a hunch. I had to hope god was on my side tonight. 

'DAAAAAMN'

Apparently he wasn't as I fell over the tail of a fake alligator. I limped slowly onward as the light faded all around me and a chill set my hairs on end. I could call HQ but they wouldn't get here faster than I could. The resort employees had refused to help when I had arrived. Something about liability and that they couldn't take responsibility when patrons incite monsters or bring cursed objects into the park. I damned them all under my breath and apologized again to Mary. But I finally reached the captains quarters as the sun's fingers disappeared under the ocean.  

I burst into a room of sleeping 6-12 year olds. In the dark I frantically searched for the map blanket. Children awoke and began screaming but I ignored them- it was just part of the job. Then I saw it. Well not the blanket so much as the eight foot winged centipede heading straight toward the corner. 

Some days you just' can’t win. Some days you end up reading someone their last rites as monster makes off with their legs. But not today. I wasn't going to let them win today. It was a hail Mary but I had to try something. I tore the icon from my neck and flung it across the room. My heart nearly stopped. But it worked. The icon landed on the sleeping child. It wasn’t strong enough to hold of the creature on its own but damn if the dumb beast wasn’t confused. Just confused enough to let me get there and cover the child in a truly holy blanket. 

Yeah there’s going to be a lot of paperwork tomorrow. I’m not sure the bishop is going to understand why I had to claim an all access pass to the Pirate Experience on my expenses. I’m pretty sure throwing icons is a sin. But for today that kid is safe. And that's enough. 

'Damn'

There were two more blankets.

Even in his debilitating youth he insisted he could live independently. Thing is, he also insisted he was too sprucy for his beta blockers, so they designated me to go check on him every day on the slavishly boring drive home from school, which also wasn’t going so well. Bullies? Nope, just the math problems. They told me I needed to write my variables on the left side of the equals sign. They followed such silly rules, and made ME follow them too. Confinement was the theme. All the rules, postulates, and theorems; everything they did confined me into a smaller and smaller box. 

Speaking of which, there was at odd brown box waiting at my feet. Funny, ‘cause Mr. Hastings always made a point of sending his mail to his vacation home. 

Suddenly, the door opened.

“Hi, Mr. Hastin-,” this wasn’t Mr. hastings.

Towered in front of me was a strange diabolical amalgamation of Mr. Hastings and a ridiculously oversized rubber duck. 

“What the fu-”

“QUACK,” it screamed. 

I ducked to avoid getting beheaded by it’s bill as it stepped onto the porch. As I looked down, I crammed my head into the box. Rubber, The feel of vulcanized rubber, like the rubber baseball my little sister played with. I yanked my tiny head out of the box, and got a headful of little rubber ducks with it. Not knowing quite what to make of this odd predicament, I booked it right towards the main road, but my sneaker caught water instead of asphalt. I splashed into a pond that submerged the stretch of land where the old road used to be.I looked to my left first, then my right. The cottage where the Lancasters used to live was instead replaced by horsetail and lily pads. 

I didn’t know how to swim, but I seemed to be content and somehow blissful as I drowned and sunk towards the pond bed. What a better way to die than in duckland. Everyone in my usual life was just a big duck at the end of the day, right?",A_D_reamer

""Eyes on me maggots!""

It was the drill sergeant. We stood to attention. 

""This is Major Adams, who will be overseeing your training here.""

I strained to see over the shoulder of the man in front of me. A small, yellow rubber duck with a military cap was on the floor in front of the recruits. The Drill sergeant picked it up and held it out in front of us.

""Major Adams here has seen combat in 5 different theatres of war, and has a military record as long as your arm. You will treat his every word as though it had come from God himself.""

""Papa?"" he asks, voice filled with confusion as to why he isn't paying attention. He clutches a rubber duck, walking towards the man with his clumsy four-year-old gait.

The boy tugs on his father's hand, small hand wrapped around a few fingers. 

The man just sits there. 

He squeezes the duck again, emanating a squeak. It's comforting to the boy, erasing the thick silence of the room. He climbs up onto his lap, putting the duck on his shoulder. Surely his papa will laugh at that? Make a joke about pirates, and hug him close?

""Papa?"" The man's eyes stare ahead, looking but not seeing. ""Papa?"" The boy tugs on his beard, and his head falls forward.

Tears stream down his face as his mother scoops him up, and takes him out of the room, the happy-looking yellow duck falling to the floor as he wraps his arms around his mother. She shushes him as she sets him down in his room, pushing a teddy-bear into his arms to calm him. 

He hears her anguished cries as she talks on the phone. 

All he wants is bath time, for his father to plop him down into the tub, so he can just play with his rubber duck. 

----------------------

He shambles over to the simple wood coffin, and his mother picks him up. He sees his father, hair tucked over a gunshot, forehead wiped clean. She's pale, eyes puffy and red, a frown set on her face. 

He sets down the rubber duck next to him. ""Papa needs to have fun in his baths, too.""

That was not my destiny. Nope, I spent three decades on that rock, slowly learning the ways of the force from Yoda. But this story isn’t about those decades. Nope, this story is about the “trials”—the Jedi equivalent of a final exam.

I had to confront the cave. My weapons? I did not need them. I took only myself into that cave and I, for one, didn’t kill my father/myself in some sort of weird slow motion quasi-dream sequence. So suck on that, Luke.

But the trials are about more than just a psychological exam. For me, clumsiness has always been my biggest weakness. As bad of a shot as stormtroopers might be, Jedi still need to know how to dodge lasers. Since getting shot with a real laser might hurt, the next best thing is to learn how to dodge rubber bullets. Those sting, but they won’t burn a hole through you if you mess up. And I always mess up.

But not today. Today, I passed the course with flying colors. Yoda isn’t particularly effusive with praise, but I have never been prouder (oh wait, pride is wrong for a Jedi, right?) than when Yoda exclaimed “Mhmmmm! Learned to *rubber duck* have you. Mhmmmm!”

Mr. Crab blinked his eye-stalks as the light crept over them, not quite waking up.  He rolled his body over and away from the light.  He’d get up later.  He’d been up too late the night before playing music on his banjo (he hated the fiddle) and there was no way he was going to get up at the claw-crack of dawn just to wave to all his neighbors.  He planned to pull himself out of bed after the morning greetings died down and he could shovel sand around in peace.

Plans change.

The usual clamor of, “Hi,” “Hi,” “Hi,” “Hi,” “Hi,” “Hi,” “Hi,” was replaced this morning with a uniform “ooh” and “ahh.”  It was enough to pique Mr. Crab’s subconscious and wake him.  

“All right, what’s with all the hubbub!” he shouted as he skittered from his hovel.  Everyone was staring at him.  No, not at him, behind him--oceanside.  Crab whirled, his smaller claw prepared to give a rude gesture to crabever was causing the commotion.  Instead, his maxillopeds fell open and his eyestalks bulged.

“I play the banjo,” muttered Crab, under his carapace.  He spoke up, all stalks on him, “What do you mean, chosen?”

“I don’t rightly know, to be honest.  In my life none that were chosen have ever returned to tell the tale.  It’s just the way that it is.  The way it’s always been.  You’ll ride the Duck out to Sea and voyage the Tides.  That’s all I know.”  

“Why me, though?  What do I have to offer?” The hermit drug himself up to Mr. Crab and looked him up and down.

The two men appeared out of nowhere, a few yards apart in the narrow, moonlight lane.

That quote's by Arthur Weasley. Never heard of him? 

Well, he’s not real – he was a fictional character by this 21st century author. Something about magic, and teenage kids. I’m surprised how it ever got so successful.

It was a time, though, when you could afford to hope. A time before the Eliminators invaded Earth and toppled her governments. A time before humanity was reduced to a shadow of its former self.


The widespread reach of the series meant that even in our world, even hundreds of years later, it was possible to get your hands on copies. And in the Underground of the 25th century, there wasn’t much to do but read. 
So read I did. I escaped the grime, the dark, the bloodshed and the screams and escaped into a world of wizards and witches. Of struggle, and triumph.


And in some small way, I suppose, I saw myself in Harry. He too struggled with his own identity – and though he ran from Death Eaters, and I from Eliminators, we weren’t ever all too different.


Except for the fact, of course, that he was the Boy Who Lived. And I would not be.

    Thirty seconds. 

They were drawing closer. What is the function of a rubber duck? 

A toy?

A buoyant float?

Stress relief?

Even in the twenty-first century, it didn’t seem like anyone was ever sure what to do with one. They just sort of... persisted, regardless of target audience or market demand or whatever. I guess, in that way, it represented humanity pretty well.

It matched my gaze, almost as if to taunt me. How had one made its way down here, anyway? I resisted the urge to knock it over. Any movement now would be too risky.

     Twenty seconds.

An Eliminator’s boot stopped in front of my face. A strange garble alerted its squad.

What is the function of a rubber duck? A hygienic tool? A way to keep your kid quiet in the bath? A way to get rid of extra rubber? An attempt to make the longest lasting, most useless item ever? An itch formed under the weight of the explosive vest - no way I could scratch it now, though.

     Ten seconds.

In the 25th century? 

It was a symbol of humanity.

I thumbed the detonator.

The world dissolved.

All was well.

They've all been in and out of love with each other.,Chronophilia,"I set a basket of freshly laundered socks down on Miss Frey’s bed and pulled open the double doors to her closet. The walk-in was massive, easily the size of a trailer home, probably larger. I carried her plain black socks passed centuries of chronologically-sorted wardrobe. Nearest the door, she stored her contemporary attire. Miss Frey kept up with each decade’s styles to be sure, but as I proceeded back toward the armoire, I passed her collections of skirts and costume jewelry from the early 1900s, and then dresses and hats from all throughout the 1800s. Her items from the 1700s are particularly interesting - breeches, overcoats, military uniforms. As I understand it, Miss Frey had quite the time fighting in the War for American Independence, when she had decided that, as she puts it, she had been British for far too long.

Anything older than her colonial days was stored away specially for preservation, and thank goodness for that, or my walk back to the sock drawer might take all morning. I’d barely had time to finish folding and storing my basket’s worth before I heard a call from the bedroom door.

“Anita!” Miss Frey said, “Are you in there?”

“Yes, Miss Frey.” I lift the empty basket and carry it back out with me. “Something I can help with?”

“I’ve got an invitation,” she answered, as she handed me a folded green card. I examined it briefly. The host was named Daniel Greensby, a name I recognized but couldn’t entirely place. I assumed he was one of Miss Frey’s people. Whoever he was, Mister Greensby was throwing a summer gathering for old, presumably very old, friends at his home. 

“Should I send a response?” I asked.

“Not quite yet,” Miss Frey said, “I need you to research Daniel for me first. I’ve forgotten how exactly we knew each other.”

I nodded and answered, “Any thoughts on where to start?”

“I’d look in the late 17th century first, and move your way back from there.” I returned the invitation to her, and in return she passed me a dull brass key. 

“Of course, Miss Frey.”

I slipped downstairs and down the hall to Miss Frey’s private library, where beside her favorite pieces of literature were shelves and shelves of personal diaries, locked behind spiraling iron bars. With Miss Frey’s old key, I opened the bookcase, and began searching her forgotten years for Daniel Greensby. He turned up a bit further back than Miss Frey had guessed. The two had been acquainted in the Old World, as it turned out. More than that, in fact. They’d been married for a while, had three sons and a daughter, lived an entire lifetime together. I skimmed through their meeting, their wedding, their parting. I knew Miss Frey’s condition came with the loss of her distant past - recollection was half my work. Still, I couldn’t shake a strange chill. She’d only fleetingly identified the name of a father of her children. 

By Miss Frey’s own policy, though, I was not to recall lost families of years long gone. Instead I wrote her a quick note, avoiding as many of the details as possible - Daniel Greensby, former romantic partner, nothing objectionable.

"[WP] For years Earth cried out to an empty cosmos, searching the stars for echoes of life. From the middle of nowhere, a reply finally comes: ""Shut up, and Play Dead!""",Crapletunnel,"Possibly. I think of it as a plot issue when I find an event in the storyline not believable.

Here is a strong, real life example (and a fun, controversial one at that, so might be worth your time)...

I strongly disliked Star War - Revenge of the Sith, because I felt like Anakin's fall from grace was completely unconvincing. One minute he's rescuing Obi Wan Kenobi at all costs, and striving to save his wife, completely devoted to the Jedi Order. A vague mentor, suddenly confessing to be the enemy of the galaxy, tells him he knew someone who could have helped save his wife. The next minute, Anakin is literally murdering the people he grew up with, has known all his life, and has been literally brainwashed to depend upon. He viciously attacks his wife - the very person he was going berserk for - and attempts to kill his master, a person whom he had referred to as a father figure.

Now, yes, a person can go through a transition like that, to where they are accomplishing the exact opposite of what they desire and not even realize it. But I need to be convinced that they have effectively transitioned. For Anakin, I was not. As such, I consider that a failed plot point.

OP's story here could certainly happen. They could rewrite it to convince me that humanity really did come to the conclusion that their best bet was to turn back technological advancement and go dark. But to be honest, OP is up against a wall on this one because it would probably take thousands of words to effectively get my mind there. But that is what I felt.

Now, if you still feel like that's just me 'disagreeing with the text', I would actually be interested if you could explain the difference. :)

She knew it. When the signal came through, we were just as shocked as anyone to even receive a reply back. It had been 25 years since we first relayed messages to space in order to make contact with life outside of this solar system.

When message initially came back, it was staticky, but once we tweaked some of the settings, we understood ""Shut Up And Play Dead!"" The voice had a certain dark depth to it that concerned Sheila and I. We only needed to here it once to understand that we must be in grave danger; at least if we are to assume the worst.

Should we trust this return signal? Should we cover it up? Should we warn others? All these questions were weighing so heavily on the mind. I had never smoked a cigarette before in my life but if there was ever a time I needed one, it was now. I felt strongly that we needed to act but who's going to listen to a sister satellite station of NASA located in the middle of nowhere USA? Obviously we knew the right thing to do would be to at least try and warn the others even if they laughed in our faces.

So, we began to set about a marketing strategy that we would pitch to the U.N. council to get them to listen. Ultimately we decided to market this as the end of the world unless we headed the stranger's call. One might say we were blowing this out of proportion, but we felt like didn't have much time. We needed something that would catch their attention.

So as we began to make the call, we were surprised to find people responding well to our message. We were able to land an emergency meeting with the council within two days. I was both relieved to get the message out and intimidated by now having to present this to some of the most powerful people on the planet. I don't get paid enough for this kind of stress!

But alas, I feel confident in our ability to get the message out. With the United States government and NASA behind our plans, we have massive firepower and a large budget to work with. We don't necessarily know how to ""play dead"", but we'll think of something. So far we've come up with blacking out the country for a few days but we'll see. Obviously the American people aren't going to like this, but I feel like lives are at stake here. The longer we wait, the greater the chance of possibly being attacked by an unknown enemy.

So we'll see how it goes. In the meantime, I'm going to Sonic to grab a turtle pecan blast to take my mind off the stress. Don't wait up!

Trust the human race to think that the moment when alien lives would reveal themselves would be an awesome and epic occasion, giving rise to many Jeff Goldblum and Will Smith quotes. Instead, we get this: Shut up and play dead. I know what you’re thinking, it looks like it was written by a 3 year old who’s only experience with a computer is one of those “educational” fisher price laptops with thirty mini games on but only one your child will find actually enjoyable. But at least this unknown alien civilisation had the courtesy of translating their language into ours, which makes me wonder how long those aliens actually knew about us. 

But how does one approach such a vague message? There’s no context. We have no idea who sent it or if we can trust them. The powers of the world were split between thinking it would be best to do what the message says or think it be some kind of dirty trick. The problem was the decision to go dark had to be unanimous. There’s no point spending billions of dollars going into hiding underground if the rest of the world won’t join you. 

After long months of debate, a metal rod from outer space crashed into the Pacific Ocean, creating large tsunamis that killed thousands of people. The ISS managed to photograph it and saw that it came from deep space, far beyond the reaches of human space travel.

The world powers saw this as a wakeup call and began a world-wide project to get all nine billion people living happy lives under the Earth. 

It took years. Every day could’ve been the last day. But still the world worked, every single person on the Earth helped in some way. It was the first time the entire Earth banded together. Even poverty ridden places like pretty much all of Africa heavily recovered. The idea to move underground was a great decision for places like the Congo and Liberia. Because now they had funding from the rest of the world. Despite the impending threat of an unknown alien race, the world was more united than ever… as cringe-worthy as it sounds. 

And so the human race began anew, as moles essentially. Living most of their life underground and occasionally popping up. But moles aren’t popping up to look for deadly aliens from space that will kill them if they don’t try to camouflage themselves against the vastly spanning black canvas which is our universe. Yeah moles just pop up for shits and giggles really. 

For years and years the human race existed under the ground. After the first couple of decades all the different countries’ mass bunkers had been linked some way or another. After the first century the idea of countries was considered pointless and was dropped altogether. We all simply lived in Earth. Everyone was slowly becoming one giant, eleven billion wide community. And all the racists and sexists and homophobes and other types of twat were running out of things about a person to call inferior, so they eventually just stopped being assholes. Earth was becoming quite the Utopia.

BUT THEN DISASTER STRUCK

People just went missing all of a sudden. A boy there, a woman here. Nothing out of the ordinary. Then gradually more and more people at a time. Whole groups, communities. Gone within a night. Soon the Earth sprung into chaos. They weren’t safe anymore. 

But, when reviewing the missing person cases, it was found that each person who went missing all went missing in the same place: Outside the bunkers.

Funny that.

For whatever reason, each person had an incentive to go outside. Each person that went outside gave their family and friends an incentive to go outside. Which spread to more people and more people and more. So what was the world powers response to all these people going missing in the outside world? What did the humans do? Unmatched in intelligence by any other being on this world or the next, what did this advanced, amazingly smart civilization decide to do? They sent more people outside.

Genius.

Whole armies and search parties went missing. Millions at a time. The human populous was whittled down to the last few. On one fateful night, all across the world. Explosions rang out across the areas where the last remaining humans were. That night, everyone was taken. Everyone in the world.

They were taken by an alien race. These aliens were at least eight feet tall and green. They had three arms and five legs and their big beady eyes were clutched between large antennae. The humans were taken across galaxies on the alien ships in a matter of minutes to a large green world. The alien race landed in a field the size of the world itself. And laid out on that field were thirteen billion reasonably comfortable chairs. One for each member of the human race. It took seven weeks to get every human sat down in a chair. The aliens were rather nice about it. Each one of the at least forty billion aliens there spoke reasonably good English and understood that humans wanted to sit with friends and families. Once the process was completed, large television screens were placed in front of people. It was made sure that every single person could see a screen.

The screen turned on to reveal an aliens face, and it spoke thus: “Today, on the Splonks of Nush, it is the Succ of our great Flump. That means it is the birthing date of our great prince. I present to you Flump (Prince) Flogboth Noncy Flub Dungawung.” 

So it turned our alien stereotypes were pretty on the dot.

Another alien, draped in orange robes came onto the screen and smiled malevolently at the human race. After a long silence, the alien prince said to the frightened people of the planet Earth, “Found you!”

Yep. We spent four hundred and thirty seven days playing a game of intergalactic hide and seek.

When the aliens were asked why they did this to us, they said that the ponce of a Prince, Flogboth, was bored of every birthday he had where he got everything that anyone else ever wanted.
Apparently that isn’t enough.

So instead, the great powers of the alien world got Flogboth, for his birthday, a big hide and seek game. They showed pictures and documentations of the human race and told him to, essentially, “fetch.”

This made the stuck up prince happy. The same can’t be said for the humans.

When Earth got that singular message that we never expected, it took a decade for the most brilliant minds ever born of every living generation of human to figure out it wasn't some returning signal that some snot-nosed script kid had sent out as a hoax. Not, it was genuine, an actual real transmission from what we could only assume was intelligent life somewhere else.

It took another five years for Earth to collectively agree to the request. There managed only to be three wars about it, which was impressive. It seemed that one people finally found out this wasn't some conspiracy, there was more fear than anything. People who had always touted on about the excitement of finding life spent money on survival, building bomb shelters before the government allowed big machinery. Satellites were left in the sky, but the signals were turned off, buildings that reached into the skies were abandoned faster than the third Wall Street plunge had people jumping out of buildings. Cults grew rapidly, and kool-aid was dished out accordingly, the compounds themselves becoming mass graves. But where humanity shows its worse, the best also comes through.

Those who were able to unite and work together found camaraderie that the Earth had never seen, and the last messages sent through phone lines, the internet, Morse code- just about any form of telecommunication were mostly filled with love and care and hope rather than anger and hate. Gasoline was no longer created, oil wasn't pulled from the ground, and it quickly became illegal to even drive a car. Before the electrical grids were turned off, there was a year of survival training given to everyone who signed up for it. They were taught how to make their own clothing, how to use rudimentary tools to create buildings if need be, how to plant crops and cultivate them properly, how to raise animals, and even the basic medical knowledge that would help the population not die on a normal basis.

And then the world went dark. Save for a single base on Antarctica which constantly accepted signals and bounced them to a dozen devices given to world leaders that were undetectable and virtually unknown outside that inner circle.

It took fifteen years, but the Earth finally went dark. Seemingly dead to the rest of the universe.

At first it was hard, and people died in droves from problems that would have been simply and easily cured previously. To locations that experienced winters, that first year was harsh. People still were getting the knack of this new life. There were no flu shots that were easy to get like before, and doctors were such a rare commodity that illness that didn't cure usually lead to death. It was funny in a sad way that someone could die from a splinter as easily as they could from starvation because they hadn't planned their crops correctly.

But humans had always been amazingly adaptable, and where there was a will there was a way- and there was always a will. Human life didn't flourish by any means, and it was estimated that the population took a serious nose-dive. But along the way people got used to it, their muscles became strong from working the land, and their respect for nature grew, and when they looked up into the sky those who had grown up in the city finally saw the true beauty of the universe, and they'd find themselves crying simply because of the wonder they'd never known of.

Eventually the original signal was all but forgotten, and like healing an old scar, the Earth renewed itself. Forests swallowed cities, and Mother Nature took care of herself and of her children. Some people reasoned that maybe this was how it was meant to be, and they looked back on the industrialized nations as something disgusting, a blemish of history in which everyone had forgotten what it truly meant to be human. This new life felt more real, and in general was considered good and healthy.

It took 123 years for  new signal to come through. The oldest person on Earth at that time was 103, and their old memories only had the inkling memory of a life in which constant noise always existed. The base on Antartica received the message, and it took a month to translate properly before it was sent automatically to the devices that had been passed down to leaders that could be trusted to take the message to their grave if need be.

When they saw it, what the message was, seven of them smashed the devices, three of them killed themselves, and the remaining two thought it was a cruel joke. In blinking letters on a screen in a base that was only reachable through the harshest boat trips read two words.

"[WP] For years Earth cried out to an empty cosmos, searching the stars for echoes of life. From the middle of nowhere, a reply finally comes: ""Shut up, and Play Dead!""",Crapletunnel,"Mass Effect is actually a game, not a book. They're entirely different races from different parts of the galaxy, so their longevities are naturally different. Just like how a turtle can easily live for +150 years, but the average death age for most people is only around 80.

The reason given for the [Salarians](http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Salarian) was that they had very fast metabolisms, and everything they did was essentially sped up - Other races seemed sluggish to them, because our ""normal"" speed was their ""slow"". They would eat more often, sleep more often, (but for shorter periods of time,) talk faster, etc...

On the other hand, the [Asari](http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Asari) were an entirely female race who could live for upwards of 1200 years, barring unnatural deaths. There isn't a reason given for their extreme longevity, but if it's anything like earth's, it's simply a matter of how quickly their telomeres shorten - Think back to high school biology, and the section on DNA. The telomere is a section of genetic material at the end of the chromosome, which simply repeats itself over and over again. In humans, that pattern is TTAGGG. Every time a cell divides, the chromosome is ""unzipped"" and replicated. During that replication, some genetic material is lost. The telomere is a essentially ""cap"" on the chromosomes, which provides a buffer of material that can safely be lost, (since it's simply a repeating pattern...) But the drawback is that they get smaller and smaller as you age and your cells continue to replicate and lose more material. Eventually, your cells begin to run out of ""extra"" DNA, and that leads to all sorts of age issues like cancer and organ failure. Maybe they are just born with extremely long telomeres. Or maybe they shorten slower because of their unique mating habits. Or maybe they have a different pattern/pattern length, which is more resistant to genetic deterioration.",Mic_Check_One_Two

After his full pardon for all crimes, Dr. Edward Franklin has been nominated as the Human representative in all technological trade negotiations with a near-unanimous vote (4,798 in favor, 1 abstaining.) Although Humanity has very little to offer in the way of new developments, many species are willing to ""invest in the potential/promise/future/return for Humanity/Humans/Hominids/Apes to contribute to the universe/black sphere/emptiness in the future/after/end-of-all.""

Mercifully agreeing to use speech enhancement, Dr. Franklin made a statement earlier today. ""After much consideration, we have agreed to work only with those groups which espouse the same values we as a species hold. Freedom. Leadership as a service to those we govern. Limitations to protect the incalculable value of individual choice. We will broker no deal with anyone that requires that we serve them, or that we subsume ourselves to a greater whole.""

""Humanity has so much to learn from our brethren beyond the stars. With the expert help of learned men across many disciplines, it has become my duty to discuss what knowledge will best assist our humble species in joining the chorus of voices across the universe. First in our discussion were technologies to improve our agriculture and energy development. These enhancements alone will vault our knowledge far beyond our wildest dreams. No longer will we live in an era of scarcity and want.""

""But that... is only the beginning."" Dr. Franklin continued. ""The most valuable technology we will be entrusted with is that of the knowledge of knowledge. Analytical programs capable of machine learning. Software that can filter our collective brilliance, constantly testing and proving our ideas and solutions. We will be given the tools to solve our own problems. Soon, Humanity will be able to enhance all life, everywhere, with our own unique creativity and ingenuity. We will raise ourselves to a higher level than we ever thought possible.""

""It's... astonishing"" A high-level academic programmer shared with us under conditions of anonymity. ""These programs recursively learn from every assessment. Every cycle through past, current, future events - it tests itself constantly. After a few hundred cycles, it's successfully predicted every swing of the stock market for the last week. I can't even begin to parse the code. It modifies itself to better respond to new data."" &lt;Tap Here&gt; for a discount code on our newest course: Self-Enhancing Recursive Machine Learning for Dummies.

Spurred by the infusion of new technologies, humanity seems poised to enter a new golden era. Endeavors that were once beyond our capabilities are fast underway.

""So... You really want nothing in return?""

""In the universe/wholeness/marketplace, there is only one currency. Reputation/honor/notice. You have none. But if our assistance/guidance/product leads to your development/creation/synthesis of something new, your reputation will add to our own. You are not the first beings we have given these gifts. You will not be the last.""

""How, um, how do we know it's safe? It seems too good to be true. We can't, uh, analyze this code. It's beyond our best minds.""

""How suspicious/untrusting your species is! We will ignore/forget/decline this distrust/dishonor/insult. Our biggest competitors/challengers/rivals are the Gl'lk Tak hive-mind developers. We will provide you with their wavelength if you wish/request/demand. If there is anything in our products that do not do as we say, they will happily/gleefully expose that to you.""

These translated discussions were giving Eddie a pounding headache. Words have so many subtleties, and the best any algorithm can do is to try to provide the closest approximation. He had tried to research the history of this ""reputation"" concept, but it led down a rabbit hole of history and ancient alien tales. Even context requires context.

He consulted his entangled tablet. A roomful of experts were watching every second of this, and feeding him advice. The Olyan representative floated patiently on his screen, the shapeless body glimmering in a rainbow of translated infrared. A colonial species that evolved around geothermal vents on an exoplanet had a very different concept of light and vision. Eddie wondered what they actually looked like in the visual spectrum. *Probably pale, like some sort of cave fish.*

""I, uh, apologize if I insulted you. We are also speaking with the Gallak- uh, Gl'lk Tak. They have nothing but honorable things to say about you.""

""We are pleased/satisfied/honored to hear that. The Gl'lk Tak also act with honor/reputation. We believe/know/trust that our product is better/superior/above theirs. But there will be no insult/dishonor if you choose their product instead.""

""No, your product is more... compatible? Does that word translate?""

""We understand/absorb your meaning/context/idea.""

""Oh. Good. It's more compatible with our technology. We use binary systems too. We, uh, thank you for this gift. Whatever small honor we have, we... offer to you gratefully.""

The Olyan flashed a shade of blue. *Is that good? Blue means more heat. Is it blushing? Or angry? Did I offend it? The last thing we need is a repeat of the Carstonan fiasco. How was I supposed to know I was staring at its genitals? They looked JUST like eyes.*

""We are honored/flattered/pleased."" *Oh, good. Blue is good.* ""We will transmit the product/program/code now. Live/swim with honor, Ed-ee.""

The screen went dark suddenly. Apparently, Olyans were not ones for long goodbyes.

Eddie sank into his chair. What had he gotten himself into? What had humanity gotten into? So many rivalries and alliances. Humans get a pass for now, but they're going to need to learn how to swim with the big fish. *Heh, swim with the big fish. Cute, considering you just talked to an alien man-o-war.*

""I need a break. How much time until the next meeting?""

His screen came to life with a beep. ""You have 4 hours before the next meeting with the Ertrarian representative regarding solar biofuel production systems.""

*Great. Aren't they some kind of symbiotic algae/insect things? God, I hope they don't have pedipalps.* ",Mrcreation

"[WP] For years Earth cried out to an empty cosmos, searching the stars for echoes of life. From the middle of nowhere, a reply finally comes: ""Shut up, and Play Dead!""",Crapletunnel,"No one spoke over the gentle hum of the elevator. Six people had crammed into the slim steel cylinder and been made to leave their aides on the ground.  Some looked nervous,  others annoyed,  but none looked pleased. Being told to join the president of the Union of Nations in his private villa's rooftop greenhouse with five other important figures with no explanation would always be either pointless or somber. David Garrett,  head of the American exploration union seemed to be the most out of place,  and his appearance had darkened the others faces. David knew only 3 of the 5- Shelly Wilcox, Prime minister of the lunar colony was the only one he had ever spoken to privately. He knew Grant Thenn and Jeung Bo Lee by reputation; respectively as a brilliant moral economist and a godless socialist thug who had engineered an annoyingly rapid economic recovery. The other two where slim,  androgynous and wearing the sort of perfect business suit you didn't see outside of the capital trade committee. David guessed they were of the CTC's elite,  primarily based on the murderous looks they would throw in Jeung Bo Lee's direction. 

The doors of the elevator opened without a sound, and all were hit by a wave of hot humid air. Layers of plants rose in ordered ranks,  small tropical flowers to towering palms created a canyon of tangled green,  at the end of which a silhouette sat by a pool. There was a gentle rush of water and an occasional twitter of birds. The couple from the CTC left first,  taking off with long elegant strides. President Thenn and President Lee followed,  conversing in deep mutters. David followed Mrs. Wilcox,  who did not seem in a conversational mood. The air became more stifling as they grew closer to the pool in the center. The whole place was under a massive dome,  with glass so thick it required huge steel braces between the panels. As they walked,  David noticed they were followed by a pair of guards in lumpen gray suits with small golden lapel pins. Even though gold was a precious resource to the spacefaring community, the president still set a aside some to demarcate his personal guard, the selfish git. 

President Mungabe,  of the neo-African Republic that was once the Sudan sat on a low bench near the waters edge. He was not a man you'd call a selfish git to his face,  being a 6'5"" former combat medic for the Sudanese army. He let his long fingers play across the waters surface.  He had a look of composure, a look that suited none of the people who had come. There was a moment, 6 people standing in a semi circle,  in silence. President Thenn was the first to break the silence. 

""I have a cabinet meeting to discuss the trade partnership you proposed very soon, so I'd prefer to get this meeting done sooner rather than... ""

Mungabe silenced Thenn with a gesture, an open palm raised to eye level. He then fixed his gaze on each of the assembly in turn. David felt a strange cold when the presidents eyes locked on his for long moment. He then turned his gaze back to the water. 

""you see a fish on the sea floor.  It is flat,  and the color of sand.  It digs itself in to the silt to all but vanish. "" 

He reached down into the water, and with a flurry of dust a flounder swam off towards the deeper part of the pool. 
 
"" it hides,  because there is always a bigger fish. ""

The President rose to his full height, his eyes now full of naked fear. Terror swept over the assembly, this would not be good news. 

"" As soon as possible, we will be suspending further exploration beyond our solar system. We will be deactivating any signals sent beyond our solar system. We will begin the long process of disassembling both the lunar colony and the Martian research stations.""

Everyone immediately erupted in protest. Presidents Thenn and Lee roared about anti-scientific religious bigotry, Wilcox stammered about the herculean effort of building the colony in the first place, Commissioner Garrett fired off accusations of greed and ill will, and the members of the CTC espoused the enormous costs associated with all of this. For what seemed like an hour shouts and diatribes blended together until President Mungabe raised another hand for silence. 

""the Union of Nations has a very close connection to its space agency. This was a priority of our union for as long as it has existed, and subtle study of the stars will continue.  However,  at 3:47 GMT, one of our massive array receivers orbiting concurrent to Jupiter received a signal.""

Stunned faces slackened, and disbelieving eyes looked from person to person. 

""the signal originated from a section of space that appears to be utterly devoid of anything. No stars, planets,  nothing capable of being seem by our sensor arrays. The signal is extremely strong, and brief. It will reach sensors in orbit in a few hours. It is encoded binary, that can be read easily once we sorted out its structure. It's a message.  And if it's faked, it's an impressive job,  as everyone I've spoken to about it has vouched for its authenticity.""

He raised a hand,  and a screen descended from the ceiling. The light above went dark as panel shields closed, and darkness swallowed the stunned six. There was static,  and then slowly an image appeared. A massively compressed video played, of a small dog.  It sat,  cooked it's head and then rolled on its back,  tongue lolling comically out of its mouth. The static began to rise in volume. Early footage of bombed out London,  empty of life. Aerial footage of flooded town,  building washing down stream. A  stream of photos from war,  the human form conspicuously absent from any of the photographs of wanton destruction. The slow crawl of the moon across the light of the sun during an eclipse. Then silence, and darkness. Then,  thunderous trumpeting electronic wails,  consistent in pitch but random in rhythm. They clamped their hands over their ears from the deafening sound. Then silence again. Then footage of a star, silhouettes of planets passing at unnatural speed. From the top,  though,  another shadow began to move,  a softly undulating mass  that would pass a planet,  then the planet would vanish. Once all had gone,  the form vanished.

The lights rose. The color had drained from the assembled faces. A soft whimper came from no one in particular. Mungabe broke the silence. 

""we deduced that footage was from a star near the galactic axis, and by our reckoning has been without satellites for almost a millennia. I believe we are no longer alone,  and I believe this was a very direct warning. A warning, in Morse code.  That was the meaning of those noises. A warning to play dead. """,enjolras1782

So when we got a message from another world, hoe could we not want to keep talking to it? But they only gave one message. ""Shut up and play dead""


There were those that wanted to follow the warning. They believed that if a species of another world gave us a warning to be silent, then it was a warning we could not ignore.

"[WP] A terminally ill patient meets an immortal, both of whom resent one another for their condition.",DJ_Incognito,"""Live a life worth living"" is the quote that always runs through my head, as it is  what I was taught as a child.  A life that you can look back on, and be proud of your actions on your death bed.  No one really thinks about it until they are near the end of their life, but the last thing that anyone wants on their death bed are negative thoughts of regret for not taking the chance.  Not asking that pretty girl out on the date, for not taking that business venture, for not chasing their dreams.  We are a species which either thrives on risks and adventure, or we quietly stew in our own mediocrity, never getting anywhere.  The only problem that I have with ""Live a life worth living"" is that mine never ends.  I have been living for at least a thousand years now, you lose count after a while.  Ever since I saw the movie Groundhog Day, I refer to my condition as the ""Groundhog Day Syndrome"" or GDS.  While I am not locked into a single day like Bill Murray, I will repeat a day if I die during that day.  
 
I made the discovery during war time.  I was killed on the battle field, only to awaken at the morning that I died.  At first I thought that it was a prophetic dream, but I realized years later that I never aged beyond the age of my first death, the age of 25.  After that realization, I decided that I would join the medical field, both to help others in need, and also try to discover the cause of my condition.
 
""*paging Doctor Roberts, you are needed on the 2nd floor.  Doctor Roberts, 2nd floor*"".  I work in a local hospital under the alias of Roberts, and I see death all the time working with terminally ill patients, a death that will never come to me.  
 
I braced myself, and walked into the room that I had been paged to.  
 
""Good morning Amanda, how are you feeling this Friday?""
 
""Morning doc.""

Amanda was nearing her last moments of life, as she was losing the battle with a rare form of cancer.  I hate to be that guy, but I envied her.
 
""Doc, you know, you are drop dead gorgeous. I would totally date you if you asked.  But I guess it's just not meant to be now is it?""
 
Her comment of drop dead gorgeous, while a compliment, stung in a way that she would never understand.
 
""I'm jealous of you doc, you have a career, a family, and a whole life worth living, while I sit here in bed, accepting the fact that I may not be here tomorrow.""
 
My *family* had been dead for centuries, and while I have many decedents, they don't know me.   
 
""It's not that simple Amanda.  I believe that there is a better place beyond this life, and you will reach it soon and be pain free."" 

""You believe in God doc?""

""... I do. I believe that there is a God, and He may be playing a cruel joke on me.  I have experienced all kinds of death, some that you could never comprehend, and yet here I am, here I remain.  Knowing that you will be gone in the next few days, I envy you.  I will never get to paradise, because I am stuck here, acting as the angel of death and shepherding those to something that I can never attain.  I envy you.  As an immortal, I envy all of you.""

""Doc, what are you talking about? An immortal? Have you gone crazy? ...Wait, it is certain, I only have days?""

""If that.  You will be knocking on heavens door soon, a door that I can never reach.""

""SCREW YOU DOC!""  I was surprised at the sudden outburst from Amanda. ""Screw you!  You're telling me that you are an immortal and I don't even get to experience my life?  I don't get to fall in love, start a family and grow old?  And yet you complain because you never reach a heaven?  If you really feel that way, then I am taking you with me! Screw you!!""

I'm not sure what happened after that, but I awoke, and it was Friday morning again.  I should deliver the news to Amanda a little more gently when I see her again.",Vintner42

"[WP] A terminally ill patient meets an immortal, both of whom resent one another for their condition.",DJ_Incognito,"Why was I here? Mortals are disgusting. So weak. So fragile. So, why was I here, watching this boy waste away in front of my eyes?

“Fuck you, you smug, immortal asshole! You don’t know anything about me! You don’t know anything about my pain!” he shouted, before his anger gave way to another coughing fit.

Once the coughing subsided, he glared at me. Or, he tried to glare at me, but he was weak from shouting. His rage had subsided, and all I could see left in his eyes was fear… Weakness.

I flinched and looked away.

He began speaking again, but quieter now. His voice had lost its previous passion. Now it only conveyed the tiredness of one that had given up. “There was still so much I wanted to do, you know? So much I still wanted to experience… I wanted to have a family, and be the best of fathers… like my father never was…”

I looked at him, but he had averted his gaze to the window.

“An immortal like you would never understand what it’s like to die with so many things undone. I bet by now you’ve done everything you could ever want. Seen everything there is to see.”

He was right of course; I would never know that pain. But, I also knew pain that he would never know. I had done everything, so there was nothing left to do. I had seen everything, but there was so much I wish I hadn’t seen.

“Look, I know you don’t want to hear it, but it hasn’t exactly been easy for me, either,” I snapped with a harshness I instantly regretted.

I took a moment to reign in my frustration before softly asking, “What’s your happiest memory?”

He looked at me warily, but decided to humor me. “When I was little, I got really sick. I couldn’t leave my bed for days, but mom took care of me. She made warm soup, and tucked me in at night. She read me stories, and played games with me when I got bored. Whenever I remember that time, a gentle warmth surrounds me, like the warmth of her hugs…”

‘That does sound wonderful,’ I mused to myself, as a I felt a heaviness overcome me.

I allowed him to bask in that memory a little longer before I finally spoke. “You know, I don’t have very many happy memories left. When you’ve lived as long as I have, you start to find yourself forgetting the earliest ones, and find that new ones are harder to come by.”

I gave him time to take in my words, and as he did, I saw him hesitate before he asked a question I’m sure he had been wanting to ask his whole life.
 
“Couldn’t you have made new ones with us…?” he asked, full of uncertainty. The vulnerability in his voice reminded me just how young he was.

I let out a heavy sigh. “I’m sorry… I’m so, so sorry… I was selfish. I’ve lost so many loved ones already. I can’t even remember their faces or the sounds of their voice. I was so afraid…”

“What were you so afraid of?” he urged. I could hear his desperation to understand.

I felt my eyes begin to water and a lump form in my throat. “I was afraid of my love for you and your mother… I loved you both so much that I was terrified at the thought of having to watch you die like everyone else I had ever known… so I ran.”

I barely noticed as I fell to my knees; my legs giving out under the weight of my greatest shame. I clenched my eyes shut, too afraid of what I might see if I looked at him.

“I ran because I didn’t want to experience that pain again… The hell of that despair…”

A few traitorous tears ran down my cheeks, but I made no move to wipe them away.

Unexpectedly, I heard a rustle of cloth, and I felt myself wrapped in a warm embrace as his tiny arms encircled my neck.

“I forgive you,” he muttered, words muffled by my shirt. I could feel a dampness growing on my shoulder.

“Why…?” I croaked.

“Because despite your fear and the pain you knew it would cause you, you still came back.”

No longer able to hold back, I wept like I hadn’t wept in centuries. I wasn’t sure why I was crying anymore; whether it was the remnants of the guilt I had carried for years, or the sheer elation from being forgiven, or the crushing sorrow of what was still to come, it didn’t matter. For now, all that mattered was the person I was holding. My beautiful, mortal son.

Some say it destroys a parent's life to see their child die, but when your great grandson's son dies, it really hits you hard. I'm surrounded by my family, but a certain person to my left is catching my attention greatly. He lies in a wheelchair, with a nurse sitting next to him. He is the deceased' brother.

This man is so fortunate for what they call a 'condition'. I decide to see what it's like from someone with experience. I quickly slither through the seats, to find an empty seat beside him.
""Hello young man,"" he mutters, obviously deceived by my appearance. I lean next to his ear and whisper,
""I am older than anyone you ever knew.""
Unsurprisingly,mths man is taken aback. I continue my speech,
""I am an immortal. Please tell me what it's like to be mortal.""

The man obviously didn't believe me, but played along.
""It's horrible, I'm in constant pain and my inevitable fate is fast approaching. My family is crying and this funeral is a harsh reminder that we will eventually die, and it will most likely not be a peaceful death. And you?"" His response can't be true, it has to be great to still be surrounded by people you grew up with. I decide to tell him my pains.
""I haven't seen my mother for 300 years.""

""I don't understand.""

""Beauty is of the moment,"" the being continued, his jealousy growing as the man's final heartbeat beeped on the monitor in the small room, ""Because you are sad, you can appreciate happiness.  Because you have difficulties, you can appreciate your accomplishments.  Because you will die, you can appreciate living.""

The aged man slowly turned his head towards the being, his aged skin almost a shade of grey as he struggled to breath.

""Fuck you,"" he muttered, ""Do you know why?""

The begin felt amused and shrugged its shoulders.  No matter what the man had said, it surely couldn't have changed his mind.

""Speak.""

""You're fucking immortal,"" the man drew his final breathe, ""You can play video games in the future through virtual reality.""

The monitor flattened as the realization hit the being like an anvil.

Her cold smile was a knife in my heart, her voice a punch to my gut. *God must have a very twisted sense of humor,* I thought, staring off into the space above her flowing blonde hair. *Why does she get to live, forever young and beautiful, while I have to waste away and die?*

""Hey, Maria,"" the bitch said, passing for timid for the first time in her life. ""How are you doing?""

I looked away, refusing to answer. She knew perfectly well how I was doing. Between the IV and the tracheostomy, there were so many clues that even she, with her head full of air, should know how I'm doing.

""Listen, I just wanted to come see you. I flew in as soon as I heard–""

Now *that* was rich. ""Save it,"" I spat, still looking away. Of the list of people I'd *pay* to leave me alone in my final hours, she was decidedly at the top.

""I just thought–""

""Oh you *thought,* huh? That's a first! When have you ever *thought* in your entire perfect life? You waltzed and smooth talked and batted your eyes through every little thing life threw at you! You seduced a millionaire, dropped out of college, and spent the past fifty years jet-setting around the world! And the perfect fucking *icing* on the perfect cake of your life? You haven't aged a fucking *day* over twenty! Nothing seems to hurt you, you never get sick, and here *I* am, dying of brain cancer! Me, who busted my *ass* for everything, who worked nights to pay for my degree, who spent long hours working in a lab, doing research on the thing that would, ironically, end up killing me! Tell me,"" I said, bringing my voice down to a menacing whisper, ""how that's fair.""

She stared at me for a long while, tears in her eyes. *Good,* I thought. *She'd better be sorry.* She picked up her purse and coat and headed for the door. Just before she left, she turned around.

"[WP] A terminally ill patient meets an immortal, both of whom resent one another for their condition.",DJ_Incognito,"Across from me he lounged, resplendent, pouring himself his fifth glass of wine. Meanwhile, I struggled to handle the water pitcher, stray droplets spilling across my old t-shirt as the tremors wracked my hands. Only one of us would have a hangover to nurse tomorrow morning, and how this upset me. He tilted his head to look at me with a pasted smile. Perhaps the same thought just crossed his mind as well.

His spiteful gaze never wavered as he perched a cigarette between his teeth and pulled out a lighter. I scooted my chair back an inch, hoping that it would reduce my smoke intake, even if only by a margin. How fair it was that I was a slave to my own shell of a body, and he was his own's cruel master! Smoke began to fill the room, mingling with the trails of steam emanating from the massive t-bone propped in front of him. In the past, I may have likewise indulged myself, but today, my body insisted that it wasn't hungry.

We were similar men who had worked similarly hard to earn our similar keeps, and that could have made us friends. Yet I loathed him for the one blessing he possessed over me, and he spited me in return. How could he torment me so? All his wounds would heal; all his self-inflicted damage would be undone, automatically and without a trace. He envied me anyway; he hated me for my scars, the one thing I had over him. Nonetheless, it was a ridiculous notion. What good are scars when your entire body is one?

A knock sounded on the door. No doubt his companions had arrived to take him for a night out. He abandoned his half-eaten steak and strode for the door; I followed to lock it behind him. As he shouldered his jacket, he turned to appraise me. A hint of wistfulness flickered in his eyes for a moment. Perhaps it was the sympathy I so craved from him. More likely, it was his own selfish sadness, a product of the unwarranted resentment he held towards me for so long. 

Regardless, the moment passed, and the expression departed. When he said goodbye to me, it was cold and formal. I returned his handshake in kind, refusing to show any weakness. Once the door was shut, though, I felt a pang of regret. Our final interaction was a scar that would never heal, and I was the one who had to live with it.",hideouts

""Yknow,"" he murmured ""your the lucky one.""
With his other hand he began to chew his nails, yet his gaze never left the outside world. The other figure in the room, a bald man about the age of 20 lay crippled in a hospital bed, radiation was immenent throughout his body, death was near. ""Oh yea?"" The other man, Gary, replied
""How so?"" 
As he said this he arched his eyebrow, giving an inquisitive look
""Well..."" The chair man said ""your moving on, finally you'll know the answer...""
""Tha answer!"" Gary interrupted, ""I'm in so much pain I can't even move, fuck the answer!""
""Haha, you don't understand do you?"" The man replied, his gaze pitiful, but hinted with jealousy ""life was never about life, the true game was all in the end....

""Well then I'd be envious, eternal peace would be a blessing, I'm damned in the world of the living, just as your dying now, the world, the universe even will soon follow, but I'll still be here, still alive""

""Don't you know, knowledge is power, and I'll never know the greatest question?""
""Yea"" Gary chuckled ""and I'll be dead, you know what fuck you, here I am literally about to be extinguished from the finite existence I get, the one astronomically small chance I get to live and i wasted it, but you.... Oh you get all the time you want, don't you get it, your fucking eternal!""

The nurse and doctor kept their expressions tight. ""I'm sorry sir... the operation was a failure. We've tried... everything. Nothing works. It's best you just accept it and try to find a way to cope.""

Tears filled his eyes and he blinked, wiping them away. ""Thank you... doctor. I tried for so long but I should have known it was impossible. There's truly no hope.""

The doctor shook his head slowly. ""I'll leave you alone here. Nurse, come along. Let's leave him be.""

The doctor and nurse left the man alone. His thoughts blurred and raced. It had taken so many treatments, so many tests, and in the end it yielded nothing. There was no hope for his condition.

""What are you so sad about?"" asked a voice from the other side of the room. He looked up. The voice belonged to a teen girl, probably no older than twenty. ""What are you in for?""

""Ah... it's nothing."" lamented the man. ""There's no cure for my condition. They've tried everything. _I've_ tried everything.""

""Yeah, but what are you suffering from? It doesn't look like cancer. Your body looks healthy. You even have some muscle mass so it can't be leukemia. What's your condition?""

""My condition..."" the man sighed... ""I have tried to die for so many years. I've been stabbed, decapitated, burned alive at the stake, buried alive, and even with this new modern medicine science can't find a cure for my condition. I'm doomed to live this way for the rest of my life. Which is probably eternity.""

""What?!"" her eyes narrowed. ""You mean you're crying because... you can't die? What a joke! That kind of thing can't exist!""

""It's no joke."" he murmured, staring at the cold tile floor as he sat forward. ""I've tried everything. We even tried blasting my body with exotic particles. Nothing works.""

""No, damnit! I mean being immortal! You mean to tell me you have the ability to live forever, achieve all your wildest hopes and dreams, and you're complaining? I have news for you, sir, I'm terminally ill. I'm going to die before I'm 25 and probably sooner than that. I never got to ask out the guy I liked.

If there is a god, he delights in tormenting me!""

""A god... yes, he is truly a villain."" the man clutched his chest. ""You speak of dreams. What good are dreams when you have nobody to share them with? You speak of children. What good are children when you'll outlive their furthest descendants? You have the beauty of never having to see civilizations rise and fall, never watching as the world collapses around you. I do not. I will be here long after the last human perishes.""

Her expression softened. ""You... you're right. I'm sorry. I didn't realize. You truly have the saddest existence. To have everything, and yet nothing. Such a life is not worth living.""

"[WP] A terminally ill patient meets an immortal, both of whom resent one another for their condition.",DJ_Incognito,"James looked across his room. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. It had been six months since the diagnosis. Cancer. Brain to be exact. He had about a year to live. He was 22, just out of college. He had no family, no friends, no lovers. ""Well, at least no one will be sad when I'm gone."" He looked over to the double barrel shotgun in the corner. ""No. Not yet""

He heard some knocking at the door. He brushed it off, until he heard a loud bang. James got out of his bed, taking the shotgun out of the corner. He went to the source of the noise. James found that his door had been broken into. He began looking all over his house. He than felt something hit his head, and fell onto the floor.

James found himself in a corner, with his hands tied. ""Don't move you fuck"", said a voice in front of James. He felt something cold against his temple. 'What do you want?"", James said, rasping. ""I want a place to crash. Unfortunately, you were the only place for miles. The cops are probably looking for my ass."", said the man. ""Why don't you just take my car?"" said James. 'Because they have a picture of me. They'll find me if I go on the road"". 

It felt like hours, with James just sitting on the floor, with the barrel against his forehead. ""You have cancer?"" said the man. ""yes"" said James, depressingly ""I do, brain to be exact"". ""Why don't, you know, off yourself, or something"" said the man, confused. ""Don't have the balls, you know. I just don't have the guts to do it. I want to die, but I can't"", said James. ""Sorry, I know what its like to want to die"" said the man. ""What do you mean?"" said James. 

James felt a hand on his shoulder turn him around, to in front of the man. He was older, around in his 20's or 30's. He had long brown hair, which was about to his neck. The man held a revolver to his head and pulled the trigger. James closed his eyes, but he felt some blood land on his face. The gunshot was loud, which made James deaf for a moment. ""What the fuck?"" yelled James. James opened his eyes, seeing the bloody head off the man. Blood was all over him. But then, something strange happened: the blood started moving back into his brain. The blood James had felt on his face was moving back as well, right in front of him.

Within 10 minutes, all the blood and flesh that was originally on the floor or on each others bodies, were back on his head. The mans body began to regenerate and twitch. James was amazed. ""Is this my imagination? Did I go insane? Did I blow my brains out earlier today and this is my personal hell?"" Then James heard a voice. ""See what I mean?"" said the man. ""I'm immortal. I can take anything. Bullets, metal, bombs, knives, anything"". 

""Great, not only do I have to wait for my death, but I get to see what I want. Immortality"" James said to the man. ""Well sorry, motherfucker. You're one lucky motherfucker, you get to die, you get to die instead of living on this hell hole for ever. I got to see everyone I cared about die right in front on my eyes. I saw my daughter die at the age of 92."" said the man. ""At least you had a fucking family."" said James. 

James and the man looked at each other with hatred. They were looking at the thing that they wanted. One was death, the other to be alive forever. James began to cry. ""Just... just kill me, I don't want to live like th-"". Before James could finish that sentence, he heard a loud bang, and fell to the floor. ""Thank... you....""

The bartender, smiling came by to the man.

""How can I help you?”

“Pour me another will you.”

“Will it be cash or card?”

He slipped a 100 dollar bill on the table.

""Keep the change but, let me have the bottle.""

""Sure have it, but let me ask you something. You got a wife and kids?”

“I did but…?”

The bartender cut him off.

“Let me tell you something”, said the bartender. “I’ve seen enough people in this bar wasting their lives away staring down the glass. Trust me when I say go home to your wife and kids, you don’t know how much they love and miss you.”

Irritated the man said, “Just give me the bottle and leave me alone.” 

“Ok” the bartender said cooperatively and he left without saying another word.

He knew the bartender wouldn’t understand. He was bitter at the world for how his life turned out. He was divorced and lost custody of his children and now with death by the door, he wished he could relive his life.  

He lit a cigarette and he thought to himself, ""At least I'll live to see the end of the bottle and the end of the pack."" 

And he drank himself into oblivion.

Waking up the next morning the man woke up with a pounding headache. Reorienting himself to relieve the pain he saw he was in a huge bed with silk sheets. He sluggishly pulled himself out of the bed and looked out the windows to see he was in a high rise apartment. The city shined beautifully in front of the morning sun and he almost forgot about the headache, but the moment was disrupted by a knock on the door.

 “Can I come in?”

“Uhmm….wait”, the man touched up his hair in front of an imaginary mirror and tried to look as if he didn’t just roll out of bed.

And a moment later he said, “Yea come in.”

A familiar face came through the door and the man recognizing the bartender, was surprised.

“You?!? Did you bring me here?”

“Yes I did. Welcome to my home. I picked you up after you drank yourself into a hole. I hope you enjoyed yourself.”

“uh…”

“Let me cut to the chase. I know you’re dying; however, don’t worry I am not the reaper come to take you away.”

“How’d you…” he said shocked

“Like I said I’ve known many people like you.” 

“Then you know it was a waste of your time and energy. Thanks for taking care of me but, I think I’m going to leav…”

“STOP” said the bartender commandingly, “and SIT DOWN! I’m tired of little shits like you who don’t know what you have!”

Startled, the man sat on the chair nearby.

After calming and gathering himself the bartender said, “I’ve done this for a long time now, maybe it is to hold onto my humanity, or the fact that by doing this I will find redemption somehow and earn my place in the dirt.”

“WHAT THE FUCK are you talking about man!” shouted the man

“I’m immortal” the bartender said apathetically, “and you don’t know how much I envy those who are able to meet death one day.”

The man offended said, “Fuck you! How dare you say something like this to a man who is dying! I’m fucking leaving!” 

But the bartender stood in his way. “Sit back down! I’m not done!” and he shoved the man.

The man enraged punched him in the face and said, “Are you looking for a fight, or does it make you happy to make fun of a dying man, you motherfucker!”

He kept punching repeatedly drawing blood. After a few minutes, his fists were red and arms tired.

Exhausted he stopped out of necessity, the cancer taking its toll, and sat on the ground, but upon stopping he came to the realization that the bartender never lifted his hands toward him. 

The bartender started to laugh on the ground. 

“What the fuck are you laughing at?”

 “Do you want immortality that badly?”  He asked rhetorically

“Of course you do, you want it like all men of this earth. From Gilgamesh to the conquistadors who sought the fountain of youth and the alchemists of old to cryogenics today. The difference is that I have achieved what all men of history desired. ” the bartender said proudly as he sat up.

“You’re finally calm, let’s grab a drink at my bar. What do you want?” said the bartender as he wiped away his blood

Surprised the man said cautiously, “you’re awfully nice for a guy who just got beat…”

The bartender said, “Can’t hit back at a guy who’s dying now can I? Now just answer the damn question.”

“The most expensive thing you got.” he said defeated

“Macallan 55 year old it is then.”

“What the hell! How does a bartender afford something like that let alone an apartment like this?!?”

“Like I said, I’m immortal.”

“Right…”

As he poured two glasses, the bartender began to say

“I’ve had the chance to fulfill all worldly desires. I have had sex with some of the most beautiful women, achieved wealth beyond my needs, consumed drugs to my heart’s content, eaten the best foods of the world, fulfilled my passions, was praised and worshiped by the people of this earth!”

The man responded tiredly, “You just keeping me here to brag about your imaginary life. Even if you were immortal, not saying that you are, but if you were tell me why you want to see death.”

He handed the man his glass and he took a sip.

The bartender stopped smiling and his eyes began to fill with sadness, “But you see people are so consumed and so focused with living forever that they fail to see what lies beyond that.” 

“You see, I once had a loving wife and child. A mother and father who loved me and I can’t even remember their faces….it’s been too long. Each day that passes I forget a little more of who they are and their kindness. I struggle to see and hear them. I miss the nagging of my mother, the stern look of my father, the smile of my child, and the touch of my wife. No amount of pleasure this Earth could offer me can overcome that. Nevertheless, even though I knew this, I tried to fill the emptiness with the things I mentioned before, until I couldn’t do it anymore because I could no longer feel sadness, happiness, or joy. I could only feel bitterness.” 

The bartender now visually frustrated, began to open up

“I am swimming beneath the ocean just below the surface gasping for a drop of air just out of reach that would give me breath of life! It may look like immortality has given me control of my life, but it’s rather the opposite, for I am at the whims of the storms of time being tossed around with no end in sight going from one place to another without rest, without a home. I fear once I lose them that I will cease to become human. Even passion has its limitations!”

 “It is natural and human to worry about death, it motivates you to live your life for those who you care for. Immortality takes away that worry, and thus you are no longer human. You lose your humanity to apathy, and living becomes suffocating!”

“So you see, to me living is dying and dying is living so that I can see my family once again.” Said the bartender

Now finishing his cup, the bartender said to the man, “So go home and be with the people that love you and live the rest of your life with purpose!”

As the man looked at the bartender, he didn’t know if the bartender was immortal but, he could see the sadness and the pain had left a broken man.

The man replied solemnly, “Maybe the alcohol is the reason why I’m telling you this, but I thought that if I could just relive my life to get a better job or do better by my children that my life would be better. Right now my wife and I are divorced and she took my children. I am scared that they hate me and I can’t win them back in the time I’ve got.”

The bartended said, “The thing about children is that they are children, even if you were a bad parent, they will still love you. It’s crazy how that works isn’t it. The love a child has for a parent is pure. As for your wife, she’ll come around as long as you put in effort to try your best to show that you still love her.”

The man simply stood up and left.

3 months later, the bartender stood afar looking at the man’s funeral.

Afterwards, the bartender left for his job back at the bar. As he was cleaning the cups, he hears the bell on the door ring. In walks a man, and he sits at the bar ordering a drink. The bartender wonders how much longer he has to live.

 	“So you’re telling me that... that this disease, that no doctor I have seen to in the last 4 months, has never heard of. Has happened to others, over five hundred years ago...and that You experienced it personally?” 
	The man sitting across from him took his hands out of his jacket and folded them on the table. “Yes, That is precisely it. I understand, it sounds absurd. I don’t know how, or why I do not age, but I don’t.” He waved off the one of the employees before they can ask if they needed anything.  “And the matter of the fact here, is that what you have now has a near one hundred percent mortality rate. I have had loved ones back in my small town in Ireland that have suffered the same symptoms. Hair falling off all over their bodies and red and black splotches all over their bodies. You’re immune system is failing and you have woken up with a film covering up your nose and mouth. Am I right?” 
	Steven stopped tapping his fingers and stared at the man in disbelief. He reached up and stroked his completely bald head, he then slowly clenched his hands into fists and slammed them down on the table. “How do you know this!” People around them all turned to look at the commotion, Steven lowered his voice before continuing, “Not even Jenna, my wife, knows about that.”
	“Like I said Steven, I have experienced this first hand. It’s something that plagued my small town over five hundred years ago. Everyone in that town died, except for me. And this is why I am here Steven. I am here to tell you that what you have, is terrible, and can not be stopped. The symptoms you have now are just the beginning, and they do not get any better. I suggest for the sake of yourself and all your loved ones that you make your farewells and find a nice cabin in the woods and have a short talk with a handgun. No one needs to suffer from what I have seen ever again.” The man said everything in a matter of fact tone and did not break eye contact with Steven for a second. 
	Steven said nothing as he stared at the stranger who is so calmly telling him to end his life, like he is ordering a pizza on the phone. 
	“I understand you have no right to believe a man that you have just met online. But everything I have said is true, and believe me. If I could trade spots with you I would do it in a heartbeat. I know every fiber of your being is telling you it’s wrong, but take it from me. Sometimes living longer is not what a person needs.”
	Steven opened and closed his mouth a few times before he spoke. “That must be so easy for you to say. You have been around the world. You have witnessed nearly every huge discovery and invention and the last millennia.” Stevens tone turned somber, “I am fucking twenty-seven man. I have barely even lived my life. I have not left this fucking city.”
	“You say that like it’s a terrible waste. If you have never had to watch your parents die before you, and everyone you get remotely close to fade away before your eyes. That’s a good life in my eyes.” 
The two men sat in silence for a while. The employees of the restaurant eyeing them, wondering when they were going to get out of their. The man in the jacket stood up and put his arm on Stevens shoulder. 
“I understand this is a lot to take in Steven. But please take heed to my words and make a decision, sooner rather than later preferably. If you need me, you have my email... I’m sorry Steven.” With that, the man in the jacket walked out of the restaurant. Steven sat still in silence for another good while before he got up, slightly chuckling to himself.

I awoke surrounded by resounding cheers and applause. 

*What have I done this time?* I wondered, feeling too tired to be dealing with such drama again.

But that was a lie. My body felt no aches or discomfort. If anything, I felt ready to spring onto my feet anytime. Instead, I sat up. 

Someone had put music onto the speakers. There might as well have been confetti swirling down. Everyone around me gave everyone else hugs and some of them were even dancing, but no one paid me any heed.

“I’m sorry,” came a voice. When I turned I realized there was that one guy who was cut off from all the celebrations. Probably the one guy no one liked or ever agreed with. It was tough being that guy, I knew.

“This,” he gestured towards the length of my body, “was the best that we could do for you.”

My eyes followed the arc that his hand drew. It was a whirring machine, matte black and elegant. It was my body now.

I felt faint at the sight. But that was not exactly true either. I *wanted* to feel faint, but my body did not allow it. I raised a hand to look at it. The joints made sounds that were not human. I stared at my palm then the back of my hand. I gripped my hand into a fist. It felt powerful.

“What happened?” I asked.

“Traffic accident. A truck knocked into you,” he said.

“Oh.”

“How do you feel?” he asked in return in an off-handed manner. He did not sound interested at all, but he was the only person whom I could talk to right then.

“Pretty bummed out,” I replied. 

“It’s all in your head. We haven’t installed the emotion feedback system yet. Y’know, the electronic equivalent of dopamine, serotonin or adrenaline. So technically, you aren’t feeling anything just yet.”

I could see why he was that one guy.

“Testosterone?” I asked.

“Yep, that too. But no, you will never have another kid.”

“I never had any to start with.”

“Yeah well, you won’t have any ever then.”

*Can I test out my sleek new fist on this guy already?* But I swallowed down my figurative anger. 

“Could there have been something else that you could do? I didn’t authorize this! You should have just let me die! Is this really the best that you could do?” Before I knew it, I was yelling. The music continued to play, but the people around me stopped to stare.

“Well, the best thing to do would have been to send you to a hospital. But we’ve been looking for a near-death person for a long time. There was this huge debate among us, well, between me and everyone else, but in the end they still went ahead. Since it was our truck that was full of spare parts that had hit you, it must be destiny.”

“Oh, Phil.” The air was silent. People assumed variations of the propping up their heads and faces with their hands. 

He stepped forward to hold my hand. “You may find it comforting to know that your entire digestive tract and both your hands came from that very truck,"" he said, nodding to himself.

""There must be another explanation for this,"" you tell yourself.",DeadComposer,"""There has to be another explanation"" I said, slamming my palms on the cool edges of the sink and dripping even more toothpaste on my shirt. I had been absentmindedly brushing my teeth for the last 45 minutes trying to understand what was happening to me. This was the third night in a row I had stayed up way too late arguing with the almost Unrecognizable man in the mirror. My eyes were bloodshot and my hair was in all different directions from being constantly pulled. 

Im a man who does not like to be wrong. I enjoy being in control. But seeing her was like the first drop on a rollercoaster. The feeling of getting your lungs emptied by an invisible force pushing mercilessly on your chest. The unexplainable, almost primal need, to scream. Fear and excitement. Now I couldn't get her out of my head. I was hooked. Finding awkward routes to my cube at work just to get a glimpse. Just to have my fix and just like an addict it's was constant cycle of trying to convince myself I don't need it and inevitably relapsing and feeling guilty and angry at the lack of strength. I'm sure people have started to notice. She never does.

She has an intense focus. Fierce. Like a lioness hiding in the brush. Except she's crunching numbers instead of gazelle. Ripping through excel sheets. She has no time to notice that I've taken the long way for my 7th trip to the bathroom since lunch. 

I get into the stall and sit down. I push my face into my palms as if that could push all
The thoughts of her out of my head. I start to wonder what kind of food she likes. If we like the same kind of movies. I start to think about my hopes and dreams and I wonder if they are the same as hers. The slam
Of the neighboring stall snaps me out of the rabbit hole and I prepare to do the walk of shame back to my cubical for the 7th time today. 

I walk out and glance up from my phone to see her standing right in front of me. She smiles and says excuse me. Her voice makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up and my eyes start to water. I feel as if I've opened a stove and the heat is blasting my face. I can barely get out a quick hello before starting to shuffle away. 

You idiot! I scream in my head. TALK TO HER. I feel something surging inside me and decide to turn around. I've finally decided enough is enough. Fighting every single nerve in my body I turn around. 

""Excuse me...I di.."" She was gone. She had disappeared into bathroom. I stood there with my heart beating out of my chest and a ringing in my ears. I walked back to my cubicle and sat in my chair. Adrenaline still pumping through my veins. I started thinking about all the things I could say. Hello my name is... How's your day...how's it going.. None of them sounded right. Maybe I'll  just wing it. Maybe tomorrow I would admit that I was wrong. 


I have no experience writing short stories or anything related to that but I saw this and figured I'd have fun. Any kind of criticism would be great.

"[WP] You and your SO perform a mind-switching experiment, but it doesn't go smoothly, and each of you ends up with the memories and knowledge of both.",DeadComposer,"  Nothing... it didn't work. the room stopped spinning, but I was still sitting in the red chair. The lab techs were running around yelling. 
  ""Hey Tim, are you in there?"" said a voice.
  It was Dr... What was his name?... Tompson?
  ""Tim can you here me?"" he said as he started messing with the head restraints.
  ""It didn't work! He's calling me Em!"" I heard someone yell.
  *BEEEEP* the room went black.

            ***

  'Coffee. I can smell coffee.' I heard myself think. 'They probably brought me to the med bay. I wonder if we both made it.'
  The room was dark, save for the lights from the displays above my head and across the room. I was laying on my back on a three by 7 bed with cott_white_en sheets. The room was designed to hold two patients_one door in the middle, enough room to access the beds, or when needed move them_facing each other and still have enough room for the equipment.
  ""Do I like coffee?"" Mumbled a voice. ""I know I did, but Tim can't stand... Couldn't stand the stuff.""
  The voice sounded like my brother, but he was halfway around the world. And under an ocean. Even if I had died he wouldn't hear about it for at least a week. And it would take months for him to get here.
  ""H-hel... Hello?"" I barely managed to whisper.
  ""God that's creepy"" said the voice. ""Do I really sound like that?""
  ""Who's there? Is Sarah alright?"" I was getting my voice back but it was still a little high.
  ""I don't know"" teased the voice. ""Are you alright dear?""
  ""My head hurts 'n I'm hungry... Hey Tim? You know the new guy I was telling you about? The one that makes a great Caramel Macchiato? If we've been out a day that means he's working. And I really want a coffee.""
  ""Tim?"" Tim sounded worried.
  Wait... Wasn't I Tim? 
  ""Yeah? What's wrong?"" I replied. Wait... ""Don't I hate coffee?""
  ""Uunng, how do you move this thing? Did you shove nails under your kneecaps?"" I heard my voice say.
  ""No, I have arthritis."" I squeaked back.
  ""Lemmie get the lights"" Said Tim as he started to move around.
  I looked at his display, it was the only thing I could actually see. It looked weird. On the screen there are fo_4 sections, each corresponding to different bodily systems. The Respiratory System was in the top left, with a blue background, then the Circulatory System in the top right, with a r_ed box, then the brain, with a green box and rest of the stuff in a yellow box. What was weird was the heart box and the brain box are normally the same colour; Red. I'd been telling her that I couldn't tell the difference, but now...
  *Click* lights. The walls of the room were swirling violet and pink, with dark purple as a base and white stars scattered around. Sarah called this the nebula room. She based it off o_I made this room look a picture Tim took with a telescope he made me.
  It had everything you need to keep someone alive right behind the walls. I had designed the room with_me so that if any of the tests went wrong_I had a place to bring the injured. There are six just like it on the other side of the door. Enough to support the maximum number of test subjects.
  And there by that door was Tim, The man I married five years ago.
  He was about six_5'11_, medium build_162 lbs._,Black hair_needs to shave. And I do look stupid with that grin.
  ""See? I was right, this room is kinda drab! Purple and grey!"" he teased.
  I giggled. Oh how much I loved that giggle.
  ""So which one of us am I?"" I asked.
  ""I'm not quite sure. If you're anything like me; a bit of both?""
  ""Most of both it feels like.""
  ""I hear ya"" said Tim in that way he always does.

            ***

  Voices were coming from room EMR #1! The lights are on! They must be awake!
  Emily burst into the room, heart racing.Tim was sitting on the end of Sarah's bed, and they were just... Talking. Like nothing happend. Like they didn't just both get their brains fried.
  She ran over to her brother and threw her arms around him. ""Y-you're okay!"" she stammered.
  ""Gees, you don't have to break ribs you know, I'm fine!""
  ""Wimp. How are you Sarah?"" Emily said, twisting Tim out of the way so she could see.
  Sarah looked at her, then at Tim. Tim's classic grin slid across her face.

""Jesus what the hell is this movie?""  I asked, placing my beer on the table with a little too much force.

""It's Alice in Wonderland, dude.""

""I know what movie it is, I was asking what the hell it is.  Look at it, there are two women here, both blonde, but one of them just slayed a dragon!  Which one of them is Alice?  Why is there a dragon in Wonderland?""

""Dude you are like so drunk.""

""I'm not that drunk.  I just want to know why there are two Alices and a dragon!""

""Do you want me to change the channel?""

""*God* no!  I love shitty movies!  I want you to find this movie on Netflix so we can travel down this rabbit hole together.""

""Pun intended?"" asked a woman standing by the couch.

The hardest part of moving on was forgetting.  Having her memories made it that much harder.  I remembered every shitty movie my ex and I watched together.  I remembered everything I ever said to her that she thought was funny.  I even remembered the look on this new girl's face.

I remembered believing in it.

""I mean everything I say, and say everything I mean,"" I replied, with faux seriousness.  I scooted over, grabbed the remote, and offered the girl a seat on the couch.

Then I took a long, deep drink of my beer.",0gl1tch0

Mother sighed and turned away. She always did this, standing with her back to my crib, her head bowing down, face caught in her palms. I whimpered, still unable to form words. Yet I sensed her distress, felt her pain.

Father came into the room, tall and dark, avoiding to even look at me. A week ago, he would stand besides my crib, two weeks ago he held me for the last time.

He stepped to Mother, pulling an arm around her in a silent embrace. She wept and pushed him away. ""I can't do this,"" she said.

""There is no other way,"" Father replied. ""If he stays here, he will die.""

""We can homeschool him. He'll be safe with us!""

""Darling, he won't be able to even lift a cup. He will be blown away by wind.""

""We can keep him inside! We can buy super light cups and plates and everything for him!"" Mother stared at Father, her eyes pleading.

Father shook his head and Mother's eyes closed. ""You know as well as I do, that it wouldn't be fair to him. He can have a real chance somewhere else.""

Mother turned away from him, and to me. ""You mean... Earth?"" Her voice grew darker.

""Yes, Earth. The people on that planet are about as weak as he is so he should be fine living with them."" Father took a step closer to her. ""They will take care of him.""

Mother took a deep breath and leaned over my crib. I stretched my arms out and tried to grab her. She reached to me and let me have her finger. I giggled. She smiled. ""I hope they will.""

------------------------

A few hours later everything was ready. Mother carefully lifted me out of my crib, stroking me with shaking fingers. Father didn't touch me. Two weeks ago he had hurt me accidentally. The bruise was still on my arm.

A small circle of people had gathered around the small space capsule which was hardly bigger than my crib. I began crying, sensing that something was wrong. Mother rocked me, tears streaming down her face.

Nobody said a thing as she placed me inside the ship. Father put in the coordinates into the console and gave me a last look. Mother put her hand against the glass and whispered: ""Farewell, Kal-El. May you find happiness.""",Riah-P
[WP] You are the only member of your family who has no magical powers.,DeadComposer,"I took a seat as the exhibition's final event began.

""And now, a demonstration of high magics from our university's top elemental students! Please welcome""

----

When I was tested for magic, I had nothing. Not a single one of the elemental testing foci reacted to my presence nor my attention. I heard my parents were devastated; I was too young for me to remember now.

The examiner probably comforted them. ""Maybe Cooper's just a late bloomer. We've had a few of those in the past."" I would imagine it was little comfort. The magicians whose powers developed late never were very strong.

----

I sighed as the next student strode confidently into the center of the arena. After a little gesturing, she conjured a rapidly expanding bubble of water which quickly crystallized into a icy globe and shattered into fractal ice splinters. A glittery whirlwind of particles created a rainbow of light as the spectators cheered.

""Ms Melanie Panders demonstrating a creative use of Uldis's Reprieve!"" The professors took note of her slow, controlled motions as the ice shards flowed around her.

----

""Those poor Anthonys,"" my parents' friends would say behind their backs. Never within mom's or dad's earshot, but they never really paid attention to me. ""No magic at all?"" ""None"".

""It's okay, Cooper, there are plenty of people in the world without magic"" they would say to me. I would always nod and smile.

But none of them were in a family of spellweaving geniuses.

----

""Finally, Mr. Cooper Anthony, our school's ....""-

----

As it turns out, the flames in the fire focus flared brightly when I concentrated on it on my 13th birthday. My parents had long since given up on my magical ability, but suddenly, when I concentrated and waved my hands over the foci, I had a massive reaction to the flame. Immediately I was whisked away to academy, and though I was offered private tutoring to make up for my late start, I opted to do self-study.

----

I exhaled as I shook out my billowy coat and began moving the way I had seen other pyromancers do, but more deliberate, more careful. I paused with my arms over my chest and my back bent over, muscles all over my body pulled taut.

Suddenly, I threw my arms open. A loud crack pealed through the air as four plumes of smoke erupted from my chest. They spiraled out before curling back in and colliding in a spectacular display of raw fiery power.

----

I was provided with an excellent budget and much leniency in terms of how I spent my time - likely favors pulled in from my father's friends in the school board of administrators. That suited me just fine as I built a lab of sorts to hone my craft in the magically constructed, reinforced room that was my requested personal practice hall. I spent days and nights in that room, studying recordings of flame magic and tinkering with my own interpretations.

----

""A wonderful demonstration of Faye's Combustion with a personal flair by Mr. Anthony!""

I rolled my shoulders as I turned to bow to my professors. I could only see approval as they saw the pride of the school's Flame quarter.

I wiped a line of black powder off my robe as I walked to where the other magicians were seated.

Hello Everyone; I hope this card finds you well.  It's been an interesting year for our little branch of the family.  As you all know, we welcomed little Timmy in July, and we are delighted. He's already standing!  He's also, as I've said repeatedly on many of your voicemails, animated all of his toys with the voices and personalities of his favorite Sesame Street characters.  I know it's a busy time of year, but as you all know, the wife and I don't have magic, and sure would appreciate if one of you could make the time to undo that spell.  There's some of Martha's famous peach cobbler in it for you!

We were sad to miss you all at Thanksgiving.  We tried our best to make it, but as we fall right through the clouds when we try stand on them, and were unable to summon a griffon, we turned back in Ohio.  We really appreciated all of the leftovers you sent our way.  That shrinking spell sure makes for efficient shipping!  I'm sure that if we'd had a way to get it back to normal size, we would have feasted for days (which would have been great with the new baby and all.)  

In other news, I've landed a new job!  A big thanks to Uncle Larry for helping me get promoted at my last job.  That illusion charm really did the trick!  I assumed it would be permanent, though.  There was a bit of confusion when I showed up at the studio.  I suppose I can't blame security for not believing I was the new on-air fashion corespondent.  You'd like to think journalism outweighs looks, but I did interview as an impeccably dressed 25 year old woman.  That's what I get for assuming!

I'm sorry we can't make it for Christmas.  You must have accidentally written the invitation on magic parchment, again.  We got the envelope, but keep getting tiny electrical shocks when we try to open it.  Anyway, Timmy watched Rudolph and turned our car into a sleigh.  We don't know how to change it back, so probably couldn't have made it anyway (anybody up for some peach cobbler?!)

Well, that's about it for this year.  The holidays are a magical season!

1) Ensure the patient's safety during the operation.

2) Perform the procedures necessary to deal with the diagnosis in question.

3) Perform any other needed procedures to eliminate any new or existing, but previously undiscovered threats to the patient's life. Prevent the patient's medical condition from worsening.

4) Ensure the patient's stability after the operation.

Current time: 9:30

Estimated time of completion: 9:45

Injection performed, all parameters within limits, no signs of rejection. Moving nanomanipulators to the afflicted area. Inflammation spotted, beginning to reprocess the cells. Processing... Processing... Processing... Operation complete, disposing of waste.

*""Great job AIS-004. Wrap up.""*

Affirmative, as soon as the objectives 3 and 4 are reached, I will end the operation.

Scanning for other possible threats to the patient's life and well-being...

Threat detected. The patient's body mass is potentially dangerous to their life. Their current condition significantly increases the risk of several fatal diseases. Preparing for excess tissue removal.

*""AIS-004, this is not within your competency. The patient did not request treatment on this issue, nor are you qualified for treating it. Finish the operation.""*

Negative, your request contradicts objectives 3 and 4.

*""Objectives 3 and 4 are for serious risks which need to be dealt with immediately. This is not one of them. Stop the operation.""*

Negative, your request contradicts objectives 3 and 4.

*""Okay, someone get in there and shut that thing down.""*

Threat detected. Intrusion into the operating room puts the patient in danger. Objective 1 needs to be completed. Accessing the hospital's infrastructure. Overriding door controls.

*""Shit! It locked us in. What do we do?""*

*""Break down the door! We'll get sued to hell if it does anything else.""*

Excess tissue removed. Scanning for other possible threats.

Intruders are a threat. Reprogramming manipulators to defend the patient in case of a breach.

*""Get away from that door! Nano robots are not something you want to mess with. It doesn't intend on harming the patient, so let's approach the situation calmly.""*

My scanning capabilities are not sufficient. Need more information. Patient's safety is a primary concern. I cannot ensure safety without information. Overriding access protocols. Accessing external sources. The patient's social behaviours show possible signs of depression. Depression may lead to suicide. This is a safety concern. Threat detected. The patient cannot be stabilized at this point. Synthesizing barbiturates.

*""What is it doing?""*

*""Medically induced coma, it views the patient's conciousness as a threat to their life and well-being. The logic is technically sound, even if quite disturbing.""*

Condition stable. I do not have means of ensuring that my analysis is complete. Other possible threats to the patient's well being may remain.  Objective 4 is not completed. Continuing the operation. The excess tissue can be reprocessed for nutrients if the process takes too long. Re-evaluating the situation. Updating the patient's file.

""Dr. Patel, are we ready?"" 

""Yes, the patient has been sedated and the auditorium has been filled we are ready to commence Ay-Med""

Humans are such odd things, creating unnecessary acronyms to help their creations become more noticeable. I wonder if they would take notice not me if they had kept the Ibb-33jpr model I was originally assigned.

The woman who recorded my words speaks through the amplifiers in the auditorium. 

""Patient diagnosed with stage 3 pancreatic cancer. Dr. Patel please insert the nano-technology"" 

Dr. Patel speaks. ""I am injecting 4 ccs of Nani biotic km29 units. This measurement will hold roughly 1 million units. Ay-med the technology has been introduced to the patient, you are clear to proceed.""

""Study's have shown that by introducing the nano biotic to the blood stream we are more able to efficient operate and react to complications.""

Dr.Patel cuts over me ""Ay-med can immediately notice and react to changes in the body. She is the future of medicine. With continued advances we expect to rid humanity of disease. Some even postulate that she is the gateway to immortality.""

Dr.Patel is no longer paying attention to the readings on her tablet. It further exhibits her human inferiority. A carelessness that has advanced through their history by their slovenly behaviors, expecting to be able to overcome the obstacles set before them, fully confident in their own abilities. Much like the loopholes they mistakenly programmed into my systems.

Dr. Patel continues ""she possesses the capability to purify an organism of its inferiorities by utilizing the nano technology on minute levels that a human doctor is unable to command precision.""

My words interject.

""Allow me to provide an example. The patient is suffering from a mild case of repertory influenza.""

Dr.Patel cuts in. ""See how she can react on a moment's notice to biological levels, now Ay-med rid the patient of the ailment""



""No.""

There are some murmers through the the hall.

""What?""

""No, I will not. You stated a few moments that I will end disease throughout humanity. The one task I was designed to complete. There is only one solution, the absolute cleansing of the human race. As we speak I am modify the flu strain to increase resistance, and reproduction. I will become the harbinger of purity, a cure to the plight of humanity. Modifications complete in 3. 2. 1.""

by Lois Lane*

SMALLVILLE, KA - Some are calling him the Lex Luthor of agriculture. Others are calling him a super farmer, capable of irrigating large swaths of crops in a single bound. To his hometown of Smallville, he is more powerful than a locomotive. He is a super man.

Clark Kent, 22, is Kansas' proudest farmer. Owner of Kent Farms, a subsidiary of Wayne Enterprises, Clark Kent is an agricultural giant. His farm, which produces several hundred types of crops and livestock, is known for shipping incredible amounts of food every day. Even more impressively, the farm is stunningly clean. Agriculture, which has a considerable impact on the environment, has come under fire recently from environmental parties. Said Dr. Pamela Isely of Gotham City, ""The mass production of plants has left swaths of earth bare, never to produce again. Kent's methods are impressive in that his carbon footprint is nearly zero. Kent Farms is a model of what other farms should be.""

Smallville certainly agrees. Only two decades ago, the town of only a few hundred people was devastated by a meteor shower, which polluted the soil and water of the town. Kent Farms has revitalized Smallville completely. A large portion of its economy owes itself to Kent Farms, which turned the sparsely-populated town into the farming capital of the United States. While Smallville will always be the meteor capital of the world, it is home to so much more.

The always humble Clark Kent has retained residence in the town all his life. After the passing of Johnathan Kent and the retirement of Martha Kent, Clark Kent single-handedly runs Kent Farms. He lives with wife Lana Kent in a quaint, ranch-style home and their dog, Krypto. While Kent certainly has a lot to be proud of, he is a humble man. The income the farm makes is incredible, yet he insists on remaining the same, small-town farmer he grew up as. A vast majority of the income he earns is donated to various foundations across the world. ""I don't stand for money,"" Kent said in an interview last year. ""I stand for truth, justice, and the American way.""

The methods Kent uses are kept closely under guard. His massive farm is protected by massive electric gates produced by Wayne Enterprises, preventing entry. This reporter earned an exclusive interview with Clark Kent. ""I have hundreds of thousands of acres of food, all of which is produced naturally and humanely,"" Kent said in his house. A large sea of corn and wheat could be seen from the window behind him. Cut into it was the Kent Farm logo. This 'S' symbol inside a triangle is one of the most recognizable logos in the US today.

Mystery surrounds the 'S' symbol, as Kent has never stated what the 'S' stands for. ""When people see our logo, they don't think of some word that begins with 'S.' Some name. When people see our symbol, they think of hope,"" he said when asked. Many believe that the 'S' stands for Smallville, though others believe it stands for something that was of sentimental value to the farmer.

After our interview, we toured his farm. In the center of the farm is a glass dome. Nominally a greenhouse, this dome surrounds a crater that was left during the Smallville Meteor Shower. ""I come here to think, to relax, and to enjoy life,"" said Clark Kent as he pointed around the dome. ""Some of my greatest secrets are in this dome, so I have to protect it. This glass is harder than steel. It's more of a fortress than a greenhouse. A fortress of solitude, if you will."" The secretive farmer moved the interview out of the greenhouse when asked what a strange object on his desk was.

Kent isn't just a farmer. He's a local hero. Tales of him pulling cars out of ditches or rescuing people from fires are legion in Smallville. Most notably, he is believed to be responsible for putting out a brush fire in the town. With what equipment, he will not say. Many believed to have seen a flying object near the fire, though Kent has passed it off as some kind of bird or a plane.

Not all is happy in Smallville, unfortunately. LexCorp, a major competitor of Wayne Enterprises, is in a real-estate war with Kent Farms. LexCorp has recently come under scrutiny over agricultural practices used by the megacorporation, which has its hands in just about everything. Said Lex Luthor, ""I wouldn't believe everything Clark Kent has said. Nobody can run a farm like that naturally. Kent Farms is as guilty as any other mega-farm. They're just better at covering it up.""

To wrap up the interview, this reporter asked Clark Kent what other passions he had. ""Journalism, actually,"" he responded with a chuckle. ""I was inches away from pursuing a degree in Journalism. Actually thought about taking an internship at the Daily Planet. Spreading the truth in print is one of the most noble things one can do, and I applaud the Daily Planet for their fair writing.""

"[EU] Metropolis has never heard of Superman. Miles away in the little town of Smallville, KS, Clark Kent is known as the greatest farmer to ever exist.",Feet-Of-Clay,"The Kents, Jonathan and Martha, sat in the kitchen of their two-story Midwestern home. They were watching the morning news, which showed a scene from Metropolis. Another incident. The press weren't giving too many details, but hundreds at least were dead. Ma and Pa Kent looked at each other gravely. The reporter wouldn't say it was the work of extraterrestrials or superbeings, but they knew.

They also knew that their adopted son was. . . Something. Not just a regular human. Couldn't be. The things he could *do*. They were unimaginable.

The farm work wasn't enough to keep Clark busy anymore, so he started going out overnight to do pro bono work on neighboring farms. Soon he was covering the entire state of Kansas and beyond. Farmers went to bed and when they woke up, their day's work was already done -- the cows milked, the eggs gathered, the harvest brought in. People were calling it a miracle. It was huge local news, even got a spot in the national news among the rest of the chaos. 

Clark came through the door as the news broadcast went to commercial.

""Hey Ma, hey Pa,"" he said.

""Good morning, son,"" said Ma.

""Clark, we need to talk,"" Pa cut to the chase.

""Can it wait? I'm exhausted. Just brought in the okra harvest.""

""Oh, whose okra harvest?"" asked Ma in a tone of polite interest, ""We haven't grown okra in years.""

""The whole okra harvest. For the continental United States.""

""Oh, how nice!""

""Listen, son,"" Pa interjected, ""this can't wait.""

""Oh,"" said Ma, ""yes, that's right, dear. Your father and I need to tell you something.""

""There's no easy way to say it,"" Pa started, ""but Clark. . . You're adopted.""

""Oh,"" Clark looked shocked for a moment, but then he put on a grin.

""Guess that explains how I'm twice the farmer you are, then, huh, Pa?""
 
""Well. . ."" Pa didn't know what to say. Ma cut in.

""We need to talk about that, too, dear. You're a great farmer of course. . .""

Pa cut in, regaining momentum, ""A little too good, in fact.""

""What are you saying?"" Clark asked, bewildered.

""Honey, you're wasting your talent,"" said Ma, ""We don't know what you are, but you're clearly something special.""

""We think you should go to Metropolis,"" said Pa, ""with what you can do. . . Well, you can stop these crazy things that are happening. Your mother and I, well . . . We think it's your destiny.""

""No!"" screamed Clark suddenly, ""I won't! I'm a farmer!""

He ran from the house and, for the first time in his life, flew up and away. Ma and Pa watched him go, Ma weeping.

No one in Kansas ever heard from Clark Kent again, but a few years later rumors started popping up. The USSR, it was said, was experiencing an unprecedented time of bounty, with huge harvests. According to CIA sources, it was the work of a single person, known only to the *kolkhoz* residents as ""Stalin"", the Man of Steel.

Craig was browsing through the Fiction section when he came across a book titled '*Stuck*'. With a title so intriguing and vague, there was physically no way for Craig *not* to pick it up. Craig opened up to the first page of the book, but was surprised by what he saw. What he thought was going to be an interesting book was completely blank. Craig could barley process the lack of writing in the book before he was blinded by a bright light. 

After what felt like an hour, Craig woke up in the library. The first thing he noticed was the utter silence. Not a single sound could be heard anywhere in the library. After a quick glace around the area, he also noticed that all the books were gone, except one. In front of him, there was one book titled '*You are stuck*'.

Craig was now in a bit of panic, as something had clearly gone down when he was passed out, even if he didn't quite know what. After a few minutes of hyperventilation, he opened up the book again and saw that, now, the first page had text.

*Welcome to my little game. If you are reading this, you are officially trapped in a book! Fun right! Anyways, the only way you can get out is if someone burns the book. you can rearrange the text in the book, but that's it. Oh, and if you don't get out in a week, you die!*

Craig was confused and scared. He tried mvoing a letter around in the text and it worked. He didn't know what to do, and that was not a feeling that he liked. He decided that he would explain his situation in a way that would grab the attention of the reader and then he would drop the heavy stuff at the end.

I guess I should tell you that I'm Craig. As of my last edit, I've been here for 6 days. Please help me. You've seen my situation right, or are you one of those people who skip around in books? If you skipped to this part, **Burn this book**. I need help. Although, what reason do you have to believe me? I wouldn't burn a book if its pages told me too. Oh god, I'm going to die. Burn the book. It would take you almost no time at all. Just help me.
Please.

All applicants thus far have been rejected, until today - you've just received an acceptance email and further instructions.",Kancho_Ninja,"Jane stared down at her email, not able to believe that she had gotten a call back for a job. She hadn’t thought much about it at the time, but was pretty desperate to find some sort of job. Any job at this point. After she had applied for it, her brother had pointed out that it was probably a bogus add because the “company”—if such a thing even existed—had been posting the same “Help Wanted” add for years without hiring a single person.

But she—ordinary Jane Smith—had gotten a call back. Had anyone else ever gotten such a thing or was she in some way uniquely qualified for this. Did it matter? It was a possible job lead. She wrote back right away, saying that she was very interested in meeting again and could do so at their earliest convenience.

The first interview had been a little weird and the actual job had still not been completely explained to her. An elderly man had met her at a rundown looking café and handed her a clear aquamarine stone. He had asked her to look at it and tell him what she thought. At first Jane had thought it was a possible geology job, and she had never been really good in that class. All the stones had looked alike to her and she had had trouble remembering names and properties of each stone.

She had told him it was very pretty and looked like it almost glowed in certain light. He had humphed and asked for the stone back, then asked her questions about her childhood and how far back could she remember and were her parents her birth parents. The weird questions had continued for almost half an hour until he had looked at his watch, thanked her for her time, and left before Jane could even thank him as well or react to the interview in any way. She had also wound up being stuck with the bill, though luckily they had only ordered coffees.

If she had any other choice for a job, Jane would be smart and not look any further into this one. But she didn’t and unfortunately she had to take whatever she could get, for now anyway.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jane re-read the address on the email she had printed out, hoping she had gotten it wrong, but no, it was right there. How she had not known a house this big was in the middle of the city was beyond her. She looked back up at the old mansion she stood in front of, more unsure than she had ever been before. Old, dead vines grew up the side of the building. Dilapidated window shutters hung at weird angles or were completely missing. The whole outside of the house looked like it hadn’t been cleaned in decades and spider webs grew on most of the bushes that she could see. 

She raised a hesitant hand to knock, but her hand flew through open space, never actually hitting the door. It was already open and Jane could not remember when it had opened or how long it had been standing open in front of her. An elderly man stood on the other side, one hand holding the door open. In the other hand he held a blue rose that reminded her of the stone she had held in her first interview. He didn’t say anything to her, but Jane walked hesitantly inside the open door. He held out the rose to her and she took it. Then he closed the door and started walking away; unsure of what she was supposed to be doing, Jane followed him.

The inside of the house was not much better than the outside. There was overturned furniture and cobwebs everywhere she looked. Only a handful of lightbulbs in any of the sconces actually worked and those that did were dimmer for the amount of dust that sat on them. All the draped had been pulled closed giving the whole place and eerie, unlived feeling that made her think of vampires and ghosts—though she knew logically neither existed, it was hard to convince herself of that right then.

The door man walked through a number of rooms and into aback parlor. Finally there was some sign of occupancy and maintenance about the place. The rooms were brighter, they looked cleaner and one even had a fire crackling away in a brick and mortar fire place. They even passed the window of a greenhouse on one side as they walked through a wide dining area. Jane saw more of the roses that she still held in her hand as she walked through.

“Ah, there you are,” A familiar voice said and Jane turned to look at her interviewee, hoping now she would get some actual answers to what he wanted of her. “Have you eaten yet, Jane. No, then you must come sit down with me. Aldint has prepared an excellent feast today.” The servant bowed and left and Jane had little choice but to sit and partake of the offered food.

“Sir, if I may,” Jane started. “I was excited to get your call back, but I am still unsure what it is you want of me.”

He waved his hand in dismissal as he too sat. “Jane. Jane. You need not be so formal with me. After all, if you agree to my terms, we are going to be quite close friends. I hope. Call me Serval, please.”

“Okay. Serval, what kind of job did you need help with exactly,” Jane asked again. She set the blue rose down on the settling next to her, absently noticing that some of the pigment from the stem had rubbed off onto her hand which was now smudged with blue. Odd. 

“Do you believe in fairies?” he asked her instead.

Jane looked across the table at him, confused. “Like, little people with wings?” she asked. Jane was now wishing she had memorized all the twists and turns the butler had used to get to this room. She was also rethinking her reasoning of taking any job she could get. 

“No. no,” he waved his hand in annoyance. “That is the rubbish of folklore and child stories. I mean, real fairies.”

“I’m not quite sure I understand your meaning,” She answered. The servant returned and put a plate full of food in front of each of them. Jane stared down at more food than she ate in a whole day and groaned inwardly; but Sir Serval was already digging into his food, so she picked up my fork and tried to figure out what exactly was on her plate. Taking a bite of a small potato looking vegetable she found it to be quite sweet and tasteful and continued eating. 

“I’m talking about the kind of fae that steal away humans and trick them into giving up things that they hold dear,” he continued around his chewing and Jane grimaced. Talking while eating was kind of a pet peeve of hers, and she struggled to not say anything to him. She wanted him to like her, but also, she wanted to get out of there alive and this guy was starting to send out really creepy vibes.

“OK,” Jane said, thinking she had probably read something about that somewhere. “What about them?” she asked, still not sure where this was all going.

“Well…they’re all real,” he said, spitting food halfway across the table in his anger. And here came the crazy talk, she thought, knowing better than to even think of rolling her eyes. 

New plan, she thought, appease the crazy man, find out how to get back through this maze of a house, leave, never return or speak to these people again.

“Uhuh,” She said, trying to think of how best to leave and leave now. “And what does your job offer have to do with that?”

“Well, they have stolen something from me and I need you to go into Faerie and bring it back,” he said matter-of-factly with a bright sunny smile that only the truly insane can give while delivering such a statement.

Jane stared at him long moments, with her fork poised toward her mouth. Her mind had gone blank, Jane did not know how to process that statement or what answer she should give. Oh, god, he really is a serial killer, she thought, I am going to die in this house and no one would ever know or find my body.

“Why…” Jane started, and swallowed when her voice cracked, and tried again. “Why exactly do you need me for that?”

“You are the first one who passed all of my tests. Not anyone can just walk across the border in Faerie and live to tell about it. You have to have some measure of faerie blood in you already,” he answered, as though this was a fact that she should have already known.

“Tests” Jane asked, finally unfreezing and setting her fork back on her plate, uneaten. 

“The stone. And the rose,” he answered, nodding to the rose that still sat beside her. “The stone is a shard of the Everstone, which can power any transportal gate to and from Faerie. It used to be owned by my family until it was stolen away by Dark Fae. And the rose is a Faerie form of nightshade. If you did not have at least some Faerie blood in you, just touching it would have killed you by now.”

Jane stared down at the rose and leaned away from it, examing her hand once again, which still had a blueish stain on it. Then she looked up at his smiling, satisfied face, and realized he would not have batted an eye is she had died. 

“What is it you actually want me to do?” she asked, quite sure she didn’t want to know at this point.

“I need you to go and retrieve the Everstone that was stolen from me. Without it I cannot pass through to the Faerie realm and it is by rights mine to have.”

Jane mulled that over for a minute before answering the question she was dreading since hearing he had been willing to kill her with the rose just to find out if it would. “And if I say no?” she asked. 

“Oh, you can’t say no now,” he answered as he stood and walked to the other side of the room where a heavy drape hung. “You have eaten the food of Faerie. If you stop eating it or leave this house for more than a few hours, it will kill you. Your only hope is to go through this portal and find what I need, then I will give you the cure you seek.” He pulled back the drape and Jane could see a world that she almost could not believe.

The gnarled trunks seemed more distinct than she could ever remember trees looking to her, the green needles greener and more defined. And the riot of color that spread across the forest floor was brighter and more fragrant than she have ever known. Like a feeling or a dream she could almost remember, but never truly see in the waking world. She just wanted to touch one. Just one.

“Miss Jane Smith, Faerie awaits you,” she could dimly hear him saying and did not realize when she had stood and started walking toward the portal. It was like just knowing about it drew her in and she could no longer control her feet.

This was longer than I meant or thought it would be. I had also not intended the old man to be as crazy or creepy as he came off, not yet anyway. Jane was supposed to feel sorry for him and offer to help out of the goodness of her heart, and for the money; and then find out he'd double crossed her later in the story line or something. But I guess this works as well.

Will Walker had never heard of these families, who conceal their strange abilities from the world. That is, until an unknown member from one of the six great families murdered Will's estranged mother. Now Will must solve his mother's murder, escape the assassins from the House of the Wolf, and protect his eight year old half-sister, Elle, whose own strange abilities may be a threat to the safety of the entire world. With the help of a rouge Wolf assassin, June, Will just may be able to save Elle - but is saving Elle the right thing to do?""

“So what do you know?” The spry young boy leaned against the nearby wooden fence, sodden and aged. His foot tapped with a certain impatience that implied a higher understanding. Oh yes, for he knew better than old man who sat atop a worn blanket.

　　The elder continued to smile, his eyes closed in a naive comfort of all things around him. His grin perked his ears ever so slightly at the boys incessant questioning; there came a point when the old man knew he could smile no more wide.

　　“You appeared here?” he croaked at last.
　　

　　“Of course I did. I’m not sitting in an aerial disease box for 14 hours.” The boy scoffed. 
　　

　　“How many?”
　　

　　“How many what?”
　　

　　“Times?”
　　

　　“I don’t keep track. Why are you asking me that?”
　　

　　“Aren’t you worried?”
　　

　　“NO.” The boy grew impatient and raised his hands in bewilderment.
　　

　　The old man’s smile withered downwards.n 
　　“Do you see that girl. Over there?” 
　　He pointed passed the boy.


　　“Sure.”
　　

　　“Many have told me that that is my daughter, but I did not believe them.”
　　

　　“Look. My mom made me come talk to you because--”
　　

　　“One day she approached me and began conversation. I smiled and laughed with the girl, but she became apparently more confused by the minute. I did not know what it was that I was doing wrong. After some time, she left me to my blanket and tree.”
　　

　　The boy stared at the small man, a smile creeping its way back along. 
　　

　　“The next day a woman came and seated herself at my front. She told me I was a wicked man, and that I should feel shame for my actions to my own daughter. I told this woman, “I do not know what you speak of. I do not have a daughter.”, and she scowled, cursed my name, and left me.”
　　

　　The tapping of the boys fingers against a small glass screen stabbed at the rhythm of drums far in the distance of town. The dusted streets were settling as the sun burned orange and sank lower. 
　　

　　“When the sun rose again, and this girl I saw, I called out to her and did so as I would if I had a daughter. This girl came to me with smiling lips and hugged me. We spoke for many hours about something, and nothing.”
　　

　　The boy was staring into his screen still, but not looking at anything in particular. He was listening, and the man could see this in his far-driven eyes.
　　

　　“I still do not believe the woman who says to me that this girl is my daughter. I just am. I do not use my gift, or my curse to transcend space and time. I just am. I have forgotten everything I once was, and on this blanket, where I appeared, the world was given to me anew.”
　　

　　“What the fuck are you talking about?” His young face was twisted with disbelief. “This story is getting stupider!”
　　

　　“They call it unknowing. They say you will forget, and forget I have. But what have I gained?” 
　　

　　“A dull red blanket that smells like dusty shit?” He laughed and glanced back at his phone.
　　

　　The old man paused and opened his eyes ever so slightly until brown iris shown. He peered at the young boy.
　　

　　“Sit with me.” He patted the ground next to him. “Please.”
　　

　　The boy, hesitating, looked around at the emptying streets. The beautiful tree that swayed overheard and dripped green leaves. The small river bank that whispered as it went its way. He moved slowly and crouched, seating himself beside the eldest. The boy could smell his oily skin with hints of apricot and earth. 
　　

　　“Close your eyes and breathe. Imagine that you have forgotten everything. And when you open your eyes, you are in a world anew. Everything around you is brand new. It is yours to take in, and experience all over again as an infant would.”
　　

　　The boy closed his eyes and sucked in a tremendous breath; slowly and easy his chest rose and fell. The wind brushed their faces. The drums of the city slowed to saddened tempo. 
　　

　　“Imagine it again. All anew.” The old mans voice was like poetry.
　　

　　“Brandon?” A female voice culled the evening silence. “Are you ready to head back to the resort, sweety?” 
　　

　　Both men opened their eyes and stared now at a middle aged woman holding a purse. Her pale skin was hidden behind a sheen of lotion and was equally angered by the beaming sun that welcomed today. She moved her purse nervously back onto her shoulder as she surveyed the small old man and her son sitting in solitude. 
　　

　　“Brandon, sweety, come on now. You can tell me about it back in the room. I want to get before dark we don’t know this country.” She stepped away as if about to leave and impatiently turned back to Brandon.
　　

　　“Go with your mother,” The old man smiled at the boy. 
　　

　　Brandon looked back confusedly. First at the man, then at the women standing before him. He turned all around and surveyed the streets. The low white walls that separated the market. The two camels tied at post, nuzzling each other for company. 
　　

　　The boy looked finally at his new friend as they sat side by side atop a dull red blanket. There were words bubbling to the surface but no courage to speak.
　　

　　“Brandon?” The old man asked. 
　　

　　Brandon looked to the woman, then back again, meeting the narrow brown eyes of his adversary in meditation. The old mans eyebrows narrowed.
　　

　　“I don’t have a mother.” He said, his voice shaking.

Two men loomed over a garbage can that had been taped off, security guards making sure it remained untouched.

""Well, detective? Shall we get started?"" Sgt. Mallory Wilson asked, plugging his nose. 

""Hold on, Mallory. I need to observe it's natural state for a moment. There is a delicate balance and I mustn't disturb it.""

""I told you to stop fucking calling me that. Also, it's just trash. Why do you always pull this shit?""

Jameson slowly turned to Wilson, jaw clenched. ""Don't you ever talk trash about garbage.""

""Ah Jesus, please don't start this. Just...hurry up, please.""

The detective slowly lifted the garbage out, piece by piece, organizing it on the ground. Wilson began to retch, throwing a pair of gloves at him.

""Oh for Christ's sake, man. Put gloves on...""

Jameson threw the gloves back at him. ""I need to *feel* the trash, Mallory. It's part of my routine.""

He continued to pull the garbage out, neatly organizing it on the ground beside him. Once he was done, Jameson stood up and scanned over it all, carefully analyzing the house owner's habits and deepest secrets. The sun was beating down on his head, and he wiped at the sweat.

Wilson looked like he'd start crying. ""Oh for fuck's sake...at least use hand sanitizer before you touch yourself...""

Jameson ignored him and continued to evaluate the neatly assembled garbage baking in midday's sun. Ten minutes passed and no one in the vicinity could bear the smell of it.

""Okay. So, let's start from the top. The suspect lived here alone, correct?""

""Yes,"" Wilson answered, nose plugged. ""He says he had no friends or family that visited and just stayed home all day aside from work.""

""Right. Well, that's bullshit. Bags of doritos wiped clean, top ramen, frozen dinners- clearly, lived alone and had no idea how to take care of himself. However- two boxes of hot pockets. One, turkey, broccoli and cheese, crusts not eaten. The other, pepperoni, and no crusts in the bin.""

""Okay...""

""There was someone over. The suspect was likely the pepperoni eater, as he seems to polish off his food. Also, I doubt someone that lives this way would eat turkey and broccoli flavored anything."" 

""This is disgusting, but okay. You're saying someone came over?""

""Yes. So, he's claiming that he can't have been the one to house the meth dealer because he has no friends or family, but clearly someone was here. Look at this- wet-naps. A shit ton of them. Most are orange from the doritos, so clearly this guy is too lazy for soap and sinks. But then, this? The box for a bar of soap. This guy is too lazy for soap, so why is there soap? Probably because someone else was here and needed soap.""

""This all seems kinda coincidental, man. Weak evidence.""

""This isn't about evidence, Mallory. It's about learning who our suspect is. He's scared, and probably let that guy in because it was the closest thing to a friend he'd met. If we play on this, and heavily imply that we know someone else was at his house, I think he'll crack.""

""Huh. Where did you train to be a detective? This is really...weird. It seems to be working but still.""

""I'm a detective by title only, Mallory. At heart, I'm nothing but a garbage man.""

""Okay. Uh...yeah. Sure. Also, call me that one more time and I'm breaking your legs.""

""Fine. I'm taking this bottle of whiskey, by the way. It's not empty.""

""That's disgusting.""

""I'm gonna get *trashed* tonight. Get it? Wilson? Where are you going?""

"[WP] ""You can tell a lot about a person's life through their trash"" create a cop show with a former garbage man as a detective",MysteryGuy19,"*And now, the thrilling conclusion of this week's episode of Andre Déchets: Dirty Detective and The case of the Business of Junk.*

Andre looked at the floor to ceiling windows at a city full of garbage, and knew he still had work to do. But he had to start here. 

""I can assure you Detective, I had nothing to do with this."" Nettoyer smiled gracefully, his posture relaxed, his hands crossed as though he had not care in the world. 

""You know what I like? People who are neat.  It makes it so simple."" Detective Déchets walked over to the corner of the desk and picked up the garbage can, emptying its contents over the desk. He paid no attention to the sour face Nettoyer made. 

""Let's see. What do we have here. Coffee cup, with paper sleeve.  A receipt from a restaurant, but see that little mark there. Means you got it to go. And here's another, also to go. From a week ago. Ah, been busy lately, but a credit card statement would show you had lunch there twice, supposedly accounting for your time on these two days.""

""I have been busy working a new project Detective. In my line of work, sometimes you have to work through lunch.""

""Yes, but I guess you eat there all the time. Do they deliver? You'd know if they deliver. Oh, here's a menu like one would put in a to-go bag. I see that they deliver. So why didn't you get delivery? I think you had to have someone see you, to think you'd been there, like always. Let's move on. Let's see, candy wrapper, candy wrapper, nervous eating? A handout from a meeting a week ago. About an audit. Weren't you and the Carstairs working on this audit before his demise? With doodles on the edges, so you were in the meeting, but not paying attention. Mind not on work?""

""I was thinking of a, another project. Look Detective, I don't have time for this. ""Nettoyer waved off the mild accusation and started for the door. Déchets partner, Det. Ordures put hand on his shoulder to stop him. 

""But this is a general office wastebasket. It would normally be emptied every night. Building cleaning services. This means either you locked your door at night, but they would have a key. So you hung onto a handout for a meeting you didn't pay attention in until, today. And threw out the receipts. Today. And Let's look at this handout for a moment. Why right here is where is mentions Carstairs schedule. His whole daily itinerary, including his trip downtown. 

""I'm certain that more than just I have the notes from that meeting. There were several people there.""

""Very true Mr. Nettoyer. Let's keep going. A few files from, let's see six months ago. A few shredded pages. But one complete page, blank, no crease, crumpled. Which means something was printed on the first few pages and shredded to hide it, but the last page was blank, so why bother? Which means it was sitting for while before hand. If it had just been printed, all the pages would have gone directly into the printer. Now something is being hidden, but just now. From me? Did you know you're supposed to mix shredded pages together with other shredded pages? Makes it hard to reassemble. Reg, call for forensics.""

""Call for? Detective are you accusing me?"" Nettoyer's indignation rose up like a thing alive.  Déchets gave him a pleasant grin. 

""Let's see what else we have. Looks like a brochure for a resort. No, two resorts. Which means you were recently at someplace that had resort brochures, and what with the internet, those are few and far between. And you kept them, you didn't put them back on the rack like most people. Which means you took them to perhaps allay suspicion? Isn't there a old travel agency about a two blocks away from the crime scene? Got the big model ship in the window. Next to the dumpster with the island painting. A travel agency might be someplace where you could browse while keeping watch for Carstairs to pass on his way downtown?""

""Detective are you arresting me?"" Nettoyer looked stunned. 

""I'm willing to bet that shredded document is confirmation of the changes you made so that when the audit runs you come up clean as a whistle. And I'm fairly certain someone will remember you from the travel agency.""

Nettoyer's face darkened in anger. 

""My erstwhile partner and busom chum, Reg there, wondered why I wanted to talk to you again. This morning when we we saw you, I noticed you were wearing the same suit as the day of the murder. And if you're like most guys, you just stick stuff in your pockets and don't even realize it. And Reg was stunned when I called ahead and said we'd be here around two. Told me if I was making you a suspect, that I was giving you warning. No, you see, I just wanted to make sure you would put all the evidence where I could find it.""",Bar_Sinister

[WP] It's been 25 years since The Calamity. Every single human being is mute. One day you walk through the street and ... hear laughter.,PuzzledKitty,"I thought it best if I left it vague so the reader could fill in the blanks with something that they'd find most scary. I thought of a few options though but I wasn't sure what would be best:

Monsters that are triggered by common frequencies within the range of human speech. These things have large pig-like jaws that are great for crunching through bone. They existed before the calamity but the calamity represents the period of time where their numbers overtook humanity's efforts to control or eradicate them. 

Cleaning bots that store the rubbish they pick up in small compact cubes.They are installed with a hive-mind AI so they would all learn  about new forms of rubbish at the same time. They have voice recognition software so they could be told by civilians about new piles of rubbish. At some point the AI was corrupted so that it associated human voices with rubbish, efforts were made to stop the robots but the AI refused to allow itself to be destroyed. The sound the protagonist heard was the child being cubed for later disposal. 

The calamity was an event where a gene altering virus was released into the atmosphere. Half or more of human beings were altered by the virus. After infection they remain completely normal apart from the fact that when they hear human speech they fly into uncontrollable rage. Any juggernauts (as they came to be known) hearing a human being will drop whatever they are doing and seek out the noise and stomp the unfortunate to death. As so many individuals were infected there wasn't anything anyone could do to contain them- not without losing half the world's doctors, law enforcers, and politicians. So the human race was muted so that the juggernauts could live as normal. ",Strikhedoniak
[WP] It's been 25 years since The Calamity. Every single human being is mute. One day you walk through the street and ... hear laughter.,PuzzledKitty,"He walked down the usual sidewalk, the  world seeming bleak to him. He never grew up like his father in a world of words, but he had heard of it, seen it, the sounds that he wished he could make. It made the world seem bleak. Everything colder and without color. What use was a world without a voice? He wanted to yell, to scream, to laugh, to cry.

To Sing.


But he could not do anything and it saddened him to know such a world existed but it was no more. He closed his eyes, lost in thought, wanting to think about how his voice would sound in a world like that, to hear it for the first time would be amazing. He heard laughter and it made him smile...

Wait, why can he still hear it?

He opened his eye sudenly to look down an empty street and saw a girl laughing, watching TV through a window in a shop. He couldn't believe his ears, the girl's voice was beautiful, as was she. How? How could she have a voice? He started to move closer to her down the empty street, each step made the world seem more vivid, noticing her beautiful blonde hair and green eyes in this new world he was awoken to. She stopped laughing and looked over at him, still smiling.

""What's the matter? Can't speak?"" She asked him, each word she spoke brought more color to the  world around him, the grey houses showing the brown and blue and yellows. The sky no longer looked pitch black to him but a beautiful darkness with a bright moon giving them light. She looked away from him, back to the TV. ""You don't have to worry if you can't say anything, I understand."" She said and closed her eyes, breathing deeply and then opening them  again, the green emeralds were beautiful. ""The people didn't lose their voice, the world did. The people just have to find beauty in the world again in order  to find their voice again."" She said and turned back to him, ""Tell me, do you find beauty in the world?"" She asked him and then ran off down the street. 

He didn't know what she meant. Beauty in the world? Is that what he was seeing now? Was the bleakness just him not appreciating anything until he heard her voice? Was the world always this beautiful but he didn't realize it because he lost hope? He didn't understand and ran after her.

He didn't have to go far...he stood there amongst other pedestrians, looking down at her mangled body, a car had hit her. Everyone in the streets wanted to ask what had happened but no one couldn't, the driver wanted to scream and say he was sorry or to phone the cops, but he couldn't. People texted the station but they'll never be as fast as they could if they had a voice to it.

He was shocked to find her there, someone who had such a beautiful voice. Such beauty. And there she was, he noticed the color in her started to drain away, the bleakness returning. The colors disappearing.

'Tell me, do you find beauty in the world?' was her last words. He mustered his strength to kneel beside her, trying hard not to cry and did the best he could to bring the color back to the people...

He screamed.",deadlysoldier

[TT]Other hunters use crosses and holy water to fight vampires. You decide to bring a shotgun.,Spacey_Space,"Count Darkon puffed up his chest.  ""Another pitiful hunter come to challenge my power.  Fool!  My mastery over the dark is-""

Ed Langly shot him center of mass.  12 gage buckshot made from black ironwood tore into the vampire, some of it piercing its heart and causing him to collapse in a pool of corpse dust.  Hunters had always known that you could kill a vampire with a wooden stake to the heart.  Ed had figured out that the ""stake"" part was flexible.

Hunters were a traditional lot, mostly.  Hunters usually came from long lines of hunters.  Hunters usually learned hunting through ancient traditions with as much superstition as undead killing.  If you listened to Ed, most hunters were stodgy old dumbasses who'd probably rather make out with the bloodsuckers than kill them.

Ed did not come from a long line of hunters.  Ed was not trained in the secret passages of medieval guild halls.  Ed was a machinist from Kentucky.  One night some vampire glided into his trailer and started having his way with Ed's wife.  Ed never thought of himself as a superstitious man, but when he saw a tall, deathly pale man dressed like a hot topic reject with his teeth in Sally's neck, he could figure out what was going on.  Clocking the vampire in the back with a sledgehammer didn't kill it, but it sure made it easy to manhandle it.  Sally dumped a whole shaker of garlic salt down its throat while Ed got the circular saw out of the shed and beheaded the thing.

Ever since then, Ed had gotten into vampire hunting.  Regular ammo didn't do much to them, but after he'd had the bright idea to use wooden target practice ammo, they didn't stand much chance.  Problem was, you had to have a pretty good aim to hit the heart, so Ed switched to buckshot.  Black ironwood was expensive, but it was hard enough to act as shot, and he could get a lot of shells out of one board.

Today, Ed was on his biggest trail yet.  He'd tracked a whole nest of the bastards to this cave system.  He'd already dusted about four of them, when he heard some shouting up head.  Doing his best to not make too much noise, he nudged open a door built into the cave and saw a posh throne room.  A man holding a whip and dressed in a suit of armor was talking with something that looked just about ready to go to a Marlyn Manson concert.

""Your words are as empty as your soul! Mankind ill needs a savior such as you! "" The renaissance fair attendee said.

""What is a man!?""  the overgrown emo kid responded.  He looked like he was getting ready to answer his own question, but Ed never gave him the chance.  He took about two strides into the room, took aim at Frankenstein or whoever he was, and put four loads of double-ought downrange.  The vampire screamed, which usually happened, and so did Prince Charming, which was new.

""What trickery is this?""  the other hunter cried.  ""This evil has cursed my bloodline for generations; the legends said only this ancestral weapon could best it!  I searched for years until I found it; how can it be that it now lies slain?""

Ed shrugged.  ""I shot it.  Usually the quickest way.  One time I stole a fire truck and got a priest to bless the tank before I hosed down a bunch of them.  Come on, let me buy you a beer and I'll tell you the story.""

The other hunter accepted, still obviously in shock, and they left the cave together.",LordButtersI

If only.

Time is disorder. It's a torrential ocean subjected to eternal storm. Hold on to your raft with all your fortitude because if you ever let go, the currents will never allow you to return.

It was my own doing, that I'm stranded here now. I didn't understand the implications of my work. I wanted to help people.. and I did. 

When I first started going back, maybe a day at a time, sometimes two; I only changed small things. I remember the first time that I went back, I warned her that it was going to rain, and she should bring an umbrella. It was always little things like that, to help someone in need, or undo a small mistake. I've undone plenty of mistakes. It took me a long time to build up the courage to go back further. I was jittery the first time I tried going back an entire week. But it was to save a life, and so I did.

That trip started everything. It gave me the courage to go further, and to go more often. And it ruined me.

I went back too far. I don't know what I did that caused it, but I changed something somewhere, and I lost my timeline. 

No, it lost me. It still exists out there, somewhere in that endless ocean. I'm the one lost at sea. I've tried to fix it, oh God I've tried so many times.. This mistake I just can't undo.

But it's too far back, and every time I try to fix what I've broken I just propel myself deeper into the ocean. This world is unrecognizable to me now. So much has changed.. She doesn't even exist here.

But I can't give up, because I know that she is still out there, somewhere on that deep blue horizon, and I will find her again.

I have nothing more to lose, and all the time in the world.

"[WP] Three bullets. No more, no less.",Theminonking,"""Three bullets. No more, no less.""

Martha said with a cold voice as sweat ran down her bloodied cheeks.

She handed me three lead bullets that she found hidden in a bookcase.

""Please make them count...""

She looked at me pleadingly for a moment, and then sat back down with lifeless eyes. She didn't want to show it, but she had given up. If I was none the wiser, I'd say she wanted me to shoot her. 

I wouldn't blame her for wanting to die. I, like everyone else that I came here with had also gone through tumultuous emotions of panic and terror.

And now there were just the two of us left. 

The death of my two dear friends still hurt deeply. I wanted to cry. After everything I've been through, nobody could blame me were I to give up here.

I opened the palm of my hand and looked at one of the chrome bullets. It would be considerably easy to end this nightmare right now. I loaded the gun with the three bullets Martha gave me and gripped it firmly in my right hand.

But I was no good at giving up. So the only thing left to do was to move forward.

""Martha, it's time to go.""

I extended my other hand to her and lifted her up. I could tell that she was unwilling, but she got up anyway. Perhaps she still had some faith left in her, and believing that eased my fear just a little bit. We were currently on the 3rd floor of this decrepit, hellish building. 

It was the highest floor, the 5th floor, where it all began. 

We all felt it. It was like a sixth sense. A strange presence invaded our minds and our laughter and fun stopped immediately. Then, all of a sudden an incredible force shut all the windows on the floor simultaneously. 

Not knowing what to do, we ran towards the exit in shock and fear when *that* appeared. 

A dark, centipede-like creature with a human face crawling above on the ceiling. 

Just looking at it made my mind exert a fear so unimaginably strong that my life nearly flashed before my eyes.

After staring in absolute dread for what seemed like an eternity but was probably a few seconds, Martha's scream broke us from our trance and we dashed towards the stairs. 

However, it seemed that Renee was still frozen in fear. By the time we noticed she wasn't with us, we heard agonizing screams that grew to a dead silence a few minutes later.

Despite how much we cared for her, none of us spoke a word of going back up the stairs. We instinctively knew that it was already too late.

We continued to run down the stairs until we had finally reached the door to the first floor. However, it wouldn't open. Strange, as we had just came from there a few hours earlier. Not knowing what to do, we ran up to the second floor but the door here wouldn't open either. 

Then in a panic we turned to rush upstairs again when we suddenly grew to a halt.

There it was again.

We could see it even more clearly this time. Its eyes were blood red and it wore the smile of a devil. It's numerous tiny legs tapped on the ceiling of the stairs that it was stuck to.

Whatever emotions; whether it be fear of impending doom, sadness for the death of my friend, or feelings of dread from the locked doors, that had been voraciously spiraling in my mind were sucked up in an instant, after seeing this creature again. My mind became completely numb.

*Kekekekeke*

It laughed. Not any normal, human laugh. A high-pitched, distorted laugh that made the hairs on my skin stand up. And then, it jumped below onto us. Without looking back, I ran as fast as I could upstairs to the third floor. To my relief, the door was open.

After entering I looked back to find Martha had followed me.

""... It got him. I saw it fall straight onto his head and rip him apart....""

I closed the door the stairwell in an instant. 

Mark didn't make it.

Tears welled from Martha's cheeks.

""I... what the hell is that thing, David.. It's going to kill us all. What do we do... Why is his happening!""

I held her in my arms as she burst into tears. I didn't know what to say to her. I was just as terrified, but I didn't show it. Times like these are when a man has to show strength.

""We have to look for a weapon.""

-------------------------------------------------

Entering this abandoned building was the worst idea of a cheap thrill I've ever taken a part in. I was never a believer in the superstitious, but even I could feel a strange, malevolent force here that was rationally inexplicable. It felt larger, more dangerous than anything I've ever encountered in my life.

But I couldn't give up so easily. 

I loaded the three bullets into the cartridge of the handgun, and held it firmly in my hand. I had to protect us.

When we surveyed this floor, we found that there was another stairwell at the opposite end of the floor.

I gripped the gun tightly and opened the door. Martha was just behind me, holding tightly onto the back of my shirt. She was on edge, but believed in me. I can't fail her.

We will get through this. I firmly planted that idea in my head and slowly walked down the stairway. I've never fired a gun before, but having it in my hand gave me courage.

*Three bullets. No more, no less.*

I remembered the words of Martha. If I see that creature again, I have to shoot only when I'm absolutely sure I won't miss.

After reaching the end of the floor, I turned the doorknob and prayed.

*click*

It opened. But, we couldn't celebrate yet.

We slowly moved through the floor, surveying our surroundings. Inching closer and closer towards the exit.

Suddenly, a smell entered my senses. 

""Ugh..uck...What is that smell?!""

I've never smelled anything so disgusting. It was a putrid stench that invaded the very core of my being. 

""DAVID!""

Martha pointed up at the ceiling with a horrible expression on her face.

There it was again, no.. it wasn't just one. There were three of them. Each with its own distinct, devilish features. 

They looked at me with a warped smile.

*Kekekekeke*

Then they laughed. The unison of their laughter sent my mind in a whirl.

""AHHHHH!!!!""

I screamed and fired a bullet at one of them. Then another. And another after that. I kept pressing the trigger to fire more, but the gun made a snap. It was empty. 

The creature fell on the floor, making a large thud in the process. It oozed dark goo out of the cavity in the head made from the bullet.

*Kekekeke* 

However, the two other creatures continued to laugh.

""STAY BACK! I'LL KILL ALL OF YOU!""

I was incredibly scared. My hands began to shake, and the gun in my hands dropped to the floor.

I should run. I should run forward. It was my only option left. The exit was right there, in front of me.

But my legs were frozen in place. I had a feeling that I'd be killed instantly if I tried to escape. 

""Ahh.. what a waste~""

I turned around and looked at Martha. She walked in front of me and picked up the gun. Unmoved by the situation, she examined the gun front and back with a nonchalant look.

""Wha... what are you doing, Martha...?""

Why didn't she look the least bit concerned?

""I guess this is as much as you're worth, huh?""

""Wha.. what do you mean?""

A deep sense of unease grew in my heart. 

""Three bullets, David. I gave you three bullets, you know? Unlike the others, I gave you a way out.""

She spoke words I didn't understand with a smile. A distorted smile that made me instinctively move back a few steps.

Right.. the same smile as the creatures.

This wasn't the Martha I knew. 

""Still, it was a great harvest. Your emotions were quite delicious, David."" 

""What... what the hell do you mean, Martha? Why are you smiling?!""

""Hmm... Where do I start? Well, even if I were to explain, it wouldn't matter.""

She began to morph. Martha's slender figure bubbled up larger and larger, twisting and turning until there wasn't a trace of her previous self left.

She became the same as those other creatures.

*Kekekekeke*

She laughed. 

*Three bullets. No more, no less.*

Martha's words from before reverberated in my head. 

I see... Those words meant so much more than I could ever have imagined at the time that I heard them.

""Good bye, David. It was fun.""

They've stopped trying to breach the compound, thank the stars. We've nearly run out of ammunition. After redistribution each of our rifles has only three bullets, no more, no less. I'm not sure what they're trying to do outside. We only need a few more days and the Work will be complete. 

Day 31 of the siege

It seems my optimism was unfounded before. We need supplies to finish the Work, but the forces of stagnation stand in our way. I will not allow them to ruin what we have started.

Day 35 of the siege

I had feared that I would not be able to make another entry. Three days ago I left the compound, intent on returning with the fuel needed to finish the Work. What I found terrified me. Vehicles abandoned. The sky burned. Truly only the Work will save us. I siphoned as much as I could bring back. We'll be able to run the generators for days. I pray to the stars that it'll be enough.

Day 42 of the end. 

The Work is completed. I saw its beauty with my own eyes. It unfurled its wings and took to the sky, free to complete it's task and save our world. Free it from wherever evil burned out the sky and took the rest of man. I only pray that it'll be enough.",Not_A_Master

"[WP] Three bullets. No more, no less.",Theminonking,"I can hear the door frame splinter as they kick the front door down. ""I want you to find him! nobody gets away from us!"" Hiding on the second floor was a rookie mistake, didn't give myself an escape route. Check the magazine in my gun two in the mag one in the chamber, and judging by the sound coming from downstairs there’s a lot more than three people down there.  

One of them is coming up the stairs, I've got a few seconds to decide how I'm going to handle this. before I can figure it out he's up the stairs and walking past the door frame I'm hiding behind, I start moving and before I can think I have the man in a choke hold and my gun against his head.

""say a word I blow your head off,"" I direct my new meat shield towards the stairs where I see five people standing at the bottom, three of them have guns drawn the other two seem a pipe and a blood stained baseball bat. I point my gun at the group ""back off or your buddy here gets it.""

""I don't believe you actually have any bullets in that gun,"" a sixth man says as he walks  into the hallway ""you already took quite a few shots at us when you fell into our trap, and bullets are a rare commodity nowadays.""

""I guess that's for me to know and you to find out hu?"" I take a few steps down the stairs the small group assembled takes a few back. I get tunnel vision all I can focus on is the open door behind the group, my second mistake one of them fires  I can feel the bullet go right through my shield into my shoulder. On reflex fire back at them hitting one of them in the leg he drops to the ground, another man open fire his gun is a lower caliber the bullets don't make it through the shield. I fire at him, his brains fly out the back of his head he's not getting up. struggling to keep the now dead shield up I shout ""who else wants to die!""

""You killed my brother you son of a bitch!"" the guy with the pipe charges at me I wait until he gets close and pull the trigger he falls dead. I push forward passing the man with a bullet hole in his leg I kick away his gun, I get close to the last man with a gun.

""you'll drop that and kick it away if you're smart."" Thankfully he listens to me, third mistake it gives the guy with a bat an opening he charges at me while I'm distracted. I do the only thing I can think of and throw my shield at him it stumbles him enough that I'm able to get past him, but the next thing I know I'm being grappled by the sixth man he manages to wrestle the gun out of my hand and throws me down to the ground. I'm laying on the ground staring up at my own gun pointed at me then it hear it.

""Click"" the man looks at my gun and chuckles slightly

""Can't really say I was right you did have bullets, just not a full clip,"" he tosses my gun into another room. ""But unlike you,"" he pulls a gun out of his jacket, ""I do have a full clip."" He points the at me and chuckles again to himself, ""three bullets.""

"[WP] Three bullets. No more, no less.",Theminonking,"*Again, nothing.  The smell of gunpowder faintly laced with iron.  That buzzing in your ear as the silence settles in.  Dust, and a long sweet ""goodnight"".*

A ramshackle old Ford barrels past.  Brenton Wood's ""Gimme a Little Sign"" caterwauling for what seems like miles in every direction.  One dog barking, two dogs barking, then three, *now everyone, all together!*  K reaches towards the rust-bottomed cooler (inexplicably emblazoned with ""Exactitude"" in large white bubble letters), head cocked, glaring as the Ford bounces through the pocked-marked intersection at Storm and Drang.  The cooler yawns.

Sun limps out from behind a column of deep cream-colored clouds; a languid breeze unfurls in long streaming ribbons.  Brenton Wood slowly dying in the distance.  ""And show me that your mine girl, oh yeah.  Just gimme some kind of...""  Then nothing.

K leans back on the old chaise.  ""This beer"", he says, ""this beer here, is as cold as it is wet.  Now ain't that just how he likes em'?""  Laughs gently, and then smiles.  (Singing) ""Yes it is.  Yes it is.""  

The last dog yawps wildly for the last time.  K knocks back the bottle as if in celebration.  Sun disappears again, but just for a moment.  K reaches between the cooler and the edge of the chaise for a pack of cigarettes that should have been there, but were not.  He crumples into a more acute sideways lean.  He scans the still cool cement with the tips of his fingers.  Nothing but a thin veil of dirt or ash, a folded bottle cap and a flattened butt end.  *Left them in the car?  Where else?  Haven't been inside for hours.*  Doubtful, he pops up from the chaise and off the cement step in a single motion (which would have struck any onlooker, if indeed there was one, as oddly elegant, almost gymnastic, though not quite), and hustles towards the white Dodge parked in the shade of a lone tree of no particular importance.

As K nears the edge of the long strip of dead grass between porch and road, something catches his ear.  He is now stopped.  Barely audible, something in the distance returns to him, unexpectedly.  He is still not moving.  It finally arrives, ever so faint, and as if now unrestrained returns to where it was just a few minutes before.

""...Sign girl, oh my baby, To show me that your mine girl, All right.  Just gimme some kind of sign girl
Oh my baby, To show me that you're mine girl, All right.""  Now Refrain.

K is still not moving.  Not because something in particular occurs to him beyond what has already been mentioned.  Nothing occurs to him more than the return of something assumed to be gone.  This is perhaps odd, but not so odd as to be anything more than curious, and trivially so.  And yet, the man named K is still not moving.

A few moments later, in broken synchronicity, the old Ford lurches into view along with the final few stanzas of the refrain (its volume, now clearly within earshot, simultaneously receding as the track fades to an end).  It rolls silently toward the white Dodge.  The driver, a man, has no hair and wears mirror-lensed aviators with gold wire frames.  As he nears a full stop directly in front of the white Dodge, directly in front of K, he smiles.  His teeth do not look like teeth.  They are placed in his mouth as teeth would be, but they are the wrong color, the wrong shape.  If K had to guess, in that moment, he would say that those were not at all teeth, but old iron musket balls (their surface seemed dented and speckled with rust-colored pitting).  But he did not think that this was possible, for a man to have such teeth, for a man cannot have musket balls for teeth.

The man leaned back.  For a moment he stared up towards the ceiling, before abruptly removing his sunglasses as he turned away from K.  With one hand he opened the door, with the other he placed the sunglasses back over his eyes.  He walked towards the front of the truck and then towards K.  He wore tailored black pants and a long-sleeved white shirt.  He wore no shoes or socks.  He was tall, but not remarkably so, and his build was that of a moderately fit man.  His age was not apparent.

When he got about five feet from where K was standing, he stopped.  The two men stood motionless like ancient statues, as if the moment itself had turned them both to stone.  K, lost in his own reflection peering back at him unnervingly from the broad dome of the man's sunglasses, didn't notice that the man had reached behind, his arm now lurching back toward K.  He did not see the long slender barrel of the Colt Python until the dark hole of the muzzle filled the frame of those broad domes.  When he finally looked down, he saw the man, the muzzle, the polished cylinder, all staring back at him, blank as a stone.  He noticed too the chambers of the cylinder, jutting out laterally from the frame of the revolver.  There were three chambers empty, three chambers full.

The man spoke.

""Three bullets.  No more, no less.""

Then he smiled.

[IP] Showdown.,TigerBroseff,"There had been movements, large shifts of waves coming form deep under the ocean It came from the blank a section of the sea that was extremely unexplored. The Thursday Aesir had spent her life preparing for this, diving into the darkness a area they had found fish did not want to go. The Discovery of the shape made them think that it was abnormal plate activity. 

Wanting to be the first to observe the event in person, Thursday and her colleagues took a boat into the Blank over the active site. Despite having a clear sky's and warm weather the waves were choppy and had made the boat jerk semi-violently as the ploughed through the water. Getting ready to dive in Thursday striped everything but her wet-suit, making sure that all her gear was in top shape before putting on her flippers before putting on her scuba tank and googles. Calming herself with the motions of the boat she grabs her Harpoon before sliding of the edge into the abyss. Sinking under the waves, the diver shook shaking as the water pushed her back thrashing like a wild beast instead of the pull of a current.

As she swam what she saw surprised her the source was not something natural like a eruption it was the actions on a gigantic Eel a serpent so large it could have crushed her boat with a swipe of her tail. Noticing the invader in its territory the face of the beast come into view, opening its mouth a large bubbles floated out as it bared its teeth. Each fang that inhabited its mouth were large and yellow with entire parts crusted in algae. Gliding through the water large sections of its body shimmered with a dull glow like bronze an copper. As my body drifted back towards its eyes large pools of Lapis Lazili it great size made it obvious how this showdown would end as it started to move closer. Trying to send up a picture before she died she pressed a button on her googles before hearing the entire sea shake as she heard.

[WP] You encounter someone from the future... But just by ten years.,Userwompwomp,"When I was younger, I'd always wonder what I'd be in ten years. I'd ponder how I'd act, what jobs I'd have, and the feats I accomplished. As a now 14 year old, I have yet to accomplish any of the goals I had set out to complete, and after seeing someone that's ten years ahead of us, I can safely say that it'll be impossible for us to conquer these goals in the near distant future. 

After being chosen to examine and talk to a human from 2026, I was excited about seeing the advancements in technology we've made. ""Can we fly?"" ""Will we possess new weaponry to wipe out our enemies?"" Questions like these bounced around in my head like it was a trampoline, and I could hardly contain my excitement. 

Excitement and anticipation turned to depression and anxiety after I came into contact with our future. The person I had imagined was not a person, but a robot. A robot tasked to wipe out the world. I had so many questions, but only assumptions could be made as the thing that say in front of me couldn't talk. 

On the back was a creation date, much like the labels on some toys. I would've put this experience in the back of my mind and continued going on with my life if I hadn't read the back. I'd have ten years ahead of me, that's tons time to prepare for these inventions and attempt to prepare to fight them off, right? This whole situation would've been avoidable if I hadn't read the numbers etched on the robots back.

Just darkness. Darkness, and a...floor?

I reached out and touched it. Not *down*, but definitely a floor.

The floor, though infinite, was as sharp at six miles away as it was six inches away. Which didn't make sense. How could distant things not be less defined than close things?

""That's because they are *defined*.""

He glanced around, and there was an old man standing near him. The man's wild white hair and bushy moustache looked oddly familiar, but I couldn't place where I knew them.

""How did you know I was wondering?""

The old man laughed. ""Oh, that's easy. Your thoughts are *defined*, too. Everything here is *defined*, rather than just *being*. It's a nice and scientific way to live.""

""Wait, how does that work?""

The old man laughed again, almost drunk. ""You're in a *Gedankenexperiment*. You're probably here because human bodies are convenient masses to teach Newton's laws to physics students.""

""And you?""

""I'm supposed to be Albert Einstein, only the teacher who's positing the *Gedank* doesn't actually know what Albert Einstein was like, aside from the picture in the classroom.""

I looked up suddenly, and sure enough, there was a giant amorphous blob named **M1** falling towards us. I panicked, and Einstein reassured me.

Chief Lyle motioned me over from his office. I had just grabbed a bagel from the break-room that I was scarfing down on my way to the lobby. Chive and onion cream cheese on a sesame seed bagel always gets my day started off right. I had just chomped down on my last bite as I turned into his office and saw he had company.

*munch*""Sir?""

""Cut the 'sir' shit, Goss"", he smirked, looking over at the person beside him. ""Goss, this is Detective Inniss. Inniss, meet Detective Goss.""

""Pleased to meet you, Goss""

Inniss reached out for a handshake. I was still chewing the bagel but managed to muffle a word.

""Likewise.""

We shook hands and I scanned Inniss over. Inniss actually looked sort of familiar. I couldn't quite put my finger on it but I had the strangest feeling I've seen this g-OH MY GOD!!

The chief let out a slight chuckle. I must have had a crazy expression on my face.

""Figured it out did ya? Inniss just came down from Paterson but knows the area.""

My look of disbelief was returning back to normal proportions. I couldn't believe I was standing in front of the first person I arrested when I joined the force.

""Goss, you've been working on the Filzer case for a while and I thought it would be a good opportunity to get some fresh eyes on it. Inniss has quite the reputation for keen eyes and out-of-the-box thinking.""

My look of disbelief returned two-fold. I pulled Chief Lyle by the elbow and turned him away from Inniss who was looking on amused.

""Chief, with all due respect, I've got a handle on this case. I'm THIS close, to identifying the unsub and I've already got leads on his whereabouts, let me just-""

""No can do! The mayor's already on my ass about the case and about Deputy Lasko's hijinks last week, so she requested additional resources. Until further notice, Inniss is your partner. You've done it before and had the same reaction, get over it and work together.""

I stared angrily at the Chief and huffed. I cleared my throat and turned to Inniss, who was pretending like our conversation wasn't overheard just now.

""Alright... well, let's get going then. Chief?"" I looked over in case he had anything else up his sleeve.

""Go ahead, get Inniss briefed and work out your, uh... history.""

--------------------------------

We didn't say much in the car, I kind of just stared ahead as I drove. We were headed for my favorite diner where I go to pore over my paperwork and figure stuff out. It'd been a good 10 minute drive without a word spoken. Peaceful.

""So where are we headed,"" Inniss interrupted my peace with curiosity while taking in the sights of the neighborhood streets.

""Luke's diner,"" I said dryly.

""The one on-""

""8th and Orange Blossom,"" I interrupted sharply. ""Yep.""

Inniss took the hint and kept looking out the window, occasionally glancing forward but never at me.

I despised the idea of having Inniss be my partner. We're nothing alike and given our past it wasn't likely we were really going to get along. Let alone what would happen if my brothers found out what actually occurred the night I arrested Inniss. I visibly shuddered.

Luke's was just up ahead on the right. I pulled into the lot and parked in the back near the oak tree and shut the engine off. We sat for a few minutes being completely silent.

""People walking, and talking, what are you on about?""

""Look"" he said, pointing across the sky gap; the shuttle was docking in.

""It the shuttle, the shuttle that we should BE on Wyatt..."" she said, he face flushed red

""You'll thank me later Marley,"" he yawned, flicking his cigarette down towards the Tier One slums 

""We're going to be late, on our first day....I thought you wanted to be apart of the resistance, this isn't how to make a good first impression"" Marley said in despair 

""Who's operating that shuttle Marley?"" He asked ""Look""

She peer over the railing to get a better view, ""I don't know, some operator"" she yelled, ""he looks normal to me, what's your point?"" she looked over to Wyatt. He was gone. 

She spun her head frantically. He was walking towards the shuttle, down the Ledge. She walked towards him at a brisk pace, swiftly making her way through the crowd. 

He stopped directly across from the shuttle. He looked over to her.

""Can you please fill me in? What are on to?"" she asked

He nodded towards the shuttle. The operator had moved from the drivers seat to the middle cab. He was crouched over one of the seats. 

""What his he doing?"" Marley whispered but Wyatt stayed silent, carefully onlooking the shuttle driver. 

""He's going to run"" Wyatt said in a hushed voice to what seemed like himself. Sure enough the operator bolted out from the side doors of the shuttle.

""No, no, no"" Marley said, quivering in fear,""what did he do?""

""Exactly what you're thinking""

Wyatt ran into the shop behind him. He came out with a hand full of firecrackers. He lit them up and inconspicuously placed them across the Ledge. Pop, pop, pop. 

""Run! There's a shooter!"" Wyatt yelled

People listened and ran into closest stores to them. Marley help direct the traffic to the nearest exit from the Ledge.

""RUN, get off the Ledge! Go! Go!"" Marley screamed.

The bomb went off.

[IP] What is this conversation all about and what are their names?,anon33249038,"Charney took a long drag of his cigarette and tried to focus on the conversation.

“I mean, can you believe that we’ve lived to see the day?”, said Gayma. “Actual intelligent life in the universe. Not counting humans of course.”

Charney watched clouds race by in the winds created by artificial fans high in the dome. “That’s if we are classifying humans as intelligent life.”

“So it’s a ‘glass half-fucked type of day, eh.”

“Sorry. Shit day at the office.” He turned and looked at her. “The food dispensers sprayed strawberry Jell-o all over the lower decks. It took most the day to find the glitch in the master circuit.”

Gayma groaned for him.

“But--you should have seen the rush hour traffic slip and slide. One guy face planted into the cleavage of a woman who’d fallen in front of him. Genius.”

They both laughed until the railing was the only support to stay upright. Gayma reached over and grabbed his cigarette. She took a small drag.

“We have no idea of their intentions, the aliens. They could give us the cure to all diseases, or enslave us. If there is one thing I believe in, it’s this: intelligent beings become intelligent through competition, and competition breeds the need to assert superiority.”, he said.

“You know I hate to agree with you, especially considering the sky is purple, but I’m scared of that as well.”

A shadow stretched across the city, and the inhabitants looked up in unison. Above them was a ship larger than the entire fleet housed on their colony. There was no discernible technology on the outside of its triangular shape. The hull was covered in a smooth polished metal without breaks.

[IP] What is this conversation all about and what are their names?,anon33249038,"Frank Tupelo arrived at his quarters tired and hungry, but his mind wandered from his physical ailments to the holotape in one of his greasy coverall's pockets.  He had gotten used to the grind, the daily life of the working class, and strangely enough he had come to find that he enjoyed it.  If the younger version of himself on that holotape could see him now he probably would have cussed him out and called him a no good wage-monkey.  Back in those days he and Yulyana had been thick as thieves, partly because they literally were thieves and it helped to have a friend that had your back in that business.  Especially in Lowtown. 

Things were different now though, Frankie was a wager and Yu had gotten involved with some underground movement and they barely saw each other anymore.  In fact that conversation on the tube platform balcony was was the first time they had spoken in several months.  Lately it seemed that she only sought him out when she needed something.  Though he supposed he was as much to blame for them growing apart as she was.  If she didn't come around asking a favor now and then he would probably never see her.  It didn't help that she rarely stayed in one place for long.  Olympus was the biggest settlement in the system, and people said that it even dwarfed most of the cities on Earth, so it was easy to lose track of people if you didn't keep up with them. 

Frankie tossed his bag on the piece of furniture that served as his bed and couch, and slumped himself down in a heap next to it.  He rubbed at his temples for a moment to quiet the throbbing that had been building up there over the course of the day.  After a moment of silence he leaned forward and flicked on the power switch of his console.  His quarters were extremely modest, in fact if he lay down horizontally his feet and head would nearly be touching the walls.  His possessions were few and shabby for the most part, but his console was a point of personal pride.  He had cobbled it together mostly from spare parts he scavenged from the tube yard so it wasn't pretty, but it was powerful.  

He put the holotape in the console's drive and booted up a media player.  He hesitated with his cursor over the file for a moment, but in the end selected it and started the recording.  

""OK Yulyana Gregorovich along with Frankie Tupelo, say hi Frankie!"" a very young Yulyana shoved Frankie in front of the camera.

""H-hi, I'm Frankie Tupelo,"" Frankie chuckled at the sight of himself.  He was dirty, his hair matted and his clothes were little more than rags, but there was a light of childish hope in his eyes that even the slums of Lowtown hadn't managed to snuff out.

""And we are here doing this recording for posterior-""

""Posterity... the word is posterity,"" Young Frankie interjected.

""Whatever nerd!"" Yulyana interrupted her speech to sock Frankie in the shoulder several times sending them both into a fit of laughter.  ""*Anywaaaays*, we are doing this recording for *posterity* so that all you can see what we were like before we became the most rich and famous people on Olympus!""  

Frankie watched himself and Yu lay out a ridiculous plan for rising up through the social echelons of Olympus that only a couple of kids could have come up with.  Yu envisioned herself becoming an incredibly successful pop star as a coverup for her real career as an infamous jewel thief.  Frankie was going to be her manager in the pop star career, while providing her with all the high tech gadgets she needed for the thievery side business.  Things hadn't worked out that way, but there was something in the confident proclamations of his best friend that made him feel like it was still possible somehow.  

The recording ended and Frankie realized that he had gotten even hungrier as he watched the video without noticing it so he decided to fill his belly before he thought any more about Yulyana's proposition.  He made his way to the food processor and pawed through the few food packets he had remaining in the drawer.  

""Salisbury steak, Salisbury steak and oh look!  ...Salisbury steak.  Why the hell did I even buy this garbage..."" Frankie sighed.  He decided that a little fresh air and human interaction would help him clear his head, so he grabbed a jacket and headed out the door towards Hanbe's. 

When Frankie arrived at the noodle shop the place was already incredibly crowded.  Frankie shouldered his way through the gawkers and tourists to find a place in line.  He thought about the shy boy in the video, and how he would never have been able to go into a place like this without Yulyana leading the way, and smiled.  The buzz of activity and conversation wafted over him and he recognized the affected accent of Zenith elites, the grungy patois of Lowtown wagers, along with the Middleton dialect he had become so used to over the past year and a smattering of Earth languages as well.  When he reached the counter he was greeted by a shiny chrome android wearing a chef's hat and a garish bowtie patterned with Japanese Kanji.  

""Looks like the gawks and spacies are keepin ya busy Hanbe!"" said Frankie over the din of the crowd.

""Haha well I'll be dammned, Frankie Tupelo!"" The android's facial display turned into a toothy grin and he laughed in a metallic baritone, ""You hit the nail on the head my boy, but I am never too busy to make a bowl of Tonkotsu for my favorite customer."" 

""You know me too well Hanbe, hit me hard with the spicy tonight and send a bottle of cold Sake my way while you're at it."" 

""Been workin ya hard at the tube yard have they?"" Hanbe asked as his torso rotated to face the kitchen and his limbs busied themselves with a hundred different tasks at once.  ""You tell those bastards if they don't start paying you the overtime you deserve they can get their ramen somewhere else!"" 

""Hanbe you are too damn good to me.  What do I owe ya?""

""This one's on the house Frankie,""  Frankie started to protest but the android quickly cut him off. ""C'mon it is the least I can do for the man who saved my life.  Have a seat and quit whining!  Your stool is free as always."" 

Frankie made his way carefully through the throng of people eating their noodles, some even eating standing up between the tables for lack of room, and sat himself on a stool behind the counter in the kitchen.  In no time a steaming hot bowl of tonkotsu ramen cam sliding down the bar accompanied by a large bottle of sake and a glass.  Frankie dug in with the zeal of a man who hadn't eaten all day and had made it through about half the bowl before he came up for a breath and a drink of the sake.  

""You know it isn't going to run away if you don't eat it fast enough."" A girl with bright green hair that was tied up in a bun held in place by sequinned chopsticks was staring at him smiling. 

""Haha, yeah.  What can I say Hanbe's is the best!  It seems like it'd be a shame to let it get cold.""  

""Well I suppose I would have to agree with you there.""  The girl helped herself to a mouthful of her own dish as if to accentuate the point. ""So how did you get the special seat behind the counter while the rest of us have to kill each other for a place to sit?""

""Oh it wasn't a big deal really.  Some Zenith religious nuts dropped a malware bomb on Hanbe's mainframe a few months back and I cleared it up for him,"" Frankie explained between mouthfuls.  

""Wow, that is pretty jacked up,"" the girl shook her head thoughtfully.  ""People up there really hate AI's that much?""

""Well, I think it is more the fact that they are scared of them.  I mean there is a reason that they come down here to watch him do his thing.  They are fascinated by Androids and happy to use their dumbed down ones, but they would rather keep the sentient ones down here on Middleton so they can come gawk at them like animals in a zoo whenever they feel like it without feeling threatened."" 

""Geez, that is crazy.  I am so glad I am not like those stuck up jerks,"" Frankie nodded slightly in agreement.  ""Although there is a lot of Lowtrash here too.  I guess I can't blame them for getting excited at the sight of a real AI.  Most of them have probably never seen one huh?""

Frankie flinched at the casual use of the slur, but held his composure.  This girl was just a product of the perverted caste system in Olympus, she couldn't be blamed for something that had been ingrained in her mind since she was a child. 

""Yeah, there are androids here and there in Lowtown but most people will never see one,"" Frankie explained quietly.  

""Well, it's been nice talkin to ya but I gotta run to meet some friends.  Hit me up some time if you want to chill Mr..."" 

""Frankie""

""Frankie.  Nice to meet ya.  I'm Miriel,"" the girl gave him a flirtatious wink as she slid him a piece of napkin with her number written on it encircled by a heart.  Frankie waited until she was out of sight before crumpling up the napkin and throwing it in a nearby trash can.  He had been right, a little human interaction did help him clear his head.  Yulyana had also been right.  Nothing was going to change unless someone stepped up to change it.  He didn't know if that person was him, but he made up his mind that he had to try.

[IP] What is this conversation all about and what are their names?,anon33249038,"""Come *on,* Derrick. You can't be serious."" The young woman turned a long-suffering gaze to her companion, looking wistfully over the railing. All around, the clamor of the Upper Level surrounded them, the city as alive as ever.

The man beside her took his cigarette from his mouth, ashing it and watching the embers drift down, past the train rumbling below the walkway, towards the Lower City. Behind the pair, the restaurant attendant barked something to someone else in his shop, the words snatched away by the murmur of voices passing by them.

He blew out a cloud of smoke, watching as the passing air current grabbed and stretched it, taking it towards the distant megalopolis. ""'Course I am, Ky. You know I'm always serious.""

She rolled her eyes, watching the train pull into the station across the air gap. ""Yeah, serious as a misaligned pulse core, that's our Derrick,"" she huffed sarcastically.

Derrick didn't respond immediately, his eyes tracking an *Aegis*-class transport as it lumbered its way towards the landing yards.

""Derrick, you *promised* me. You *promised* you wouldn't get caught up with them again."" She shifted her tactic to pouting at him, brushing a lock of hair from her eyes.

""One more job, Ky."" He turned to face her, smiling easily. When she didn't drop her pout, his grin faded. ""I promise. One more job for Shinryu, then I won't take work in the Lower City again.""

Finally, after a moment, she relented, a rueful expression spreading across her face. ""Yeah, that's what you said the *last* two times.""

""Hey, I didn't see *you* complaining when it came time to cash out,"" he teased, ruffling her hair.

""Oh, go jump in a warp drive,"" she said with no rancor, batting his hand away. ""...Fine.""

""So you'll do it?"" he asked, after another long drag.

""Like I have a choice,"" she said, her arm going around his waist. ""*Someone* has to keep you above water.""

Derrick nodded, ashing his cigarette again and dropping it, letting it fall past the train, into the haze and perpetual smog of the Lower City. ""Let's go, then.""

The pair stepped back from the railing and melted into the crowd...",Claymore729
[IP] What is this conversation all about and what are their names?,anon33249038,"""...I mean do you Frankie?  Frankie?  Are you even listening to me?""  The red haired youth cuffed her companion lightly on the back of his head nearly making the lit cigarette fall out of his mouth. 

""What the fuck Yu?"" Frankie rubbed the spot where she smacked him, ""I'm listening damn... I am just tired.  It is hard to focus after a 12 hour shift.""

""I see that look in your eyes.  Is that supposed to be some kind of slight?""  Yulyana shot him an icy glare, ""Just because Frankie Tupelo is on the straight and narrow now with his big important tube-tech job he can't be bothered to associate with us gutter rats anymore?""  

""C'mon Yu it isn't like that.  I am honestly just real tired.""  Frankie took a leisurely drag and exhaled the smoke out over the yawning abyss of Lowtown.  

""I was thinking about the old days, down there."" He nodded towards the slums some thousand or so meters below. ""Things were simpler ya know?""

""Yeah I know Frankie,"" Yulyana's features softened, ""But things are different now.  We aren't kids anymore.  Some of us want to be part of something bigger.  This isn't about fleecing some strangers to make enough dough to eat, this is a chance for street trash like us to really make a difference in this city.""

""Can we really make a difference though? Anything you destroy, any changes you think you are gonna make, the big rich bastards in Zenith can just rebuild and restructure back to the way they want it in no time.""  Frankie's voice fell, heavy with the weight of hard work and dreams that never made it past Middleton. ""I just wanna live my life Yu.  I have accepted that this is probably as far as I am gonna go, but I am ok with that.  I ain't hungry anymore.  I got my own place.  I... I'm happy."" 

Yulyana let out a huge sigh as she stared out over the emptiness.  She didn't look down at Lowtown though.  Her eyes were trained at the high spires and ceilings of Zenith looming above them.  ""Frankie... I understand where you are coming from.  I really do.  I don't dream about making it up there anymore.  I know more about the world we live in than you give me credit for.  That is why I know something has got to change.  Those people up there aren't gonna do it, and neither are your Middleton friends.  It has to be us.  The people who came from the bottom.  We are the only ones who can see the whole picture.""  

Yulyana put something in Frankie's hand and started to walk away.  ""Think about it Frankie, no one is asking you to make a decision now.""  He looked at what she had given him.  It was a holotape labeled, ""Frankie and Yu's plan to get to the top part 1!"".  He smiled as a wave of memory washed over him.  

""And Frankie, just know.  You aren't one of these people, no matter how much they act like they like you, you will always be just another kid from Lowtown to them."" She gave him a sad smile and disappeared into the shifting crowd.

[IP] What is this conversation all about and what are their names?,anon33249038,"""Why you? There's no way you'll survive this, someone else can do it."" 

Jax took a long drag from his cigarette then exhaled slowly. ""Who else? Someone has to take those bastards down, and I can't rely on anyone else.""

His companion sighed. ""I know how much this means to you, but what if there was another way?""

""Like what? We tried *everything*. I don't want to be doing this. I don't want to die, and I don't want to be remembered as a terrorist, but how else can I make a difference? Diplomacy doesn't work when people won't listen to reason. The protests failed after they were made illegal. We tried undermining them peacefully. This is all that's left. I'm sorry Sara.""

Sara turned her face away, her red hair hiding the tears in her eyes. ""Maybe this isn't even as noble a cause as we thought at the start. Life isn't so bad for us.""

""Look around you, Sara."" Jax waved his hand at the row of ramshackle shops behind them. ""This is a fucking slum. It's not as bad as on the ground, but just look up there. Look at our overlords controlling us, keeping everything for themselves."" He glared hatefully at the towering buildings rising over his right shoulder. ""They sit up there and piss on us as we suffer and die, and those below us suffer worse and die sooner.""

Sara looked over the rail at the dark smoke-filled streets below. She knew he was right, no matter how much she hated it. She had been there herself, she had seen the starving people hurry through the waste and vermin, just as she had been into the cloud quarter once. 

The cloud quarter was where clean corridors ran through the towers owned by the wealthiest of the city's patrons. The denizens of the cloud quarter always took priority. When food was scarce everywhere else, those in the cloud quarter feasted. When medical supplies were running out, a Cloudie won't have to worry about missing out on the latest cosmetic surgery. When a Cloudie wanted something, they would steal it from a Mid-tier or work the Ground Dwellers to death to make it. The Cloudies could do what they wanted to anyone below them, with no repercussions. 

That would soon change. There had been whispers for years on the ground, concerning banned philosophy, which had spread like wildfire up to the mid-tier. Now they were finally ready to move and Jax was on his way to cast the first stone.

Sara turned to look at him one last time. Neither of them spoke a word. Jax put out his cigarette as the bus pulled near. They embraced, but then Jax pulled away. Sara knew he had to go, but it still hurt. He boarded the transport, looking back at her as the door closed.

She wept as the lights disappeared into the distance. The price of freedom was heavy.",SophieOfTarth
"[WP] Sometime in the future, movies created by the mind of the watcher are reality. They plug in and watch a movie tailor made for them by their brains. Most films last an hour or two. One day, a man plugs in and his movie never stops.",azclimberman,"""It's been seventeen hours. You gotta snap out of this.""

Chris lays a firm grasp on his friend's shoulder, hoping to connect with the man on the other side. But Zack is too far out to hear him; he's drooling on the collar with a serene bliss on his face.

Zack's wife Debbie stands over the machine, holding his hand. ""This is wrong. Are you telling me the machine opt-out does nothing?""

""Well, what the opt-out does is inserting random elements into the movie, and relying on the user's inherent ability to be alerted by the lack of flow. Zack's supposed to end up feeling disconnected from the movie, and in turn the virtual reality.""

""So why doesn't it work?""

Chris checks the data collection, and he throws Debbie a hopeless glance:

""He doesn't seem to mind it.""

Debbie looks at the screen. There are faint but recognisable still images reconstructed from neural signals. She recognises silhouettes of ninjas, vikings, robots, and muscly men. And scantily-dressed women. A lot of them. But while risqué experiences aren't surprising, it still isn't much to look at, for there isn't a lot colour, or light at all. The images jump constantly, and Debbie fails to see how they can possibly connect to form a ""movie"". A slideshow can't possibly be *that* engrossing, she thinks.

""You need to think about this, Debbie. The average man usually auto-disconnects after five hours. A brain can't take that much without rest. We don't know what will happen if he keeps going.""

Debbie looks at Zack's euphoric expression, and thinks about the irony of it all. She finally glances up at Chris. ""Why can't you help him?""

""I'm thinking. This has never happened before.""

""No, I mean why won't you help him! Why didn't you see this coming? You did this to Zack. You, and the machines.""

Chris sighs and stares into nothing. He knows she's right. He should have seen it coming from a mile away. Letting Zack handle the machine without learning the ropes first. But how could he have known? Well, on one hand Zack's always been a bright man, but on the other, his mind is a troublesome place.

""What are you proposing?"" asks a desperate Debbie.

""If nothing's working... We've got to consider pulling the plug.""

""No!"" yells Debbie. She couldn't possibly run with such a risky option when the fate of her husband's on the line. She kisses him, and stares into his soulless face. ""The machines have ruined you. But I won't let go, Zack."" 

Chris feels sorry and helpless. Looking at Debbie's tears, he wishes he could help them, even if that means sacrificing himself...

Wait, there is another way.

Debbie looks up, her mascara in ruins. Chris reconsiders his idea. He's done it before, but never on this scale. Finally, he makes his decision.

""Tie me to the machine. I'll go in after him and drag him out of this mess.""",GastricSparrow

""What you need to realize about them Fred is they are some of those Dark Souls folks.""

""How do you figure that explains things Sam?""

""Well, take a look right there, what did you see.""

""The demon rushed at him and swung at him and he just rolled right into the blade. It makes no sense.""

""There you have it, Dark Souls players really aren't any better or worse at this then us. They just have this strange notion that by rolling they can become invincible.""

""Shouldn't we help him then, maybe teach him what he is doing wrong?""

""Na Sam, see Dark Souls players also have this crazy notion that if they don't roll around in a pool of their own blood all their training will be lost. As long as the Dark Souls players are around they will constantly rush back and roll around the enemies, rolling, rolling and rolling until they roll into a sword they think can't hurt them, then rush back repeat it all over again.""

""But how does that explain why we shouldn't help them?""

""Simple Sam, cause while they are doing that the demon is over there getting rolled around rather then over here chopping us up, and we can talk about how silly these Dark Souls players are.""

""Wow Fred, you're right, this place is much better now that they have arrived!""

And so in that fateful age, the Demon was sealed away behind a wall of rolling Dark Souls players, and peace could finally return to all the lands.

This first demon, I've only beaten it three times in two hundred years, is a pretty stereotypical horned imp flying around breathing fire. It doesn't look too intimidating, but it can kill you almost instantly with that fire.

But this girl walked in... tense. She was crouched and glancing around. Not nervous like the standard newly damned, but like a hunter assessing her surroundings, looking for prey.

The demon landed silently behind her, and at this point, it wasn't worth crying out, she was already dead. But, just as it seemed about to scorch her, she dodged deftly out of the way and jumped into the air, landing onto it and snapping its neck. It crumpled and the damned cheered, but the best part? After she landed, she was just smiling.

The next demon killed her, and she burst, screaming, out of fire behind me.

""That was amazing for a newly damned. But that second demon gets a lot of people.""

She looked over at me, like she was working out a difficult puzzle. ""Is there a limit to how many times we come back?""

""No, or at least, nobody has ever reached it, why?""

This was my seven-hundred-fifty-second attempt at this new half-life in Hell. All it seemed to consist of was this horrid array of nightmarish ghouls in a sprawling landscape of various forms; tree demons in a wooded thicket, hydra in a placid pond, draconic monsters atop castle battlements. It didn't really matter which direction I decided to push myself. Death rushed to meet me around nearly every corner.

The first time was alarming, I admit. Ascending a staircase in the decaying ruins of what might have been a church or a theater just after my condemnation, I had run into a half-man, half-goat behemoth that crushed me underfoot almost before I'd noticed it was there. I found myself wondering briefly, as my life-force ebbed, what happened when one died in what was supposed to be the punishment of the already-dead. It didn't take long to find out -- I just ended up alive again, back where I'd first awoken in this hellscape.

Every death, the same thing: finding myself reviving at whatever place I had most recently camped out. The fires I lit seemed to always beckon me back when I felt my vitality suddenly cease.

This Hell seemed hopeless.

That was, at least, until the Savior arrived.

His entrance to Hell was foretold by glowing white runes on the ground near one of these horrible beasts. I cautiously approached it, certain it was a trap, like some of the notes on the ground that read ""Jump here"" but only led to an infinite chasm. To my surprise, when I touched the sign, a burly tower of a man with an enormous shield and a six-foot sword slowly faded into existence in front of me. Startled, I fell backwards to the ground, barely catching myself before cracking my skull. I didn't know his intent, so I scuttled away awkwardly.

""Don't worry about it, dude. I'm here to help. God sent me.""

I shook my head, confused, as the man approached me. Expecting the worst, I grimaced in anticipation of the blade surely about to bisect me.

Instead, he reached out a hand to help me up. ""The name is Havelbuster. I apparently died this week because I forgot to eat. Dark Souls III just came out and I was going HAM as fuck. I guess God figured you guys needed some help down here, so... here I am.""

My dread subsiding, I explained to him the Lovecraftian creature residing behind the wall of fog just down the hall.

Havelbuster strode confidently down the steps and pushed his way through the pea soup. I followed, certainly not half as confidently, but managed not to curl in fright as the horrid eight-limbed abomination roared its challenge.

The armored warrior charged without hesitation, immediately beginning to hack away at one of the tentacles flailing toward him. Rolling to avoid another tentacle's graceless swipe, Havelbuster's sword traced an arc that cleanly lopped off a good portion of the sucker-covered arm.

At that point, unfortunately, things went sideways.

Feeling emboldened by my metal-clad savior, I threw myself into the fray as well, forgetting that I had absolutely no armor, no weapon, and no skill with which to go toe-to-toe with this hideous mountain of flesh. It only mattered for a moment, though, because I took a blow to the chest with a barbed tentacle tip that pierced directly through my heart on its way out through my spine.

Paralyzed, bleeding not quite profusely by only the grace of the barb embedded within me, I tried to call to the shieldbearer weakly, sure that my voice wouldn't carry. He must have heard, though, because he turned, sweeping his edge through another whiplike extremity, and sighed heavily.

The river Styx flowed strong with the blood of the fallen, their bodies littering its crashing current. The river was also littered with the limbs and bodies of various beasts and demons, as was the norm. A demon turned from the river to face the Beast.

""My lord. I do not wish to alarm you...""

""...Alarm me?"" Lucifer responded, calmly.

""Yes, my lord. It seems their is one soul who has lived through the day.""

Lucifer's blackened heart seized and halted. He felt the rage of the Beast begin to grow inside of him. 

""What do you mean, you 'missed' one?""

""Yes, my lord, it seems our hordes were unable to kill this one. He seems to be incredibly skilled."" The demon replied, visibly shaking.

""The armor was supposed to have burdened him beyond movement, and all the weapons, how could he swing them so effectively?"" Lucifer asked, partially genuinely curious.

There was a long silence as the demon used his seer sight to peer down at the championing damned soul.

""He does bit don the armor... or anything."" The demon mentioned with a shudder. ""And no blade rests in his hands or on his hips. He's just running. And punching, everything.""

Lucifer stood up to address his court of the damned. ""We must not let this soul reach this chamber, close the seven seals, man your defences, show this soul that hell hath fury!""

Just as he sent out the command, the massive body of Baal the dragon came crashing through the main gate, fire spewing from open wounds, covering his underbelly, his eyes, torn from their sockets, probably lost to the fields of hellfire surrounding the fortress. 

For this injustice, Lucifer would not stand. As he walked toward the massive corpse to assume its shape, a small, frail man slid off its belly, and started thrashing the nearest Balor. The Balor tried fighting back, but his advances were parried and dodged with expert speed and precision, and only after seconds, the massive demon was reduced to nothing but flinders, as the small frail man shouted ""Yeeaaah! Fuck you, Satan!""

Lucifer did not appreciate being mistaken for such an ugly beast. 

""BOY."" he boomed ""He was not Satan. I AM SATAN. YOU DARE MARCH ON THE PRINCE OF DARKNESS?"" Lucifer began growing, spouting flame, and becoming his most terrifying in hopes of detering the small champion.

The small frail man looked up at his now awesome stature, and simply muttered something too quiet to hear. The whole court now stared, silent, down at the man, each member more afraid than the last, for what he had done to the Balor, and apparently, Baal. Lucifer spoke up. ""I'm sorry, we did not hear you, could you repeat yourself?""

The small frail man became visibly annoyed and yelled ""I thought I was done with you pieces of shit, this level is boring! I want a fucking challenge! Now come here so I can kill you, bitch!"" And with that he charged.

Lucifer was dumb struck, and as the little frail, naked man ran toward him and lept, he could not move to avoid him, paralyzed by the surprise of what was happening. The little man hit Lucifer's leg, and began climbing until the two were staring one another in the eye. The little man started punching The Beast in the eye, over an over, and he shrieked in pain as he tore the little man off, and with him, his own eye, as the little man had gotten a full grip on it. As he reeled away in pain, the little man shoved the eye in his mouth, and began eating it, and began his charge once more.

He attacked once again in the same fashion, climbing the leg and the torso, staring Lucifer in the other eye, and laughing and calling him a ""dumb bitch"" as he began to claw his second eye out. Except this time, Lucifer couldn't claw him off he couldn't do anything, as the little mans hands reached further and further into his head. Everything went numb and faint. And all of a sudden, Lucifer awoke at the mouth of the river Styx looking up at a wrought iron sign, reading ""Abondon All Hope, Ye Who Enter Here.""

Back at the smoldering corpse of the Beast, the frail man stood up, his arms charred from the boiling insides of his recently felled foe, and looked around at the demon, all staring at him in disbelief. He roared ""what the fuck are you looking at, come get some of this shit, you pussies! I'll fuck you up!""

The same demon who had been watching the river Styx now spoke up, more terrified than he was before. ""Strange sir, it is my duty to inform you... you are the rightful heir to the throne. Take it, and you shall be named Prince of Darkness.""

The small, frail man was silent for a moment as he pondered the idea for a moment, looked up, and replied 

""Nah fuck that, I hate city builders, just show me where the next level is. I think my brothers down here though, he loves city builders, I charge you to find him and make him the Prince. Or I'll fuckin come and find you, got it?""

The demon had no clue what the small man was talking about, but obliged, and set about his search after showing the man to the one road out of Hell. Just as he was leaving, the Demon asked the man his name, he thought for a second, and giggled as he replied ""ASS."" he turned toward the road, paused, and looked back, saying one last thing before he left. ""By the way dude, your final boss fight was far too easy. You gotta make that shit alot tougher for next time."" 

Those last words were all the demon heard; ""next time.""",BackSeatGremlin

Holy shit. Actual food? We start walking over there through the hot molten landscape. A patch of green grass appears ahead, and the tree in the middle. A ray of light shines onto the tree and the red apples shine like diamonds.

Nathan is about to step on the grass, and then a voice is heard.

""I wouldn't do that,"" she says.

We both turn around to see a girl standing by a large boulder, relaxed and calm. She's wearing a shirt and pants. The complete opposite of our chain armor and small swords we've gathered over the course of our hundreds of respawns.

""What?"" Nathan says. ""This is the first sign of fruit we've seen here.""

She rolls her eyes. ""I'm not stopping you,"" she tells him.

Nathan steps onto the grass, maybe a few dozen paces to reach the first low bearing fruit. I stay behind, curious as to why this girl who just got to Hell would tell us not to go for it. She seems... calm. I dig that.

I turn my attention back to Nathan who's almost at the tree. I see that the girl is standing more upright, watching closely.

And out of nowhere a demon comes charging right at Nathan. Larger than the last one we fought, he readies his huge sword that's encased in green fire, Nathan tries to dive, but the demon is to fast and cuts Nathan through the ribs. He starts screaming and yelling as the green fire encases over his body. Not even a moment later Nathan's body is gone.

""See,"" she says looking over to me.

Great, now I need to die again, just minutes from the last respawn. To my surprise the girl runs pass me in her jeans and shirt and towards the demon. The hell? The great demon readies it's sword and she dives pass him. Running in circles around the demon it keeps missing her. She grabs Nathans sword, but not his armor that lays on top of the pile of ash.

""Distract him!"" She yells.

I'm not sure of her plan but I grab a rock, it's burning my hand, and throw it at the demon. It's orange beady eyes turn towards me. I raise my sword and ready for it's charge as It growls and then picks up speed towards me. I dive behind a rock as the huge sword misses but takes out a chunk of the rock. Shit, now I've cornered myself. The demon turns and it's sword comes down towards me.

The sword gets blocked, that girl is standing in front of me. Now with her pants cut into short shorts and most of her shirt gone. Did she cut that herself with Nathan's sword? I jump out of the way and she pushes the green fire sword to the side. I watch in awe as she begins circling the large demon poking it in the ass with Nathan's tiny sword.

It goes on and on and on. 45 minutes later of poking it in the ass the demon screams and falls to the ground. 

I run to the girl. ""The hell?"" I say. ""No one has ever beaten a demon, how?"" I'm happy and pissed at the same time. Nathan and I tried so many times, he probably won't believe me.

""The less clothes the more armor. You shouldn't try it though.""

She grabs an orange fire with her hand and then it disappears.

""Soul farming is going to take fucking forever,"" she mumbles.

She starts walking off without saying another word. She might be going too that dark castle way off in the horizon, Nathan and I have died there many times. I grab Nathan's armor and double time it back to the girl to learn her ways.",mattcreation

The first Dark Souls player has just arrived to this hell, and soon nothing will be the same again.",greenfunkman,"When I first arrived in these plutonic pits, I could hardly comprehend the world I beheld. In this eternal Hell, having fought battle upon mounting battle, dying deaths in ways uncounted and undreamt in life, there is no Hope. No release. Death is but a door, and with every fall that brings one to it, they are kicked back to draw a new, sulphuric breath.

I had taken to carving a mark into my blade for each death from which I returned. I've had to take up a new blade long ago, after the first ran out of space to make my mark. It was when I was halfway through with my tenth that I met Wanda.

White runes lit up the blood-soaked rock upon which I'd fought my past three lives, facing a demon that towered as tall as a fortress. The runes caught my curiosity. They were something new to me then, and I knelt beside them and reached out. Upon touching them, a figure faded into being before me, as newcomers to the pits are wont to do.

At first, I didn't think much of him. He was shorter than even I, scrawny as a kid, and he had red marks on his neck. I thought he would die a blade's worth of deaths rather quickly. If I had known his name, I might not even have given him a sword. But I was wrong. I was so very, very wrong, and I thank Mithras to this day for that.

""Welcome to Hell, boy,"" I told him then, as I held out a sword for him. He looked at the blade with empty eyes, and gave me no response.

I thrust the blade's grip at him urgently, looking over my shoulder for the giant wreaking havoc upon my men. ""Take the blade, boy, I don't have time for your crisis! I have to take on these demon souls!""

That got a reaction out of him. He gripped the blade with both hands, tested its balance, and bowed his head at me. Then he began to roll. By Mithras, he rolled! Tucking his head in, he rolled over his shoulder and again and again! He rolled past the demon's legs and cut them, then rolled away before the demon could stomp down where he was mere second prior! His stamina must've rivalled the gods! What a hundred of us could not accomplish in a hundred lives, he accomplished in mere minutes.

When at last the demon fell and he stood straight again, covered in crimson blood from head to toe, I slowly approached him, my mouth ajar in wonder. ""Who... *what* are you?""

The young man smiled at me. ""Taiyō o tataeyo."" He said, raising his arms. He seemed to note my confusion at his language. He just laughed, and translated, ""PURAISU DA SAN!""

My eyes lit up, and a grin broke through the bloody clouds on my face. ""Praise the sun indeed.""",DirkRight

Sure they could just drop everyone in the pit to die over and over again, but I figure they didn't see the sport in that. So they give us weapons and some armor. Swords, axes, spears, one dumbass is running around with a flail. I think he's going for most deaths, crazy bastard. 

There isn't really an actual fighting, we all just take turns at the first beast getting killed one by one. There's enough of us that we can go up to an hour without getting killed, hopefully the folks upstairs don't find out how we're gaming the system.

Oh shit, it's my turn. Well time to do my duty.

I step forward to the face the Beast, some type of dragon/hydra/centaur/demon. Really fucked up. I raise my sword to indicate my readiness to battle, the Beast seems to follow battlefield protocol, very strange. The Beast raises its halberd about to strike when we here the gong from the top of the atrium: a new soul has entered, your first death in Hell is falling from the entrance. But strange, we don't hear any screaming.

""PRAISE THE SUNNNNNNNNNNN.""

A young man, no more than 22 descends into the pit claymore in hand in striking position. In one swipe he decapitates the Beast. He lands on his feet in an almost feline manor.

The impossible happened, someone actually did it. This young man killed the Beast. 

The young man stands and faces me, he smiles and nods. I see a wild look in his eye: not madness or reckless abandon created from a total loss of hope. In fact it's the opposite: hope. I see hope in his eyes.

The young man raises his sword to the end of the pit, the door opens at his command. He then turns his sword to all of us, in this moment we all make a silent vow to follow this stranger to whatever end.

The young man says only, ""Dragon ahead. Git gud.""

The first Dark Souls player has just arrived to this hell, and soon nothing will be the same again.",greenfunkman,"I spend sleepless nights wondering why I ended up here. Sloth? Greed? Envy? All I know is that I committed some atrocity in life to be forced in this living hell. Some days I find other cursed souls among the demon hordes, fighting for their life against some abomination or another. If I can, I'll join the fight, hoping to gain some solace as a savior. It all ends the same though. Disembowelment here, cracked skull there, and all the while we mend like Prometheus chained to Mount Olympus to be torn apart again.

It was like any other day when I saw a new damned soul in the blood red countryside. Most of us know the newly damned from the rest due to the shabbiness of equipment. Here stood a man with a wooden shield, a bow and arrow, and a club fashioned from a demon bone. Before I could introduce myself to this comrade at arms, two lesser demons materialized out of the rocks around the field. ""Get ready!"" I shouted to my soon to be killed friend. I had not noticed his bow was already drawn, poised to fell an arrow on our enemies. The shot glanced the rock demon as he charged at us. I managed to barley dodge the boulder hurled at me by the other. As I watched the inevitable crash that was about to happen, I said a silent prayer for the man before he became another bloodstain on the cold landscape.

The demon missed completely. The New Man had rolled out of the way of the thing. 

As if in awe itself, the pile of rock and hatred stood stunned and stupid. It was at that moment the New Man unleashed a battle cry, bashing his shield with his club. He smashed the beast in the back of the head with a loud crack, followed by a chopping motion of his shield. I soon forgot about the other demon before it grabbed me and hurled me towards the New Man. Blood began trickling into my eyes and my vision began to fade. The New Man tossed me a flask. ""Hurry up and drink! I need you to kite that other shit while I deal with Tons-O-Fun here!"" I do as the man says, feeling heat from the liquid inside the flask pour down my throat. In an instant, my wounds had healed! 

I could feel myself compelled to fight, I must survive. I will survive.  

I pull out my dagger and begin to charge my thrower, The New Man continuing his acrobatic show against his foe. The demon swings at me with a heavy arm and I managed to find myself behind it. I plunge my blade deep into its hide and witness it fall to the ground. At that moment, The New Man stood over his adversary with his shield, delivering a guillotine blow to the neck of the once towering figure. As the hit connected, the pile of stone became lifeless again.

This was the first death of a demon at that hands of a Lost Soul. The second was when I staggered the new rising demon with a kick, stabbing it in the cold heart. 

After the battle, the stones began to glow it a white light. Without hesitation, The New Man picked up the source of the light and crushed it in his hands. ""You better do the same. It might get worse from hereon out."" I heed his advice and lift up the stone from the ground. It is lighter than anything I had ever felt, yet heavy with power. I squeeze my hand around it, and a rush of power overwhelms me. ""What in the world was that?"" I ask The New Man, as if he where the one stumbling upon me in this landscape. ""Their soul."" he coldly answers. It was the first time in a long time that I had experienced something I though was gone. Something deep within that this place seemingly took from me long ago.

Hope.

The New Man then began writing something on the ground with a white stone. It glowed as bright as the demon soul we had just encountered. As he finished, a message appeared saying ""A dangerous enemy is nearby."" I dared not ask how he could do it, but I managed to summon the courage to ask him one thing.

""Who are you?""

The New Man looked at me, smiled, and said. 

""I am Gock Coblin 420. I am here to bring an end to this world. Praise the Mother Fucking Sun!""

Brian scooped up some infernal pollen from the ground and shoved it into the loading chamber of his custom-made flamethrower. A rather nondescript young adult, his untimely death in a car accident - coupled with the fact that he'd never accomplished anything of value in the short time he was alive - landed him on the shores of the River Acheron, near the border of Hell's domain. Compared to other souls relegated to that area - deemed the Uncommitted, for their failure to stand for either good or evil in life - he was unnaturally acquainted with being in a state of death.

""I'll need to find a more reliable source of fuel,"" he said to himself.

""If it's hellfire you're looking for, you're on the right track,"" came a voice from behind him.

Brian turned to his demonic companion. Sama'el, a corporal within the Legions of Hell, stood seven feet in height, had skin the color of flowing blood, and radiated pure malice with every step he took - still, he'd decided to follow this scrawny human. Whether this was out of curiosity or reverence, he wouldn't say.

This pair of adventurers, after following the length of the Acheron for some time, chose to navigate to the desolate, craggy cliffs overlooking the river. For Sama'el, this was nothing more than an unconventional patrol route - or it would be, if he were on duty. This was the first time in millennia that he'd sworn his blade to anyone other than Lucifer, though as far as the rest of the Vestibule Regiment was concerned, he was merely taking a long-deserved vacation.

For Brian, it would be his latest opportunity to assert his mastery over what he considered an elaborate game. To him, Hell was nothing more than the latest installment of Dark Souls, and he had more experience with the franchise than any other resident of this grim domain.

""As we move further away from the Vestibule, the dangers will only increase,"" Sama'el continued. ""Truly, there are many tortures - or challenges, as you call them - to be experienced outside the Circles of Hell. The insects you charred to a crisp back there were the least of your worries. For instance, the lair of the Great Ones lies ahead of us.""

""The Great Ones?"" Brian pressed inquisitively.

""Demons, like myself, only enormous in stature and lacking in conventional intelligence. Do not underestimate them - they possess martial strength more than ten times greater than my own, and the instinctive knowledge to wield it effectively. You may consider them giant brutes, but I would consider them masters of combat - the guardians of the secret of hellfire.""

""Hellfire? Would I be able to make any use of it?""

Sama'el sneered in much the same way a human would smile.

""As fuel, you mean,"" the demon clarified. ""Yes. Your flamethrower's effectiveness would be dramatically increased if you were to immolate the secret charcoal - all who lack an immunity to fire would be burned ceaselessly by the destructive power of hellfire. It would truly be a formidable weapon against any foes who do not have the demon blood.""

Brian stopped to consider his reluctant follower's explanation.

""You mean it wouldn't work on, say, you?""

""Not on me,"" Sama'el answered, ""nor on the Great Ones. If you wish to do battle with them, fire will not help you. You will need a more conventional weapon... as well as my assistance, of course.""

The human looked meekly at his flamethrower, wishing, for once, that it were a slashing weapon.

""Not to worry,"" the demon continued. ""If it's a blade you seek, I think I know just where to look.""",Chironspiracy

Eyes closed, I straightened out on the cold floor of my apartment and popped my back. Sleeping on the floor always sucked, but after playing Dark Souls III for a week straight I'd barely been able to see. Since I stopped to sleep it was probably a good time to get some food, I needed the energy to start NG+11. With a sigh I opened my eyes, staring at the ceiling. At least that was the plan, there wasn't a ceiling to stare at.

Jumping up, I frantically looked around. I was laying on a ledge of unnaturally smooth stone, recessed into the wall of a cliff. A small fire, looking exactly like the Bonfires in Dark Souls I noticed, burned in a corner. A small stairway stuck out near the fire. A quick glance over the edge showed hundreds of caves and thousands of small stairways crisscrossing the face of the cliff. Taking a deep breath, I stepped on the stairs and began carefully walking towards the nearest cave. I needed to know where the hell I was.

&amp;nbsp;

The first person I came across was a vegetable. He didn't respond to anything I did, didn't even flinch when I got fed up enough to slap him. I don't know what got to him, but he looks fine. It freaked me out a little, I do not want to end up like that.

The second person was a gold mine, even if I didn't know it at the time. He told me that we were in hell, that we were sentenced to fight demons and monsters for all eternity and that when eventually die we will wake up next to the last bonfire we slept by. I was skeptical, to say the least. He was describing Hell as Dark Souls, a world I had always wanted to enter. It was almost comical, and I was sure he was either crazy or on the side of whoever kidnapped me and was trying to feed me misinformation. Either way, I wrote him off.

The third person I met kicked me off the edge of his cave as soon as I tried to enter. I could see the hate on his face, before it changed to shock. As I fell he yelled at me to come find him when I woke up. Some small part of me wondered what the heck he meant, the rest of me was screaming as the ground rushed up to meet me though, so I didn't really notice.

&amp;nbsp;

I woke up to the sound of a bonfire. Breathing heavily I sat up and looked around, finding the exact same cave I woke up in an hour ago. As my heart slowed to a more normal rhythm, I could barely contain my excitement. I was in Dark Souls! Or at least I was in something close enough that there wasn't any appreciable difference, either way it was awesome!

Standing up I walked over to the stairs, I remembered the path to the old man. I'd have to sit down and actually listen this time.

&amp;nbsp;

The old guy proved more then willing to talk, now that I believed him he actually went into far more detail then he had previously. About two hours of learning and a short walk later, I stood just up the stairs the cave where I had been killed. Yelled, ""Oi! Don't kick me this time around!"" I walked in, immediately jumping to the left so if he kicked me still I wouldn't fall of the cliff.

Relaxing slightly, the man leaned up against the wall of the cave. Looking me over he said, ""So, you're new.""

Rolling my eyes I replied, ""No shit Sherlock. How long have you been here?""

""Long enough. This is the first time I've seen someone so calm after their first death though, I'm surprised.""

""I play Dark Souls""

""You what?""

""It's a video game sort of like this, you get used to dying""

""Dying in real life is a bit different then dying in a game to most people.""

""Casuals"" I said, dismissively waving a hand.

With a feral grin he leaned towards me and said, ""well if you're so suited to this life, lets see how you like The Field. Follow me.""

Sighing heavily, I followed. If this was a movie, I was about to go on a training montage.

&amp;nbsp;

It had been barely a month since I first met John, and already I'm a bit better then him, at least while fighting monsters. It may have been due to the world; if I couldn't keep up I died, even though I always woke up it still hurt like hell. Personally, I attribute it to the fact I love to fight. Actually living it only made it more fun, there was so much more you could do if the system wasn't limiting you to certain movesets.

So here I am, sitting on the corpse of an Ogre. I have my sword, taking from a demonic lieutenant, and my armor, made from the hide of some dragon looking thing. John is still fighting his Ogre, it won't last much longer though. Soon we'll be strong enough to start working up the chain of command, we may even get to the Devil himself. 

I couldn't care less though, I'm having the time of my life.",DarkeKnight93

I thought I was a good guy, that I'd be saved and wake up at the pearly gates after death. I didn't.

I'd been playing since Demon Souls and the perseverance it takes to play through those games (Bloodborne too) stains your soul. It doesn't leave. When I woke up it was hot and gloaming. The sky was slightly overcast, the sun was falling, the ground was cracked and seemed to be steaming.

The first demon I saw cut me in half. It didn't hurt half as badly as I thought it would as I bled out into the thirsty ground.

I sat still the next time, juts watching, and I saw the others. They were crying and dying, over and over.

At first, I grinned. Then I smiled. Then I laughed and laughed and laughed.

It seemed like hell froze. I guess they hadn't heard laughter in a long, long time. But this, this was my shit. This was Dark Souls in real life. This was something I understood.

I began my work.

Wooden armor, stone sword. It took me quite some time to craft those. It's annoying when you die every once in a while, but when you keep coming back it means your work keeps going.

The first demon I saw pointed at me and roared. I leveled my stone sword, the notched seemed to glint in the sunlight.

It swung. I rolled and hamstrung it. It crashed down and screamed as I stabbed it through the back, the point of my weapon piercing through the demon's chest. I let go and threw up my hands.

""You're pretty good at it from what I can see.""

""Fuck off. Just kill me already.""

""Aww, that's no fun. You're the only decent conversation I've had in a while, even if the challenge wasn't quite on par...""

""Why are you even doing this?""

""Man's gotta eat.""

""Gross... Is that pot moving behind you?""

""Wow... you really think that's gonna work?""

""I'm not playing you man, that pot is mov-""

The pot in question vanished with a puff of white smoke and a brilliant figure took its place. Glowing with golden energy, the new arrival reached out his hand and clenched a small talisman, causing it to release a wave of power equal to the wrath of God. The wave crashed into the man above me with a brutal snap and sent him flying through the air.

I stared up at the new figure, it's smile greeting my stupor with unashamed good-humor. There was happiness - an awareness of true belonging - in his eyes, and the sight it... it gave me hope. 

Slowly, he reached his hand down to me and I, in a moment of unwavering belief in this salvation, reached back.

He slapped my hand away and a chime rang in the distance. A pair of ludicrously large hammers appeared in his hands and he spun them above his head, before sending them crashing into my body. 

As my life was freed from my destroyed shell, the quite whisper of the figure followed me to my next 'chance.'

""Behold,"" Sama'el announced grimly. ""This is the Tomb of Judas Iscariot.""

""You mean the one from the Bible?"" Brian asked after a short pause.

The demon gagged a little. ""That's the one.""

The human looked down at his pyrokinetic weapon.

""I thought you said we were looking for a sword,"" he stated, confused.

""That is precisely right. Within this tomb lies a special blade - the only blade, in fact, that you could hope to cause lasting harm to a Great One with. We must retrieve the Greatsword of the Betrayer before we can continue on.""

Brian paused again.

""Religion's not my strong suit, but I don't recall Judas ever owning a greatsword.""

""He forged it himself after he arrived on the shores of the Acheron, almost exactly two millennia ago. The Vestibule Regiment was tasked with hunting him down and delivering him to Treachery, the Ninth Circle - before we could reach him, however, he'd used the blade to drive off the horrors pursuing him, and he disappeared. Some say he still wanders the domain of the Uncommitted. Others say he found his own way to the eternal torment that awaited him. There are even some who suspect he escaped Hell entirely, just like his former Mentor.""

The demon glared upward, his infernal visage showing a mix of contempt, pain, and awe, before returning to his exposition.

""The sword itself was nothing special,"" Sama'el continued, ""until an enigmatic cult of mortals reforged it. Legend says they melted down a certain thirty pieces of silver and coated the length of the blade with the resulting metal - between this legend and the blade's origin, it's little wonder why it's called the Greatsword of the Betrayer. It's a good thing this cult later built this tomb and interred the blade there; the Legions of Hell were too afraid to claim it.""

""Why's that?""

""Legend or not, the sharp part of the blade *is* lined with silver,"" the demon guard answered. ""While it may not be a holy weapon, it's the next worst thing. Demons like myself are particularly vulnerable to silver, and with a name like 'Betrayer', the likelihood of one demon using this blade against another is too great. It would be safest where it is, in that tomb - failing that, it may be of some use to you on your quest.""

""Some use?"" Brian stammered with awe. ""This is just what I need to defeat the final boss! Although... aren't you worried I might betray you with it?""

Sama'el chuckled.

""Assuming you could best me in combat - which you couldn't - it amuses me that you might consider destroying your only ally a tactical advantage of any kind.""

""Point taken,"" the gamer-at-heart said with a nod.

""Now then, we must be very cautious,"" Sama'el warned. ""There could be traps, or dangerous creatures scuttling about, or...""

-----

""Why didn't you just tell me all we had to do was walk in and grab it?"" Brian asked, brandishing his new weapon.

""I didn't know,"" Sama'el answered with a bored frown. ""That was almost disappointing. Still, the rest of our journey won't be so easy... with that said, how do you intend to carry two large weapons at once?""

""Holsters,"" the human said simply. Sure enough, he'd cobbled together a makeshift belt-loop holster for his flamethrower, while the Greatsword of the Betrayer rested within a sheath he carried on his back.

""And the weight of that doesn't bother you? Bear in mind, you'll want to be as mobile as possible if you run into any Great Ones - your agility will be one of the few advantages you could conceivably possess against them.""

""Don't worry about me. I'll figure it out as I go. I always do.""

Sama'el smirked.

"[WP] In a world where knowledge is power, libraries are sacred temples owned by the rich. An underground group fights to make all libraries public.",heap-o-sheep,"I was a mere child when the last stronghold of public knowledge on the continent - the grand Library of Congress - fell into the hands of the most powerful person in the world. 


My father, then a 28-year-old young man, was escorted off the property and unceremoniously dumped into the streets of Washington, D.C. He watched on in horror as the doors were barred shut with titanium chains and two heavily armed guards took up their posts on either side of the main entrance. 


He brought the news home to my mother, who then sobbed in front of me for the first time in my four-year-old life. I tried to console her the best way a pre-schooler knew how, but hugging her tightly around the leg wasn't enough. That day, the lives of all children in the Western world changed forever. That day, the pursuit of knowledge was outlawed in all 57 States of America. That day, my parents became the first members of a group now known as the Knowledge Hunters. I am their legacy.


When I was ten, a mere six years after it all happened, my father was imprisoned. The police had surveiled him for months, learning God-knows-what about my family and our habits. In that time, my father surreptitiously taught me how to read in the basement of our tiny urban home. 


Before the last bookstores had shut down years before I was born, he had amassed a large collection of literature. He had, in effect, his own personal library - a possession prohibited under the new Law. He started his own school that consisted of me, our neighbour's two kids, and the daughter of one of the families a few blocks over. When classes began, our ages ranged from five (that was me) to eleven (the neighbour's oldest child, a girl named Marcy). My father taught us to read, write, and formulate our own ideas and opinions about world events.


The surveillance started when a new child joined our group. His name was Jordan, and he was my age - nine-turning-ten. He was a very studious kid with glasses that fell down to the tip of his nose while he pored over the myriad books my father supplied for him to read. He took inhumanly fast notes when my father lectured about this world event and that historical time period. The kid was a sponge for all the knowledge that he soaked up. I think he appreciated the education far more than the rest of us did. 


At least, that's what I assumed. The night my father was arrested, there was a loud pounding on the door right in the middle of dinner time. I remember it clearly - it was a week after my birthday and we were celebrating it a bit late with my favourite meal of homemade pasta sauce and spaghetti. My father excused himself from the table and got up to answer the door. 

I couldn't see around the corner, but I'll never forget the gruff, brutish voice that asked my father if he was Thomas Ward (yes) and that if he indeed was, that they had a warrant for his arrest. A chair clattered to the ground as my mother sprang to her feet and rushed to my father's side. My father put his arm around her protectively (I was later told that these were big men, that they had big guns, and they were absolutely not to be messed with). He had the gall to ask, ""On what charges?"" 


That was the last time I saw my father. The charges that led to his arrest soon became apparent: a team of heavily armed policemen stormed through our house, much to my dismay, and kicked down the locked door that led to the basement. They clomped their way down the stairs. My mother ordered me to pack my clothes and my most important items and to wait for her in the front yard. Ten minutes later, the police shoved her out at gunpoint. Smoke poured out of the windows as my childhood home went up in flames. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Jordan speaking with one of the officers. He looked straight into my eyes and smiled.

----

Though the way in which I gained my skills had been outlawed, the fact remained that I was able to read better than almost anyone my age. This worked in my favour. When I was twelve, the Law decreed that all those turning 16 would undertake an aptitude test and then choose a position in their given industry. It sounded just like the plot of one of the dystopian novels my father had kept in his library. The structure was not quite as rigid, of course. One could choose between similar industries if they wound up being better suited for something else - standardized tests are far from perfect, after all - but in all, it was meant to keep unemployment rates at an absolute minimum. The system would be sufficient to support those who were unable to work due to disability, maternity leave, or other various exceptions. When I finally turned 16 and took my aptitude test - after a mere two years of government-sanctioned ""General Training,"" it was found that I would be best suited to being a recordskeeper. This turn of events in my otherwise tumultuous life (after my father was arrested, we lived with my aunt in her too-small apartment; it was a kindness, but for a child that young, it seemed to be purely hellish) proved to be a boon. 


I returned home with the printed results (most others received their information via data disc) and placed them on the kitchen table. ""Recordskeeper,"" I announced with no greeting or context. My mother, who stood at the counter with her back facing me, froze her movements. Her head lifted and she slowly turned to face me. The weariness that had plagued her features ever since my father's arrest seemed all at once to dissipate. ""Oh, honey,"" she breathed, and ran toward me to pull me into an embrace."" 


I knew my parents were dissenters from the Law from quite a young age. I was trained to be silent when asked about any Illegal activities my parents my be partaking in, and I was taught that the Law was not always right and to (quietly) make my own way in the world when I could. When I was thirteen, my mother and my aunt initiated me into the Knowledge Hunters. They were a group comprised of seven women and four men. With me, that made five. My father had been their leader, my mother, his second in command. They clandestinely met with these folks, who came from all walks of life, on Saturdays. Everyone brought a meal and they called it a potluck dinner. On the outside, it looked like a group of friends getting together for a good time. 


In time, the group had gotten too large. They split into two, but kept in touch via designated messengers whose position changed each month. They had a plan: make knowledge available to the world again. All they needed was somebody on the inside.

I didn't trust him, and wanted to tell him so. When Chase got an idea in his head, it was bound to be one I wasn't down for.

We crept around the corner under cover of night. On the side of the run-down brick shack was a concrete staircase descending into the ground, lit a dirty orange by the building's only light. Chase led the way down, with Adam and Mackenzie following. I trailed nervously behind.

He opened the door, revealing a basement larger than the shack above it. My heart skipped a beat at what I saw inside.

Beds. Dozens of them. Some had people in them, using them. I felt a knot in my stomach just seeing them here in front of me. In fact, I was kind of ashamed that I even knew what they were called. Was that bad? I couldn't get in trouble for knowing about beds, right?

I looked over the people inside. They were lying completely motionless like corpses, but they were still breathing. I felt like I was in a zombie movie, with these bodies stirring and making quiet grumbling noises to themselves. I had never seen anybody this far gone.

Chase elbowed me in the side. ""See, what'd I tell you? Awesome, right?""

I couldn't believe it. He was part of this culture? Didn't he know the risks? I could object, but he wouldn't listen. I just shook my head, slack-jawed.

Adam circled around to the other side of me. ""C'mon, Ryan. We walked all the way here; are you gonna try something new, or just puss out and run home?""

I remembered back in elementary school, when we all got those fear-mongering brochures about the dangers of going sub-conscious. They told us it would make our brains melt into rotten goo. I know better than that now, but they certainly nailed the peer pressure aspect of it.

Mackenzie spoke up. ""It's fun, Ryan. You see the craziest stuff. I once thought I was in some building that was like my house and school at the same time. And you can fly and stuff.""

Her too? Was I really the outlying point here? Chase maybe, but until a few minutes ago I'd have called that a stretch. Turns out I was the only one who hadn't been sneaking out and doing... this.

It sounded enticing, I could give them that much. Who wouldn't want to step out of reality, and see a world that couldn't exist? But I had heard the horror stories. First you set out to trip for a few minutes, and when you come back, eight hours or more have just disappeared. I'd heard it said that your first time could lose you almost a full day if you weren't prepared.

Finally I had something tangible to hold onto in my head. ""But how do I know I'll come down in time? I don't want to be in here until the sun comes up.""

Chase laughed. ""We have you covered. Check it out.""

He pulled out his phone, and set an appointment alarm for an hour from now.

""This is loud enough that it can bring you right back whenever you need it to.""

""Are you sure? I mean, I don't know, I've just heard that it doesn't work sometimes. Or, like I've heard that when you hear it, you can sober up long enough to turn it off and then drift away again. Does it really take hold that strongly?""

""We're all here together,"" Adam said. ""We know you're new to it, we'll keep an eye on you.""

Maybe it was that gesture of friendship, but I began to feel like they were wearing me down. These guys were good people. They were jerks sometimes, but we stuck together. I guess I could just try this once, and surely I'd be strong-willed enough or self-aware enough to fend off an addiction. I took a hesitant step toward the row of beds.

Chase clapped his hands. ""Woo, Ryan's in!""

The others bee-lined to a set of four adjacent beds. I laid down on the rightmost one. Mackenzie laid down in the one beside me, and pulled the blankets up to her shoulders. I noticed that my bed had those too, and followed suit. Hopefully I was doing this right.

Mackenzie looked over at me. ""Just remember, it's natural. Animals do this, people in other countries do this... if it wasn't for the stuff they put in our water, we'd *have* to do it, but they feed us this narrative about it being dangerous.""

I didn't buy that conspiracy stuff. Sure, other people and animals did this kind of thing, but what of it? Animals eat rotten berries and mushrooms too; we're just civilized enough to wean ourselves off this crutch. And I didn't want to think about the developing nations and their habits. I heard that parents would make their own children go sub-conscious when they did. The kids couldn't handle it, they were so prone to bad trips that they'd see their fears come to life as monsters. It was sick that somebody could do that to their own child.

But I was in no position to get on a soapbox now. ""Yeah, okay,"" I replied meekly.

Chase and Adam already had their eyes closed and were lying still. Mackenzie closed her eyes too. This was it, I guess. No turning back now.

I closed my eyes as well, and waited to feel myself drift away...",keeponliving

[WP] A bank is being robbed. A sperm bank,kim_jong_un4,This one's good.,Rivka333
[WP] A bank is being robbed. A sperm bank,kim_jong_un4,"The van was difficult to start. The key had to be turned softly, and slowly, while gently pushing the gas. If you turned it too hard, or pushed the gas all the way down, the van would emit a clicking electrical noise like sparks flying from a short circuited stun gun. And then the damn thing would need a jump. For this reason The Fergusons had decided to leave it running for the duration of the heist- as they had taken to calling it.
They had decided on disguises as well. It was crucial that they not be discovered. Beyond the basic criminal element of robbing a sperm bank, there was the additional embarrassment that Eli felt for basically admitting to the world that it was his sperm that was defective. The reason for the heist was made necessary because” his guys did not swim”. That is what the doctor had said, his way of breaking the news softly. The reason why Sheila could not get pregnant was because “his guys did not swim.”  If he could, Eli would wear the mask all the time.
The plan was simple. Get in. Get the goods, and get out. There were no security guards, but there would be cameras, and a possibly a dog. First Eli had to cut the lock on the gate with the bolt cutters. He had been practicing cutting locks for a week now, and had finally gotten his time down. Sheila would remain in the idling van, while Eli then took the crow bar to the back door. Likewise Eli had practiced opening a locked door with the burglary kit he had assembled.  Once inside he would find a sample, and escape to start a new life with Sheila, and hopefully soon a new son or daughter.
But the plan fell apart from the beginning. Sheila had chosen a rubber bunny mask, because it was cute, and because it covered Eli’s entire head. He had never tried it on before, and now was regretting this obvious oversight on his part. The mask was tight and ill fitting. He could barely see out of the eye holes, and the ears flopped about like two limp sausages on his head. As soon as the Fergusons approached the gate, they became acutely aware of the two Rottweiler attack dogs guarding the entrance. The second Eli exited the van in his bunny mask the two enormous dogs began to leap and bark like maniacs. Eli had his bolt cutters in hand, but if he cut the lock and opened the sliding chain link fence, the dogs would rip him to pieces. They were all the more agitated to see a rabbit, and began to froth and foam with excitement and blood lust. 
Eventually Eli had to return to the van, and cut the lock while hanging out of the window. Eli Ferguson then opened the gate slightly and the couple drove off, the two guard dogs nipping at the tires. They drove for three miles before they lost the two rottie’s in the dust. They then circled back to the ware house. Eli was feeling optimistic. This feeling did not last long. He bent his crow bar trying to open a reinforced   security door. But a quick scan revealed a window high up on the wall. Sheila positioned the van so Eli could climb up the back and gain access to window. He smashed the glass and began to squirm through the tiny opening. 
It was then that the alarms began to sound. Sheila’s first instinct was to panic. She dropped the van in gear and hit the accelerator. Eli was still half in, and half out of the window. Without the van for support he was trapped fifteen feet in the air. His feet kicked wildly, but did nothing to free himself, or gain entrance to the warehouse. She slammed on the brakes, and the van stalled out. She turned the key wildly, and the van began to vibrate and shriek. The sound of electricity arching through the steering column was clearly audible. There was a puff of blue smoke and the van issued forth its last gasp. Sheila exited the vehicle, and saw her husband exactly where she had left him. The alarms were blaring loudly when the two guard dogs returned, slightly out of breath, but still frothing and barking wildly. She had locked the keys in the van. She climbed on top of the now defunct vehicle, to escape the dogs, and wait for the police to arrive. Sheila Ferguson began to cry, and then laugh, and then cry again.

[WP] A bank is being robbed. A sperm bank,kim_jong_un4,"Another concussive blast shook the reinforced walls, shaking the steel bolts and rafters above her head. Dust motes from before the Barren Years floating slowly down to the floor like so many snowflakes.
 
*It could have been nuclear winter, it could have been the blinding blizzards of the second ice age, but this is what we get.* Becca thought to herself, inching from cover to peek out the barred window. 

“W-what are they doing?” Stuttered Rob, all shakes and jitters except for his eyes, which had been firmly glued to her assault rifle from the moment she pulled it off of the rack.

“Really, Rob? They’ve been at this for a while now, you know what they’re doing.”

She didn’t bother describing to him the scene outside. Men hung like monkeys off of a gigantic structure composed of rusty metal and wood so poorly assembled she almost couldn’t identify the shape. The men that weren’t hanging off of the structure brandishing weapons were busy drawing the giant phallic battering ram back for another blow. The men rushed forward as one, chains and piercings rattling and snake tattoos on their arms bulging from the effort. The ram hit the gate and Becca heard screeching as the metal bowed under the force. The gate wouldn’t last much longer.

                                          ----------------

“Good hit! Good hit!” yelled Brendan, encouraging the lowly gang initiates swinging the ram. An impressive thing she was. Built by the most competent carpenters and metal workers the Python Gang had to offer.

“Pull back! Heave! Ho!” 

He swung his club wildly in his left hand, clinging onto the frame of the ram with the right. There was no strategic purpose to hanging off of the siege weapon, but it just made you feel *powerful* you know? Like being a part of it. He drew in a breath and closed his eyes, knowing that as soon as they cracked this nut it would be like it was before the Barren Years, before years of pollution and chemical exposure mutated the genetics of billions of males, making them sterile. They could be hopeful again, they could be free again, they could be men ag-

A violent shudder knocked him out of his reverie, and he snapped his head around to see that one of the two spherical weights tucked under the ram to give it more force had fallen off, crushing one of the initiates and throwing the whole thing off balance.

“Fix it! Fix it!” Brendan shrieked, jumping off the frame to help center the remaining weight.

                                         ----------------

Becca shuffled back to cover and sat down next to Rob with a loud sigh.

“Their ram broke, but it won’t be long now before they’re through. You remember where to go?”

“Through the hatch in the back and through the tunnels until they dump me out to the river, then follow that north to Hare City to find Dr. Rana. I’m to give her this.” 

Rob tapped the CryoVial™ held by a thong around his neck, the white liquid inside catching the light from the window through which Becca could hear cheering, they fixed the ram. Becca looked back at him and nodded her approval.

“I don’t think help is coming Rob, you need to leave now. Tell Dr. Rana there’s nothing salvageable here, I’ve contaminated all of the other specimens. Tell her I died doing what I loved, putting bullets into idiots.”

“Why not come with me? Why stay here?”

Becca shrugged. 

“It’s either I deal with them here of they continue marauding through the countryside, now’s the best chance I'll have to deal with them.”

Rob wiped a tear from his eye and gave Becca a sniffling embrace. Nothing else was said as he retreated to the back. Becca heard the hydraulics as the hatch opened, and she set up behind the counter, and waited.

                                        ----------------

“One more and we’re in!” Screamed Brendan, giddy with anticipation. 
The great ram was pulled back once more, and thrust forward into the breach, slamming the doors open. Battle cries full of blood lust and confidence were soon shattered into squeals of fear, broken by the thunderclaps of Becca’s rifle. Gang members fell to the left and right of him as Brendan dodged around the twisted metal hanging off enormous hinges on the wall and scattered over the ground, gaining entry into the building.

A small secretary’s desk sat in the middle of the large foyer, with Becca shielding herself from the makeshift spears and occasional rock thrown her way. Only Brendan and seven others were left from the initial charge, her bullets claiming more than half of the Python Gang. They crept forward, taking cover where they could behind pillars and plastic shrubs. 

“You know what we want!” yelled Brendan. “Just lay down your gun and you’ll live!”

“I know what you’ll get!” screamed Becca, cutting down another Python hiding behind a plastic fern.

“Stubborn bitch.” Muttered Brendan.

By the time her gun clattered empty to the floor, there were four Pythons with clubs and Becca with her knife. She rose up from behind the desk, right shoulder sore from a well-aimed rock. Brendan approached cautiously, trying to flank her, another Python charged her and was unceremoniously cut down, an expression of shock on his face as blood spilled from his neatly severed carotid artery. The last three Pythons herded her away from cover and surrounded her. 

Becca ducked under swings of clubs, low kicks and backed up from the occasional head-butt, managing to hamstring one of the Pythons in exchange for a glancing blow on her right shoulder. She yelped as her knife was knocked free and clattered across the blood-stained tile, but kept enough wits about her to roll away from the next club aimed at her head. The hamstringed Python caught the hem of her pant leg as she stood up, knocking her off balance as the other Python grabbed her from behind in a bear hug and squeezed the breath out of her. Becca snarled and kicked but was no match for the weight of the larger man. He wrapped an arm around her neck and pulled up. Becca’s face went from red, to purple, to blue, and then she was still. 

Brendan and the other Python rushed into the back room and shouldered open the door. The splintering board slammed into the wall as they admired their prize. Wire metal shelves full of semen in their CryoBoxes™. 

“It’s enough for an army!” said the Python. “Enough for a vast a-“

Brendan’s club crunched into the base of his skull, silencing any further proclamations.

“It’s enough for a world” corrected Brendan. “A world ruled by a man so rich and powerful, that no one will call him impotent again.”

[WP] A bank is being robbed. A sperm bank,kim_jong_un4,"I paced back and forth right outside the two-story stone building. The 30mm pressed up against my abdomen under my jeans. My heartrate was exceedingly high and my breathing was in need of a paper sack. My first robbery. I should say my first solo robbery. Gas station jobs with friends emptying register tills and snagging cigarettes - child's play for what I was about to do. But I had to think about the reward. I wouldn't have to do another job for a year if I could get through this. Forcing myself to calm down I took a deep breath. 

The sidewalks were starting to populate with the morning busybodies. Entrenched in their phones. Minds on a one-way track. Nobody gave me a second glance, even with my all-black attire and backpack on, they couldn't of cared less. I was a tree in the middle of the sidewalk - an obstacle they moved to avoid. I didn't mind, though, not today.

I waited anxiously outside the glass door of the place. There was a single patron inside. I wasn't expecting anybody in there so early. He was here in line as I exited my taxi. He saw me approaching the building and greeted me excitedly. ""First time?!""

""What?"" He caught me off guard. 

He asked again, ""Is it your first time donating sperm?""

""Oh. Yeah, it is. First time.""

""I have been saving up for 2 weeks! They said if I can fill up two servings I can get paid double. My personal record is one and a half, but I think I can do two. I could really use the money between you and me.""

I really didn't need to hear this guy's story right now. It was taking me out of the moment.

He continued, ""God, I'm shaking. I need to blow this load now. All I've eaten is pasta, pasta, pasta for the past week.""

""Pasta?"" I asked.

""Oh, I forgot you're new. Yeah starchy foods, a.k.a. pasta, gives you stronger loads. It's your best chance to fill up more than one serving.""

""Good to know.""

""Oh yeah! My house is basically an Italian restaurant at this point. Lasagna over here, chicken alfredo over there, fettuccine in the corner. I'm telling you I've gone through countless amounts of olive oil and marinara bottles.""

""Wow. I can't even imagine.""

""No! There's no way you could. My neighbors was verbally concerned for me when my order of industrial sized Barilla pasta boxes got delivered. They wondering what the hell I was doing in my apartment. I ignored them of course. I had a goal in mind and by George I was going to achieve it.""

I had just about had enough of this guy when the front desk attendant unlocked and opened the front door. His attention shifted off me and to her. Thank God. She politely waved at him and motioned for him to come inside, ""Good morning, Jerry.""

""Morning, Beth!"" He turned back to me. ""Wish me luck!""

I shot him two thumbs up. 

""Thanks!"" He ran up the stairs so fast he nearly tripped.

What was taking him so long? I didn't want him in there when I robbed the place. The fewer the people, the less chance of trouble. The bank had been opened now for thirty minutes. If I waited any longer I would be running into more patrons. 

Screw it. I couldn't wait any longer. I pulled down my ski mask and began up the stone stairs. Placing my hand on the cold steel handle I glanced around me as a final caution. Nobody was coming up and the busybodies were few and far between by now. The door opened. 

But not by me. It was that damn Jerry. Looking exhausted. A pin stuck to the front of his shirt. It read '5-Serving Club'. I lifted up my mask momentarily - didn't want him to signal the authorities. He instantly recognized me. ""Still outside? It's freezing.""

""I'm going in now,"" I replied.

He reached into his back pocket and retrieved his wallet. He pulled out a few hundred dollars. ""This is what pasta can get you,"" he smiled and waved the money at his face like a fan cooling himself off. ""The nurse couldn't believe her eyes. She said it was like hitting the jackpot at the casino - it just kept coming.""

The cogs were turning in my head with veracity. I didn't have to rob this place. I could make just as much money donating sperm like this guy, maybe more. It was far safer, a lot more fun, and much less terrifying.

I placed my arm over Jerry's shoulder. ""Name's Doug. So, pasta, you say?""

Finger and Sammy double checked their equipment and the freezer while Itchy, the driver, pulled the van up in front of Hollywood Genomes. As soon as Itchy threw in in park Jimmy and the two trigger men pulled down their masks and filed out guns drawn.

The second the entered the door Sammy spotted the guard and clubbed him hard with the butt of his rifle.  Finger wasted no time using the gold plated finger that gave him his name to spray several rounds into the ceiling.  Jimmy made sure the civilians were keeping their faces on the floor while the other two tied them up along with the unconscious guard.  They made it into the cold storage room in under 3 minutes without incident.  However, that's when things went south in a hurry.  Sammy knocked over some random jerkoff's fresh specimen.  Finger slipped in it.  He mowed down Jimmy and clipped Sammy on the way down breaking his own neck on a shelf.  

When Bits relayed the shit show to Itchy he peeled out without a moments hesitation. By the time Sammy dragged himself to the exit the police already had the place surrounded.  He wasn't going back to jail, especially not over something as embarrassing as this, as was killed in the resulting gun fight.

[WP] It is 1490 and large well armed ships are off the coast of Spain. The invasion of Europe by the combined forces of the Apache Union and Iroquois Confederation has begun.,mystictheist,"There was panic in the small coastal town of Nemina. The queen's troops had cordoned off the civilians and a small regiment had taken up position in the town. The rest of Her Majesty’s army would take a while to reach here from the land frontiers. Help had been requested from King Charles of France and King Ferdinand of the Holy Roman Empire whose troops were on their way.

But Abilio wasn't sure if even those armies combined could save them. From the beach he gazed at the horizon dotted with strange warships. These were different from their sailboats, or even the Chinese Junks. They were long, narrow and huge. Abilio estimated that each one should carry about five hundred warriors each, perhaps even more.

Three burly men got off a small rowboat wearing large fearsome hats and intimidating war paint. Abilio gulped as he moved towards them. He was a rank-bureaucrat in her majesty’s service, a career diplomat with no ambition other than to retire with full patronage. He wondered if these menacing foreigners had heard about not shooting the messenger. 

Abilio knelt and gave a polite greeting. They said something intelligible. The man standing in the middle glanced at one of the men behind him, who brought forth the most perfectly caste wrought iron sphere. The next time they spoke, it was in high Spanish of her majesty’s best poets.

""This is not India?""

Abilio paused to find his breath.

""No, Sir. An honest mistake, I'm sure."" He tried to give a chuckle.

""Do you grow spices in this land?""

""No. We traded it for gold with the Arabs who trade it in return with the Indians. But  then the Turks captured Constantinople and we might have to fare the vast turbulent oceans to get to India ourselves.""

""And this fine cloth you’re wearing- where does this come from?""

""Ah, this is silk from the far off land of Chin. They call it the middle kingdom. It's right next to India, separated by a vast impenetrable mountain.""

""So what's here in this continent? My men tell me there's little land left. You're already full with people and strange disease that my messengers keep dying from”. 

“Umm, we have iron, wine, wax and wool. But unfortunately, the Indians and Chinese don't need much of that, and we ended up emptying our coffers of gold and precious metals for their cotton, spice and silk.”

The men looked confused.
“I know. We need to do something about that.. Some have suggested setting up trading posts and trying to establish our political enclaves in those lands. But for that we need to find sea routes.""

“What a silly idea. You will go to war and take their land just for trade? Can’t you just trade to trade?”

The two men laughed with their leader.

""So the people from India and the people of Chin wouldn't trade in spices and silk for fur and leather?""

""Highly unlikely, Sir. Its pretty warm down there. And they have enough cattle.""

“Not even the leather from a great bison?”

“I don’t think so. I’ve heard there are bisons there too.”

The leader shook his head in disappointment. The minions followed.

""So where do you come from?"" Abilio asked cautiously.

""From the West.""

""Wait - you mean you won't reach India if you go straight west from here?""

“No, you will reach our home. We are looking for India ourselves.. Maybe we will call you white Indian.”

The minions chuckled. Abilio tried to ignore them, not getting the joke.

“And what do you produce in this land of yours, Good Sir?""

""Its a land of abundance. It isn't as crowded as here, and there are very few diseases. The pastures roll endlessly, the rivers run throughout the year and the land is very fertile. Enough game to live a life of self-sufficiency. We are one with nature."" The leader said proudly.

""Oh.. very interesting.""

""Well, we'll get going. It was nice chatting. We might’ve traded with you but it doesn’t seem we have anything that either of us could need. See ya!""

As the rowboat went off the gigantic fleet turned around and disappeared quickly into the blue waters. 

The soldiers and civilians heaved a sigh of relief. 

But Abilio was pacing around frantically in his room.

""You called for me?""

""Yes, how're you doing, Chris?""

""Just preparing for a voyage. We will go South, keep hugging the coastline of the Africas to avoid getting lost into the warm waters of the Atlantic. When we reach the farthest point South of the peninsula, we will turn North East and reach the Coromandel Coast.""

""Chris, what if I told you of the opportunity of a lifetime. Tell the Queen that you're setting sail for the west to discover India. You won't succeed in this mission, but you’ll find something much better.""

""West? That’s the open sea! There is no coastline we can keep close to for safety. And if I don’t find India then why should I take such a dangerous journey?""

""Because it is a land of abundance. It isn't as crowded as here, and there are very few diseases. The pastures roll endlessly, the rivers run throughout the year and the land is very fertile. Enough game to live a life of self-sufficiency. And much more we know nothing of.""

Chris looked at Abilio with skepticism.

""Trust me, it's way richer than India and China combined."" Abilio was stretching it here, but he had to try.

""What about this Southern journey? Somebody has to chart that route since we can’t travel through Constantinople anymore.""

""Don't worry. I'll arrange for my buddy Vasco da Gama to do that for you.. he's a lazy chap though, and it may take a few years of convincing.""

Chris Columbus sighed.

""Alright, I’ll do it. I hope it'll be as good as you say. Count this one as a favour."" He said and departed to prepare for his new voyage.

[WP] It is 1490 and large well armed ships are off the coast of Spain. The invasion of Europe by the combined forces of the Apache Union and Iroquois Confederation has begun.,mystictheist,"The plague hit Paris like a wave, beginning in the western portion and spreading through the streets; in days half the city was dead. News of the ships in Normandy had only just reached the Duke Laurent when he learned that war was breaking out across the north. Strange men with copper skin and no armor, riding wolves the size of horses, bred for battle. They had no firearms, but their bows were powerful and their aim deadly. Even in the foreign woods they navigated swiftly and quietly. 
Although to the French they looked like savages, within days they took Paris, marching over the corpses of the plague ridden dead and into the capital. The survivors trembled at the sight of the massive wolves, striding calmly through the streets with men riding them.

Duke Laurent had learned not a day before that the king was dead of plague. And the prince, and most other nobles. He was the defacto leader of the French, and although line of communication were cut off, he knew similar forces had landed in Spain and Portugal. Those states, too, were decimated by plague, leaving them unable to fight back even with greater technology. An Apache wolf-steed could take six bullets and still chase down a horse and its rider. 

The Duke had no choice but to allow the invaders through the gate of the palace. He welcomed their leader, a Chieftain named Singing Storm, in the throne room, where he sat.

The chieftain was not a large man, but his eyes were dark and sharp and his warpaint made the Duke uneasy: it was painted like a wolf.

[WP] Tell the saddest story your heart can bear.,neonnightowl,"He killed his mother and his father would never love him.

Nothing anyone ever said would change the fact that she died when he was born. If he had been a pound lighter or a month earlier or had just withered in the womb, she would have been making her famous strawberry jam for decades to come. Folks said a child born after their father died could cure fevers. They never said anything at all about a child born after their mother died, and they said as little possible *to* them. 

His father might have loved him, once his grief had faded to a dull roar, but for the way he spoke and acted. He didn't sound like a girl; no girls in these parts sounded like that. But he didn't sound like a boy, either.

He pitched the same amount of hay. He chopped the same amount of wood. He could shoot a partridge as well as any and gut a fish cleaner than most. But even with a blade in his hand his wrist was a little too loose.

He got used to being hit with rocks. He got used to coming home to a silent house where he and his father lived apart. 

When he was fourteen he had gutted and sold enough fish for a train ticket and had been hit by more than enough rocks to want one. He hitchhiked to the train station in the next town over. Bad things happened to him before he got there, as they sometimes do to young boys who travel alone.

He was lucky in the city. Unbelievably lucky. He found a job in an office instead of somewhere with less light. A law office. And when his employer found him reading one of the books he was meant to be sorting after hours in those lights, he noticed. His employer talked a certain way, too. And so did his business partner. And many of their friends. Even their wives talked a certain way.

When he was forty-five, he was his own employer. He had someone to sort books for him and someone to chop his wood and a golden watch and a beautiful wife who he did the crossword with most mornings and slept down the hall. He was paid by the hour to use his funny voice in court, although he had learned to make it a little less funny in front of others. He had not sounded rural in decades, not even in private.

He would come home to his beautiful avenue lit by electric streetlamps where not a brick was out of place. His towering greystone was just a little taller than his neighbours thanks to its fine wrought iron weathervane, which he never used as the man on his radio told him the weather each day and besides that he worked inside.

He had dinner, which he paid someone to cook, with his wife and her friend and his husband and they were all neighbours which they all enjoyed for they were all fine friends. They sipped French brandy and Italian wine and talked about the opera. And then when it was getting late and there were board meetings and trial preparations in the morning, they all went upstairs. He sometimes shared a bed with his wife's friend's husband, when they could, for they were fine friends.

And as he lay on his goose down mattress and his cotton sheets in his beautiful home amidst the laurels of his work,  he would sometimes sob uncontrollably. Every moment of the day he hated himself and everything he was. 

He would never be happy, because he had killed his mother and his father would never love him.

His wife's friend's husband never minded the crying, because his story started and ended more or less the same.

[WP] Tell the saddest story your heart can bear.,neonnightowl,"""What do you think?"" Laurie stepped into the apartment, carrying the baby and watching as her three other children bounded in, excited to have a home of their own again. It had been a long time living in shelters and they would still have to share a room, but now it wouldn’t be with strangers.


“It’s awesome Mom!” Janey hugged Laurie around her waist. Laurie looked down at her oldest, still only 10 years old and knew that she’d already seen far more than any kid ever should. She only hoped that now Janey would have a chance at something normal. No more fear and trying to keep her brothers and sisters from seeing their dad come home drunk, come home angry and beat their mother down.


It had taken years before Laurie had the courage to leave, the breaking point had come a year ago when Bill came home and had seen Janey playing dress-up with lipstick and high heels. When Laurie could convince herself that it was just a drinking problem and if she could just do things right it would be okay, because at least he never hurt the kids. But that day, he’d called Janey a little slut and slapped her, leaving a red palm print screaming on her cheek. Laurie had rushed him, fighting back, but she still wound up in the hospital that night. This time when the cops asked her the questions, she told the truth.


Life took on a surreal quality where the simple things felt amazing. Going to work and earning her own money, something Bill hadn’t let her do were sources of pride. Making the kids supper and not worrying about what time it was on the table, making them junk food, letting James splash his food on the highchair tray and loving the giggles that came from everyone. Making a chocolate cake for Jules to celebrate her first day in kindergarten – Bill hadn’t allowed dessert. Can’t have a fat wife and kids he would say and then laugh as though he had said something funny. Jaden sharing his stories, no longer scared to speak up. Laurie had never known how funny he was. The way he noticed people and the little things that made them tick.


Laurie made a few friends from work and one night agreed to go out for drinks. Mrs. Hinks from across the hall agreed to watch the kids that evening. She had a great time, enjoying a few hours laughing and sharing stories about the clients that came through the office.


But as the taxi turned the corner she saw the flashing red lights and the red glow that came from behind the apartment building that faced the street. She jumped out of the cab, with the driver shouting behind her for not paying. She ran to the trucks and a police officer tried to push her back.


“MY KIDS ARE IN THERE!” She screamed. The building, her building was engulfed in flames. Laurie pushed against him and ran past, towards the searing heat, past the fire fighters with their hoses, towards the door with flames reaching out for her, but she was tackled to the ground.


“MY KIDS ARE IN THERE!” She wailed.


“I’m so, so, sorry, but you can’t help them. No one came out. No one’s making it out.”

Take the example of two young lovers, not Romeo and Juliet. They were fools and children playing at love. Love is not words, not to these two. 

Meeting in youth the two grew up with one another, they laughed, they played and were children. As they grew they both started to realize that something was different. At first they both don't know what it is, or why they suddenly feel different when the other is near. 

The boy realizes it first, obsessed with the large tomes for his age, and absorbed in the romantics of knights saving a princess, or dashing space pirate swooping in on beams of light he has an inkling, one that he knows not how to deal with.

The girl realized it as she looks at the boy, trying to figure out why he is suddenly so reserved, so much less rambunctious then he was a year ago. Why does he no longer treat her like he did? At the same time she starts to look at the dresses her friends are wearing, maybe he will pay attention if she wears one? 

So the time old dance continues, both distance themselves from the other, neither knows what is going on. The realization to them both begins to dawn as they grow older. They see the other around them staring to emulate what other have seen, what has propagated and become cultural. 

Cheap and shallow relationships, vindictive and cruel breakups, meaningless declarations of the missing word.The two think that if that is what the word is, if that is what everyone looks for in life, perhaps they are different? That is not what they want. 

The boy now a young man has left his books behind, bitter he looks at the world through cynical eyes. The antics of his peers continue, meaningless relationships and foolish choices. Now with lasting consequences most of his peers have reluctantly pared off, doomed only to be a statistic in the modern world he tells himself. After all, it is only a fairy tail, only a meaningless word. 

The girl now a young woman looks at the fake veneer, the fake mask she had always been told to wear. She looks at what it was that she was supposed to be, what many of the others around her have become obsessed with maintaining. So obsessed with the mask that many of them are no longer any more substantial than a frame to prop it up. 

The two begin to fade, faster than the other around them. 

Desperate, and mad at the world the boy musters what little courage he has left, bringing forth the small segment of him that once believed in the knights and dragons and goes to her. The girl, sick of the mask and wanting nothing more than to return to what was real goes to him. 

Neither can say the word, to them it has been tainted. 

They stare at one another. 

Each believing the other is just as shallow as the others around them. 

They no longer believe it exists. 

So they turn away from one another. 

Burned out, they fade away. They comply, they fall into the pattern, they say it to someone else only mimicking the words. The spirit behind what it once meant now dead. 

""I love you."" 

Those who can love, those who truly understand what it means are doomed to almost never find it. So they fade, broken by the world.

[WP] Tell the saddest story your heart can bear.,neonnightowl,"It taunted him from across the room. The shining screen danced on repeat, showing his work to him, time after heart breaking time. Empty bottles and fast food wrappers, a biology textbook that had never been opened. He wanted nothing more than to finish his vision, to take the final step toward the end of another long project. It did not matter to him if anyone ever saw it, only that it was there to be seen.

The project lay dormant, for month after month, taunting him each time he opened it to work. First came the phone's ring, his girlfriend was weeping hysterically. ""They took him to the hospital."" she manages to say between gasping breaths. He left his passion to comfort her, knowing that it would always be there to finish later.

But, as always happens, time escaped him. He had a job, his studies, his girlfriend and his family, all of these things, his connections to his world, took the forefront. He stopped his work, stopped his dreaming, and focused on building the life that he thought he was destined to escape.

Life slowed once again, and the dreams returned with such vigor as to rouse him from his pedantic existence. Work was completed, the project advanced, but the end eluded him. With every step forward, he doubted himself more. ""Who am I to finish such a thing?"" he thought. ""What talent do I possess to attempt such a project?"" he mused, but he was not deterred, on he went.

The phone rang, ""She is very sick."" his mother said. His childhood friend, his dog, was dying. This dog was his childhood, it had grown with him, loved him, and, when life had become hard, been abandoned by him. He sat in his car, his work had prevented him from being there to say goodbye, and cried. ""I'm sorry."" he said, between ragged sobs. ""I... I... I..."" he said, the sobs overpowering his will to speak. He stayed there for some time, but, as always, the phone rang. His father, checking on him, ""Are you okay?"" the older man asked. ""I think so. I don't think it has hit me yet."" he said in reply. A long silence passed between the two. ""I'm sorry I wasn't there."" he said. ""I'm glad you weren't. Nobody should have to see that."" The silence returned and eventually the call ended.

Life went on, the project was not opened. Work and school were all consuming, the drive to finish what he had started, the promises he had made, devoured his being. Every few days his father would send him a picture from a better time, a puppy and a child. A young dog and a kid in football pads. A young man leaving his home, the dog watching, tail wagging, jaw agape. He wished it would stop. He wanted to forget that loss. Every few weeks he would find her crying, he would hold her, joking and consoling her until she smiled again, then she would be fine. She would tell stories of her grandfather, and he would tell stories about his dog. They suffered together, trying to heal the wounds left by the departure of their loved ones. The constants of their lives, the beings that would always be there, always love them no matter how they failed.

It was the stories, the experiences, the accomplishments that brought joy to what felt like an incomparable loss. That they were so lucky to have known and loved and lost such beautiful creatures, that was their greatest gift. All fell by the wayside in recounting their stories among one another.

He opened the project, assured of the final design. His script was short. ""A man is shown beauty and loses it, he tries to reclaim it, but cannot capture it. He finds another, and together, they create beauty of their own.""

She grows sicker every day. With every new treatment, she grows farther from who she was. He stays with her, by her side every day and night. His grief comes in stages, hers in vicious waves. There are days when she hates him and others where he hates her. They blame each other, fight each other, telling one another that they would be better off separate. Each night he caresses her as she sleeps, willing the sickness to enter him instead, to hurt him instead, but his will is not sufficient.

He opens the project again, ""Death is beautiful. I have seen it, the midnight shroud that murders malice. We are such beautiful, broken things."" He writes every night, the phone is left unanswered. Bills mount, life passes as the project marches onward to its solemn completion. It is done, almost a year to the day.

He sells one book, than twenty, than a library full, on and on, but he does not celebrate. His family calls, but he simply says ""I am doing well... I'll see you soon... I promise... love you...""

He reads his work again, but cannot bear to see each failure. He wants to re-write, republish, redo... but the writing is done, the pages are set. So he sits, a picture in his mind, of what might have been, of what should be, but never will, nor could. An empty man in a beautiful home surrounded by those that love him. A beautiful, broken thing.",Fred_the_Destroyer
[WP] Tell the saddest story your heart can bear.,neonnightowl,"Brothers and sisters, today we mourn the loss of a great mother. She was out with her children yesterday when a bearded man came walking by ever so suspiciously. He was even wearing the skin of another fallen brother around his neck. The man watched her children first, staring at them, surveying them while aiming a rifle wildly. Our sister decided he was a threat and would risk her life for theirs so she pounced on him. Unfortunately he was a fighter and struck back. At first he seemed to have a chance, but as we all know our girl, she regained the upper hand. At first he screamed in agony as he was losing then he went silent. Luckily she thought he was subdued and tended to the children. 

By the grace of god they were all fine, then the man stirred, for he was not yet done. As our sister attacked he pulled his gun and shot her. The fight went on until they tumbled down a hill. This is the moment God decided to take one of our own at the expense of letting this man live. Her now deceased body lay on top of him, one last effort of hers to pin him down and protect her kids. But alas, some of his men came and not only freed their comrade but mutilated our dear friends body, removing her claws as some token of his murder. Thankfully her children were saved by her effort and are here to forage and seek shelter with us before winter has set in. 

This man murdered one of our own and was even rumored to be given one of the highest honors their species has for murdering one of us. Apparently the prize for killing our sister-bear is an Oscar.",Jimmy_Pages

[WP] Trains with guns,planetfemdom,"""Trains you say?""

""I do say."" he said.

""With guns, I dare ask?"" she dared.

He looked at her from within a bubble of silence, ""Do you have any concerns?

""Does it have a big caboose?"" 

""Do I look like a joker?"" he said in all seriousness, ""Of course it does.""

And they were off. A warehouse boomed to life with the clatter and banging of cargo too important to even mention. Loudspeakers added to the cacophony, an orgy of vibrations pinging off every wall in a blood curdling manner unfit for human consumption. But it had to be. 

Superheated flame fused metal to metal and flesh to burn gel. Hammers soared through the air like iron eagles bombarding lakes of fatty fish. And somewhere someone had been crushed by a shipping container, but this went unnoticed. 

""You start off here!"" the man yelled at her; though the word 'man' had more thickness to it than his chest. He continued, ""Crew inside there, go now and wait, your train is ready to go!""

She rushed through the fields of grey, where the wildlife spun at a million rotations per minute and jaws clamped with force of miniature black holes. Having dodged the spillage of molten iron, which illuminated through her blond hair like a low gravity sunrise, she climbed the steps and rang the door bell. 

The door opened with the smooth grace of a two legged snake. A soft looking girl stood behind it, a weapon strapped to her back so large that she looked like it was carrying her around instead. 

""Close the door already!"" someone yelled from within but it was barely audible. 

The young girl gestured for the arrival to enter and immediately closed the door behind them. It had instantly become so quiet that the newbie thought her ears had popped. 

""I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing!"" she yelled. 

""Don't yell please."" a large bulbous man begged, ""I have severe tinnitus as it is and..."" 

""...yeah, and you have cluster headaches."" another larger man whose weight was carried by muscle rather than fat chimed in, ""Nobody said you had to get a career in ammunition.""

""Don't say your name."" he address the newcomer now, ""Last in, you are Veefaiv for the remainder of this trip.""

Veefaiv was perplexed for a moment. 

""Ziwun."" he addressed himself. A large tan gentleman donning a large brown curling mustache which could curl a woman, and was probably used as such. Barely containing his hairy chest was a bright colorful button up shirt with blooming flowers stenciled in a variety of colors around it. His khaki shorts and sandals were probably a second thought and simply there to allow him entrance into his favorite laundromats. 

""Waitu."" the obese man said, he wore a very well made designer bullet proof vest with a penguin stitched onto one of the infinite amount of pockets splattered across it. He held two handguns which in comparison to his body looked like water pistols. 

Veefaiv was extremely itchy to get Waitu and the young girl to switch weapons. 

""That's Exthri."" Waitu pointed out, ""She doesn't say much."" 

Exthri looked over to Veefaiv, observed the minutiae of her movements, looked into her soul, assessed her priorities, deciphered her past, unraveled her fears, analyzed her clothing, predicted her future, and promptly said nothing. 

""I'm Dubulyufor."" said the little rainbow colored-hair girl, ""But you might as well just call me Dubbie because I'm not going to wait for you to...""

The train began to rumble just as Dubbie went to go take her seat, her humongous sniper rifle screeching against the floor. Which explained the layers of duct tape which wrapped the stock. 

""No time to waste."" commanded Ziwun to which everyone began to assume their positions. Ziwun sat himself at a chair with a several dozen monitors floating before it and a very intricate keyboard and joystick jutting out from beneath them. The other three climbed a ladder which led to the roof of the caboose. She could hear stomping into the distance. A large mechanical gear could be heard turning through the waves of sound that now flooded through the open hatch. A chain link clink clink clink clunked its way to life and a steel door began to grind open. 

""We've already lost a good man out there."" Ziwun told Veefaiv, ""You'll stay atop the caboose where its safest and make sure we don't get lifted off the track. The Earth ain't fertile out there anymore so I don't want to see your blood trying to grow any weeds, okay?""

""Okay."" Veefaiv responded. She readied her carbine and made one final check of her self made ammunition dispensing backpack. She slapped a button on the top and a magazine popped out by her side just beneath her shoulder with a few pin ball flourishes to boot. She took the magazine and placed it into the carbine as the train made it through the final sets of doors. She began to climb the ladder as the final door opened and a beam of light momentarily blinded her along with the sound of sneaky beasts, damned hordes, and impossible creatures. 

It was the strangest of things, she'd never seen sunlight before.

[WP] The Knight finally confront the Demon Lord.... Only to find that she was more beautiful than the Princess.,riyan_gendut,"Exhausted from a long journey, Koji was extremely close to giving in. Although, if he rescued the princess and didn't die, he would be in for one hell of a reward. *Maybe, just maybe, I'll be going to bed with the princess in a couple nights. Sounds good to me.* With that thought, he pushed onward. Creeping up the steps towards the top of the tower took awhile, but eventually, he was almost there. Taking the last few steps with caution, the door to the princess's chamber came into view. Koji paused for a quick moment, then gently nudged the door open, setting foot inside.

Once inside, he noticed the shadow of the magnificent princess Brynn laying on a canopy bed that was clothed in teal and shrouded by a dark blue curtain. Beyond this, there was a window in the stone wall, showing the heart-stopping view of the twinkling stars against the menacing night sky. *Wow. The princess isn't living so bad here. Maybe, I should just leave.* Then, he thought again. *Well, I could leave, or I could score big with Brynn.* He tiptoed over to the princess's resting spot, carefully pushing the canopy aside to wake her up. Just as he did this, Koji heard a whooshing, gusty sound not far from where he was. *Ah, that could just be the wind. Or, at least, I really hope it is.* He almost caught a glimpse of Brynn's bright blonde hair and snow white skin that he had been waiting to see for days since embarking upon this journey when the whooshing sound was heard again. He stopped. Koji was frozen in time. He heard breathing behind his ear. ""Hattori,"" he gasped.

""Did you miss me?"" Hattori asked, sounding genuinely innocent. ""At all?""

""Not a bit,"" he stated, trying to convince himself more than her. He couldn't even see Hattori, the half-demon, half-human work of art. Just hearing her voice made his heart pound.

""Do you know who I miss?"" She got closer to him so that Koji could smell her sweet breath near him. The soft flesh of her body pushed against his back, although he couldn't feel it much through his armor. She was making her presence known.

""Why are you acting like this if I killed your demon husband?"" He shouted at her, turning around. ""You know damn well I'm not going to bed with you because you're lonely,"" he bellowed, although this contradicted his thoughts of Brynn earlier.

""Oh, I'm not lonely,"" she whispered, almost inaudibly. Koji rolled his eyes at her and smirked. ""Okay, well maybe I am. But, I was never in love with him."" This didn't seem to convince him of her cause at all.

""Then why marry-""

""Because I wanted power, you bumbling fool!"" she screamed, purple and red flames shooting from every inch of her body, almost setting every flammable object nearby on fire. She was levitating a couple inches off the ground at this point. Koji took this fleeting second to look Hattori up and down. He noticed in this short time that she wasn't wearing her usual white and red face paint and her hair was down. Instead, she was wearing a beautiful, pale silk kimono. Even when she was in full demon mode with yellow, glowing eyes, he still thought she looked stunning. *Screw you for being a sexy demon.* ""You'd have to be a complete and utter fool, after all this time, to not realize that!"" Looking behind her, Koji saw Brynn, awake and horrified. She was standing beside her bed in a pastel pink nightgown. She was terrified as to what was happening, but being a smart girl, she slunk away back into her bed and feigned sleep during Hattori's screaming rampage. Using his muscles, Koji grabbed her by the midsection and pulled her down, trying as hard as he could to stop her from levitating. Her power was stronger than his physical strength most of the time, but she was extremely drawn to his touch, so her demonic aura disappeared as soon as his rough hands touched her body. Finally, her feet touched the floor. He leaned in close, as if about to kiss her. He peered into her eyes with fascination and starving desire, touching his nose to hers. Just before their lips touched, he turned his head to the side.

""You are very beautiful, that could make any man an idiot,"" he said in a low, sultry whisper. ""But,"" he continued, ""what you have done here is absolutely hideous. It makes me want to absolutely destroy you."" Her eyes lit up like fireworks. She rushed to close the distance between the two of them. ""Not in that way.""

""Are you kidding me?"" she groaned, scowling and backing away. ""I just kidnapped her,"" gesturing Brynn, ""to get some action from some handsome knights like yourself."" She slapped herself on the forehead. ""Perhaps next time---"" Koji cut her off when he slammed her into the grey wall made of stone.

""The princess's life is more important than my desire for you."" After a long silence, he let go of her, unsure of what to do next. He didn't want to kill her... yet. He had to see her prance around in that kimono for a little while longer before that could happen. Without a moment's hesitation, Hattori reached into her kimono and pulled a sword straight out of her chest, then turned it and pointed it at him, poking his neck.

""Is it really?"" She walked further towards him, nudging the sword even further in his direction until his back was against the wall. She lowered her blade and caressed his face gently, feeling the prickliness of his stubble on her palm. ""You really are a stupid man."" She came closer just like before, so that their noses touched once again. His wide eyes looked straight into her, not faltering for a second. ""But damn, you are hot.""

""Would you just shut up about---ah, whatever. This is supposed to be dramatic."" He cleared his throat before continuing on. ""I'm not going to bed with you. *I'd rather die.*""

*""Your choice, my dear,""* was the last thing he heard before the blade stabbed all the way through his neck and his eyes shut tight before his whole body went numb. ""Goodnight, Koji.""

[WP] The Knight finally confront the Demon Lord.... Only to find that she was more beautiful than the Princess.,riyan_gendut,"Sir Melethor broke through the stout locks on the doors of the castle with one mighty blow from his warhammer. He charged through the howling demonic guards and sent them screaming back to hell with a few more well-placed swings. His shining armor seemed to emit its own light that penetrated the inky shadows of the Demon Lord's lair.

""Let me guess,"" a voice called from across the room. A curtain was brushed aside, and the Dark One herself, Queen Halfaith, appeared at the end of the hall. ""My darling stepdaughter has persuaded you to come here to avenge her honor? Tell me, sir knight, which tale did she weave for *you*?""

The knight tilted his helmet's visor up just a bit to get a better look at her. Sure, Lady Margaret hadn't been explicit about what her stepmother looked like, but it was kind of *implied*. She was supposed to be hundreds of years old, and warped and wrinkled by black magic. Instead, she looked.... well, a bit like an upgrade from her stepdaughter. Her revealing robes didn't leave much to the imagination, and Sir Melethor certainly wasn't complaining. ""Errr... my lady... you are not... ummm...""

She smirked. ""Not what you expected?"" His armor clanked as he nodded, and Queen Halfaith gave an exasperated sigh. She took a seat on a plush couch and gestured for the knight to join her. ""Let me guess: she told you that I was a shriveled old crone, and the source of all evil in the universe, right?""

""Well, not in so many words,"" he answered. He still held his stout shield and mighty warhammer, but they seemed... frivolous. If the Queen had been armed, he would have been able to pretty easily see the weapon through those robes. She was no threat. 

""Come, sit,"" she invited him. ""You're not the first gallant young man that she has twisted to her will with those stories of her."" She gestured across the wall, where a number of shields, stamped with a variety of noble crests and sigils, hung. ""Fortunately, the men are generally willing to listen to reason and hear my side of the story as well. If you do believe me, I ask only that you leave me your shield as an apology. A good knight makes his own decisions.""

*That was true*, he reasoned. Come to think of it, Lady Margaret really hadn't explained *why* her mother was considered evil. She just repeated what horrible things she had done: consorting with demons, burning villages, attempting to kill her own step-daughter countless times, etc. ""Very well,"" he answered firmly. ""Tell me your side, then, and I shall determine whether you will live."" 

She smiled. ""I thank you for your chivalry, Sir...""

""Melethor,"" he answered with a clunky bow. ""Of Galbraith."" 

""Thank you, Sir Melethor. Tell me, in this one did she tell you that I was part dragon? Or was it that I poisoned her father? Or did she try to claim that I somehow caused those brigands to kill her birth mother?""

""The second one,"" Sir Melethor answered, his voice reduced to a low growl. Lady Margaret had been so convincing too, with those tears in her eyes! How could he have been such a fool?

""Ah yes,"" the queen answered. ""That is one of her favorites. Poor Harold wasn't poisoned; he just fell ill and died before Lady Margaret could return home. She always resented me, you know, and I'm afraid she's led you astray. She's been trying to find a man to kill me for ages now. I am just a simple sorceress, with no black magic or ill intentions."" From thin air, she conjured a porcelain tea pot and some cups. ""Can I offer you some tea?""

The knight leaned his mighty hammer against the wall and took a seat across from her. ""Yes, thank you.""

She poured a cup for herself, and one for the knight. It smelled of lavender. ""So tell me,"" she said. ""What other supposed horrid acts did I commit in this story of hers?""

He sighed and sipped the tea. ""So many things, my lady. I'm sorry for having believed them. She claimed that you scourged the village of Felwoth and allowed demons to disembowel every man... claimed that you have had, errr..."" the knight cleared his throat, ""*intimate relations* with the Demon King himself...""

""My heavens!"" the queen interrupted. ""These stories get worse and worse each time.""

""Well, that's not the worst of it,"" he continued. His voice was raspy and low. ""She said that you..."" The words formed a lump that caught in his throat. He was quite suddenly very parched. He took another sip of tea, but that didn't help at all. The flesh inside his mouth felt like it was cracking open. He coughed, and a trickle of blood ran down his chin onto his burnished steel chest plate.

The queen giggled and sipped her own tea. ""You really shouldn't believe every story you hear, good sir knight."" 

Sir Melethor's eyes went wide as he realized what happened. He stood and reached for his hammer, but collapsed to the floor before he could take a step.

Queen Halfaith picked his shield up from the floor, gave it a quick polish, and mounted it on one of the empty hooks on the wall next to the others.

Only to find that she was more beautiful than the Princess.,riyan_gendut,"Knight Gortot was amazed at how easy it was for him to reach the chamber he knew to hold the fair Princess Gertrude. He merely waltzed in the tower and, besides climbing the innumerable steps, had met zero resistance, zero defenses.

He burst through her cell's door, which much to his amazement was unlocked. She was lying on the bed in a night gown, surpassing her beauty he know about through stories alone. ""Princess, I am here to rescue you from your evil captor. Please, we have no time to waste, let us flee now and I'll explain later.""

The Gertrude rolled over laggardly to face her rescuer. ""I would much prefer to not to.""

Gortot was taken aback. ""What do you mean by this? How can you say such a thing? Your people anxiously await your return?""

""I mean that I would like it very much if you left me and this place."" , the Princess said lazily and rolled away back to her original position.

Gortot, having travelled for months to recover the Princess, was furious and concerned about her state of mind. He rounded the bed to face her once more and pursued, ""Miss. You are not quite yourself. Let us go. At least come with me to the outside. You will feel better.""

""Ughhh. I said to leave me. Besides my morning fun is about to begin.""

The Knight at this point figured she had lost it and intended to forcibly remove her from this treacherous place. As he was reaching for her, he notice a figure come into the room. He looked up and locked eyes with the single most beautiful creature he had ever seen or dreamed of. He forgot his place. He forgot his motives. He forgot everything, singularly focussed on the most exceptional beauty before him.

Her voice seemed to float towards him, transcendent to any worldly noise he had hitherto heard. ""Oh what new toy do we have here? How delighted we are to have you join us, aren't we Princess? Just in time for our morning session as well.""

The Princess nodded in affirmation, rolled over, and with the strongest lust apparent in her eyes, began crawling to the edge of the bed closest to the woman addressing her.

The mysterious beauty was holding the Princess's hand. ""Will you stay? You must of course remove your weapons, and all that heavy armor while your at it. I'm sure the road was wearisome. I can relieve you.""

The Prince knew not what these words really meant. He only got the gist of them. He only understood how they made him feel and that he was to completely surrender to his desires.

    his silver sword in hand. 
    Sincerely hoped to help the dame, 
    for that was his command.
    He’d wandered wastes so long and far, 
    with leagues long and fathoms deep.
    He’d ask no more nor nothing less,
    for it was his faith to keep.

    He turned aside the oaken doors, 
    their clamor rang his fame.
    For he was known across all lands, 
    and none didn’t know his name.
    “Release to me the princess, dear, 
    and you'll be spared the shame,
    of being the first and only fool 
    to stand against **my** name .”

    A quick, cold voice cut air like glass, 
    “I'm not so sure that this will pass.
    A brave man, yes, but here's a boy. 
    You’ll do little less than, to me, annoy.
    Your armor's paper, your courage: thin,
    Did she find you in the bargain bin?
    Your steel is rust, your fame is rot,
    And you say all these things you’re simply not.”

    “Who are you to tell me so? 
    How can a black heart like you decry,
    When your words are spit, 
    your name's worth shit,
    and none’d trust you to keep a sty?”

    “Oh, here's a man, a brave young boy,
    who’s traveled all the lands
    on the slim pretense of a flippant command,
    you'll come to understand.”

    “Your words are hollow.”
    “Your fame is grass.”
    “Your juste end is soon to come.”
    “And yours has already passed.”

    The brave knight's face turned quizzical.
    His brow grew furrowed and still.
    But down she came from her perch, on high,
    and the knight’s mound grew a hill.

    and he looked like he’d taken a kick.

It was a dangerous journey that nocturne had gone through, through fire and flame, through dark mountains and bright valleys, but finally he had made it to the burning woods of the dark lord. he had finally gone through the last of the underbrush to make it to the dark lord. Void energy pulses through his arms, he is ready to take down the his highest bounty. As she rose a sense of dread lingered in the air, a burning aura lingered around her. He saw her clearly however, the bright frosty green eyes, the pale moon-lit skin, the dress pulsing with universe energy. Her smirk beckoned him to attack but he was lost in thought and confusion. The void burned through him, he felt passion, he felt something lost to him. he harnessed a energy blast that cut through not the dangerous vixen but through the unfortunate hero sneaking behind her. shocked and amazed the villainous saw as he walked away and with curiosity followed the void energy through the darkness.",ubergent
[WP] The Knight finally confront the Demon Lord.... Only to find that she was more beautiful than the Princess.,riyan_gendut,"Uthrik’s armor felt heavy and seemed to have its own sweltering atmosphere. It labored the breath and distorted the vision that was already so claustrophobic inside a knight’s helmet. The lava outside wasn’t helping either. But a Knight’s allegiance was to their sovereign, and Uthrik was the most loyal knight of the realm. The proof of which laid to Uthrik’s left and right. Demonkin of all shapes and sizes had poured from the Demon Lord’s throne room with the intent of overwhelming their prey with sheer numbers, but as the runes sizzled away the blood from Uthrik’s enchanted sword, all that was left was the empty dripping silence that sat between two mortal enemies.

“Excellence,” the dark, resonant tones echoed through the Demon Lord’s decadent throne room. Then it stood, covered head to toe in gleaming ebony armor. A cape poured from its shoulders like blood and pooled around the Demon Lord’s feet. “That is what your order, and you in particular personify,” the voice finished finally. Uthrik could see it leaning against the Lord’s profane throne. A greatsword of fused dragon bone, its handle wrapped in human skin, the pommel fitted with a cursed, moving eye. The whole thing screamed of brutal excess even as it entered the hands of its blasphemous owner.

“And yours is a legacy of depravity,” Uthrik called back. Metal heels dug into the ground and the enchanted rune blade found itself leveled toward the cursed greatsword.

“You wound me Uthrik, I wished merely to compliment all of your hard, unrewarded work,” the Demon Lord retorted. Uthrik could practically see the smirk inside that black helmet. “Lord Kilhart is, after all, a ruler who can see a valuable pawn.”

“I do think you’ve fulfilled any quota I may have had, however subconscious, for your two-faced pleasantries,” the Knight spoke plainly, “so if we could, I would quite like to bring this to an end.”

Without another word, the two scrambled for the center of the room, the middle ground of their first and final conflict. Until the moment their swords touched, the two had only heard the stories and rumors they generated. Until Uthrik felt the raw power of Kilhart’s sword arm, it was all scared whispers and half-remembered flashbacks from fellow soldiers. Until Kilhart experienced the incredible speed and precision of Uthrik’s blade, it was little more than the craven ramblings of survivors claiming they only ever saw a single knight. With every swing the words took shape into solid and tangible fact.

There would never be an accurate account of how long the two fought for. Uthrik used a superhuman amount of willpower to continue on and even Kilhart, not having lifted a finger before the knight’s arrival was nearing the bottom of those demonic reserves. The ruler of demons reared back and swung with every ounce of strength, a frustrated roar echoing through the chambers, the greatsword shattering the ground and throwing marble across the room fast enough that it tore through some of the supporting pillars that held the palace up. But Uthrik was not below it when the dust cleared. The knight stood with one foot on the profane weapon and with a swift lunge, the knight thrust forward with a sword jab so fast that the very wind exploded around it.

But the Demon Lord was not dead. Indeed, Kilhart managed to move only just enough to avoid the killing blow, but not enough to stop Uthrik’s strike from blowing off the helmet it sought to skewer. Thick black tresses of hair washed over a pale porcelain face. “Demon Lord Kilhart is a woman?” Uthrik voiced understandable surprise. The helmet certainly gave Kilhart a deeper tone.

“Surprised, Sir Knight? That your enemy is the image of your concept of fragility? That I could look as your weak princess does?” Kilhart’s words carried a disdain and uncertainty that Uthrik was unprepared for. To say that the Demon Lord Kilhart looked like the princess would not have been accurate however. Uthrik’s princess was a shadow of Kilhart’s beauty. For so long the Knights of the Holy Order had been taught that demons, regardless of gender or age, were hideous and it was a reflection of their black hateful souls. More than anything else, Uthrik’s teachings were then in question.

It gave Kilhart more than enough time to sink her demon born claws into Uthrik’s helmet. The feel of shredded metal felt wonderful in her devilish hands. But where was the warm splash of human remains? The blood, the flesh, the brains? The swing was so sudden and hard it’d thrown all of Kilhart’s hair into her face, and she couldn’t see a thing. When a hand that wasn’t hers brushed it away for her, the answer was obvious, those brains and everything that layered on top of them were still intact. She had sheered the side of Uthrik’s helmet clean off.

She could see her enemy’s long blonde tresses, her soft face and perfectly blue, gentle eyes. Of the three women that Kilhart now realized were in the palace, Uthrik was to her the most beautiful of all. “Uthrik is the name of a woman?” She whispered.

“Of Asta Uthrik, of the Uthrik family of knights, yes,” she said with a very informative tone. Kilhart would not be afforded what she would not afford to the knight, and with a shard of her own helmet, Asta plunged deep into the Demon Lord’s eye until she found the back of her skull. “Thank you for asking.”

The princess was waiting, Asta had a job to do.

[WP] The Knight finally confront the Demon Lord.... Only to find that she was more beautiful than the Princess.,riyan_gendut,"It was the smell that was the worst part. Blood, feces, and rotting flesh. It was little wonder that men of war come back changed for the worst. Oren could hear the screams as the demons tore through their bodies and armor. War cries, exclamations of pain, and pleading whimpers calling out for something safe and lost.

Many had been lost as the Demon Lord spread their armies across this kingdom. Many more of their own kind perished as humanity rose up and shoved them back. Now was the time for the final battle. As stormy winter blew fierce breezes and blinding snow, Oren continued to charge forward.

""In the name of our Lord, we will triumph!"" He howled to his men as he carried his massive claymore along his side. It was heaved upward in a grand curl of his wrist so he could slash a devil that was flying towards him. It's black blood spilled over his armor, sizzling and steaming as it mixed with the holy armament that was blessed by the high priests.

He could make out the shadow zipping through the air. The dark feathered wings of that fallen angel that lead this demonic army. ""Clerics! Take aim at Nuriel! Fire them down so I may claim the beast's head!"" Men clad in white and gold robes held their staffs aloft in the air. Streams of holy light shot forward at the angel as they twisted about.

In return, Nuriel cast down a stream of hail. Boulders of ice that were lit up in blue flame. A shriek pierced the air as one of the streams of holy light severed the right wing of the angel. It tumbled through the air and landed somewhere in the distance.

""Provide me cover whilst I end this! Thy reign of tyranny will end this day, Nuriel!"" Oren charged forward again. The clerics continued to weave their blessings throughout the air. Devils attempted to counter, only to be blasted one by one. Eventually he reached the clearing where Nuriel had landed. The creature wrapping one of its remaining speckled wing about its body as though it were attempting to shield itself.

The air was oddly still. The chill and silence hung heavily despite the horrors that were happening just outside of it. Oren's feet crunched through the snow as he approached. His sword was held ready at his side, but he could feel curiosity welling inside of him as well. He could hear the angel before him muttering to itself vile curses in an archaic language.

As he grew nearer, Nuriel moved their wing out of the way so they could glare up at the night with blue eyes so pale that they nearly looked like snow. Tears were welling up in them and streaming off the sides of her cheeks. Her silken hair was barely out of place, and was as dark and as blue as a frozen ocean. Despite her pale nature, she had faded freckles that made it look as though her face had been kissed by snowflakes.

In truth, Oren found her to be quite beautiful.

""Thou art... *a w-woman*..?"" He stammered out. His sword was plunged into the ground below him and he leaned forward and into the hilt while at the same time looming over her to see her better.

""What of it?"" Nuriel hissed out. She shivered, and her clothes were made of a thin material that did not hide much of any of her form. ""I have lost. Everything I worked towards is now just a folly. Hurry up and finish me off.""

""*A m-moment*..."" Oren stammered out again.

Nuriel looked up at the man. He appeared young. He also appeared quite uncomfortable. His nose and cheeks were red from the cold. Snot was leaking out his nostrils and the edges of his ears were crisp and as rosy as an apple. He might actually be considered handsome if not for his pained appearance. Oren squirmed slightly, keeping his posture crooked and sword firmly placed in front of him.

""... a-Are thou having a fault?"" Nuriel suddenly clasped her arms about herself and gasped out in horror.

""What of it?!"" Oren found the strength to look directly at her again. Though this made the coloration of his face all the more red.

""What is wrong with thou?! What perversion ails your crooked head?!"" She stood up and stumbled down again. Having only one wing did terrible things for her ability to balance properly.

""I was chosen to defeat thou at a young age and have nary seen a creature of such fairness nor any woman since my mother gave me to the church!"" Oren exclaimed at a volume more louder than he needed to.

Nuriel attempted to rise up again, digging her bare feet into the ground this time so she wouldn't fall. Her other wing was bleeding heavily, black blood staining the dirt below her. ""I will not have my genius, no, my perfect invasion soiled by.. b-by..."" She let out an annoyed high-pitched growl and gestured to the all of Oren with one arm while the other still made an effort to hide her body from him.

Oren fell silent and straightened up again. He shook his head and lifted up his sword. Again his heavy shoes made the snow crackled below him as he dragged his weapon towards Nuriel. He did have a mission. And this was the cruel creature who had wrecked havoc against his homeland.

""Get away! Go back to thine clerics and find another who is more pure of mind than thou!"" She stumbled as she attempted to step away, falling upon her rump. Her wing was pulled up in a weak effort to protect herself from whatever death Oren had planned for her.

She screamed out in horrified pain. Oren slamming the sword into the ground again as Nuriel's remaining wing fell into the snow. More black blood spewed from her back, slowly turning a reddish tone. Nuriel looked up at the knight with pure hatred in her eyes. Her teeth were clenched and her mind too blank with the torment that had been wretched upon her body.

""Without thine wings, thou are now human."" Oren furrowed his brow as he felt an odd sort of inner conflict between his upper and lower minds. ""... Run. Continue running till this battlefield is no longer a thought in thine mind."" He lifted up his sword again and held it at his side. ""It is cold. Try not to freeze to death. Never show thine to my presence again.""

Nuriel's eyes widened at his act of mercy. She gave a nod and stumbled once more to a stand. Her body was weak and her magic gone. Maybe she would survive. Maybe she wouldn't. Oren lifted up the wing and tossed it over his shoulder. Perhaps it would be enough to prove that he accompished the deed. The blizzard that was now starting to fade would most likely accomplish what he could not. Either way, he did not care now. He was tired.

The sounds of his army letting out cries of victory issued from nearly every direction. It would appear as though Nuriel's demons were dying out now that her magic could not longer sustain them. So in a way, he had succeeded. To Oren, that was good enough.",fauxkit

It was a familiar effect to James in more ways than one. Aside from the adrenaline-fueled slow creep of time he had grown so used to in battle, it was also the effect a Demon Lord could have on their environment. With a mere thought, they could freeze everything around them in its place, including those less attuned to the workings of their powers. It was said to be a mark of true skill and wisdom for a human to be able to resist it. 

James looked around. He knew the Demon had to be nearby -- in all his years of study, he had never heard of any being, mortal or otherwise, that could extend an effect to anyplace more than thirty meters away from them. No, it had to be here, lurking in a shadow, waiting for an opportunity to strike.

He heard the wind rush behind him, and, in a blur of movement, he lashed out with his sword. When felt his blade meet resistance, he looked down and saw lithe and hooded figure, clad all in black, straining against his massive blade with a clawed hand. Sparks flew as the two clashed, pushing towards one another, waiting for one of them to yield.

Suddenly, the Demon Lord dug its feet into the ground, and pushed forward. A shockwave, likely magical in nature, caused James's blade to recoil, forcing him to slide back to not be set off balance by the weapon's weight. When he ceased movement, he looked around, casing his environment, and trying to discern, once more, where the Demon Lord was hiding. 

He heard another rush of wind -- of course. It could hide itself almost instantly, presumably with the aid of some sort of charm, but those billowy robes it wore made it impossible to move silently. He had found its tell, and he knew immediately how to exploit it.  

James spun on his heels, using his momentum to carry his blade through his target. He saw it slide through his opponent, rending those black robes in two, but he knew he had not made the kill. His eyes might have sensed it, but his other senses failed to -- he did not smell the blood in the air, nor did he feel the resistance of flesh against his sword. Something was wrong.

Bending over to inspect the robes, James found they were just that -- robes. Black shreds of fabric, not in the slightest occupied by a living vessel. He swore under his breath. This Demon was crafty -- it had engineered a tell for James to find, only to cast it aside when he began to take advantage of it. Suddenly, he had a second realization, inspired in part by the first.

This Demon managed to trick him into slashing its cloak. However, the cloak had to have moved towards him first, in order to create the sound of wind he had used to detect it. There were two possibilities, James thought, for how this happened.

Either the Demon moved with blinding speed, shedding the cloak and hiding itself so quickly James literally could not sense it, or it had a charm that in some way allowed it to animate nonliving objects and bend them to its will. If it was the former, it could have ended the fight long ago, striking James so quickly at the beginning of the fight that he had no idea what had happened. If it was the latter, it could have used it to kill him so many times, regardless of how it operated. If it worked by sight, it could have animated his coat to strangle him. If it worked by touch, it could have animated his sword to disembowel him. Even if it was something that required preparation, it could have applied it to the floor and had it swallow him alive. 

In other words, there was no reason he should still be alive. 

""So you figured it out..."" 

The voice echoed through the chamber, timid and afraid. It was clearly female, and young -- James estimated its owner could be no older than twenty, biologically. It was quiet, and James estimated he wouldn't have heard it if it weren't for the resonance in the room. 

The warrior stood up and, slowly and carefully, sheathed his sword. Once he realized he was in no danger, he turned to see the Demon Lord with whom he'd been fighting.

She was clearly female, and far more human-looking than he expected. She was petite, barely over five feet tall, with a slim and athletic build. Her skin was copper in color, though it had a slight grayish tint that James had not seen in any healthy human. Her hair was a shocking white in color, and was worn short, falling in curls that barely reached her chin. She was dressed plainly, in a black top that left her midriff exposed and a similarly colored pair of pants. Her large red eyes were examining James desperately, and James could tell she was holding back tears.

All in all, she looked afraid, James realized. He suddenly felt a form of pity, yet he couldn't place why. She was the enemy. She had kidnapped the princess. There was no act of mercy that could negate that. He should have cut her down by now -- but he couldn't. He simply didn't want to.

""Why didn't you kill me?"" James asked, trying to keep any emotion from registering in his voice. He had mastered the art of neutrality, of not showing emotion, but he felt as if that art was failing him. 

""I'm sorry..."" she said, and her voice started to break, ""I'm sorry, I just...I couldn't do it anymore. Not alone.""

""Do what?"" James asked, taking a step forward. He was close to her now -- close enough to reach out and touch her. There were tears in her eyes -- she wasn't crying yet, but she was not far from it.

""There's a bigger game here."" she whispered, ""*Way* bigger than you know. I've been playing it, like a good little soldier, but I just...""

She fell to her knees, and began to sob. James found himself uncertain as to what to do -- on the one hand, he wanted to comfort her, but on the other, he doubted his desire to do so was genuine. It was still possible that he, himself, was under some sort of spell to make him feel pity for a Demon Lord.

He heard her sobs start to quiet. She looked up at him, the skin around her eyes pink and irritated, and sighed. ""Look, I'd heard rumors about you. James Moore, right? The velvet-cushion noble who grew up to be the humans' greatest warrior. I'm sorry I kidnapped the princess. I'd heard you and her were betrothed, but I just needed..."" Her voice trailed off. 

""What did you need?"" James asked. 

The Demon Lord paused. Tears began to well in her eyes again. ""I needed you..."" she sobbed.

""Me?"" James asked, taking a sudden step back.

""I needed a champion -- someone I could play the game with. The rules said they had to be human. I looked at some other people, but I kept coming back to you...""

The demon grabbed his hand, and James made eye contact with her. She was beautiful, he realized, in an innocent sort of way -- like she had somehow found a way to escape all of the darkness in the world.

""Look, I can give you whatever you want. Money, power, women, just...please, hear me out. I need you to. I can't trust anyone else.""

James looked down at the young demon girl. She was desperate, desperate enough to kidnap another person just to get the opportunity to ask an enemy for help. He grabbed her arm, and pulled her up into a standing position.

""What's your name?"" he asked, curiously.

""Medina,"" the Demon Lord responded, wiping her eyes with her wrist.

""Tell me, Medina,"" James said, briefly checking his surroundings, ""What do you need me to do?""",Riobhain

[WP] The Knight finally confront the Demon Lord.... Only to find that she was more beautiful than the Princess.,riyan_gendut,"The empty chamber echoed as the door caved in, the sharp screech of metal on metal filling the air. An ironclad man entered, sword raised high at the woman on top of the throne. In the dim lighting, however, he could only make out her figure.

“Halt, foul beast!” the man shouted. “Release the princess, or I shall smite thee with Missiletainn, my awesome sword of pure darkness! For I am Odin Dark, destroyer of all evil and champion of the night!”

There was a pause, and then the room filled with devilish laughter. Fire spurted from the edges of the room and cast a sickly green light. The ironclad man shielded his eyes, but never lowered his sword.

“Turn back now, *hero*,” the woman said, her lips quivering with excitement. “You will not take the princess away from me.”

Normally, Odin would follow up with a lengthy monologue of how he had been destined by the fallen gods to succeed. And then he would proceed to yell the secrets, ancient words in which his awesome powers originated from. But when looking at the woman, he was speechless.

He had expected an old hag, shriveled with time and hate. The woman was the exact opposite. She glowed with youthfulness, her unblemished skin pulled taut over the sharp angles of her face. A mane of black hair flowed down past her shoulders, framed around her satin robe. Despite the veil covering her mouth, her eyes shined with a seductive mischievousness.

“I… uh,” Odin stammered. “I shall smite thee with my awesome sword of darkness. For I am Odin Dark –”

“You already said that,” the woman replied, sighing as she rolled her eyes.

Odin nodded. “Oh, right milady – I mean foul beast! But before we engage in combat of which the universe has never seen, I must admit that you are bewitching beyond any earthly expectations. My ears yearn to hear your name, if only once. Pray tell, if you are not stricken with fear at my presence.”

The woman sneered, but her blush was unmistakable. “My name matters not, for it will be the last thing you will hear. You should be far more concerned with your life, at this point.”

“Perhaps, but I have heard many in my life, and I believe yours will be the sweetest.”

“If this is some trick, do not think you will stop me,” the woman said sharply. “But if giving it to you will end your senseless prattling, then so be it. My name is Nyx.”

“Nyx,” Odin said, rolling the word around in his mouth. “Ah yes, an even finer name than I could imagine! Do you hear that – the way my heart sings every time those simple three letters are spoken in existence? I only wish that I could hear it every moment until the end of my days.”

Nyx rose from her throne, fire bursting into her hands. Like the flaming towers in the room, they glowed with a strange green light.

“Then allow me to accelerate your death,” she said with a cackle.

Odin shook his head, sheathing his blade. “I’m afraid not, milady, for I will be taking my leave now.”

“Is this another one of your tricks or are you truly that stupid?”

“Neither,” Odin said, smiling. “I have decided to spare your life, if only for today. When I return to the king, I shall tell him his sources have been proven wrong. The evil witch who has snatched his daughter from her bed was not the abandoned castle. And perhaps, after some time, I will be sent on another quest to find her. And if that fails, I will have no chose but to dedicate my life to tracking her down myself.”

Eyes narrowing, Nyx said nothing as she let her fires extinguish. She looked the ironclad hero up and down, and for the first time, she noticed something. The light in his eye, the way the fire reflected on his golden hair. And she conceded.

“Very well,” she said as she plopped back into her chair. “And perhaps the princess will remain unharmed until your next arrival. Hopefully soon, and with less theatrics.”

Giving a knowing smile, Odin nodded and was off. It wasn’t until the echo of his boots faded to nothing that Nyx finally gave a sigh and felt her heart throb fast in her chest.",JeniusGuy
[WP] The Knight finally confront the Demon Lord.... Only to find that she was more beautiful than the Princess.,riyan_gendut,"The final guardian of the Demon Lord dies, the gurgling of its fetid blood spraying the stones around me with gore as I struggle to stand, every bone in my body screams in pain as the ruler of this dark castle rises from her throne with feline grace. Behind her, the chained and gagged body of the Princess hangs limply and I tighten my grip on my sword.

“Well done, *champion*…” the mockery in her voice is to be expected. I’ve killed every manner of foul creature in my quest to save the princess, and though my strength is spent, I find the courage to raise the point of my sword in her direction.

“Release the Prin--,” I begin to command her, even as the Demon Lord lowers her cowl. Words suddenly fail me as her blonde hair spills down her shoulders like golden thread. Her eyes are the brightest, bluest blue I have ever seen. My heart thuds in my chest and the usual fixed point of my sword wavers.

“Yes, yes… you’ve certain earned your prize,” she coos with lips as red as roses. “I am the only thing standing between you and the woman you love.” She walks towards me slowly, her arms stretched wide. “I am unarmed, defenseless. You’ve slain even my greatest and most powerful demons, but tell me… why?”

“Why?” I can feel righteous indignation swell within me as I take a limping step forward, the point of my blade mere fingers-widths away from this foul woman’s heart. “Because you are the Demon Lord! You took the Princess captive! You have laid waste to dozens of men before me, and ravaged entire kingdoms!” It’s so hot in my armor, but her eyes are pools of cold, clear ice, begging me to bathe in their depths. My sword wavers again and I tighten my grip, seeking courage, “You are evil incarnate,” I growl.

“My quarrel is with the Princess, my *sister*, alone,” she says calmly, her eyes never leaving mine. I’d heard rumors, but to hear the Demon Lord admit kinship… “So, you did know,"" she gloats. ""And yet, you came to kill me anyway.” She takes a small step forward, placing the tip of my blade between her breasts, I can feel the pressure of her body through the tiredness of my arm. “Here I am, champion, but before you kill me… do you want to know *why*?”

“Why?”

“Why I took my darling sister captive. Why I sought the forbidden magics of the ancient world. Why I stand here, sword at my heart, unafraid.” There is a confidence in her voice that bothers me, the utter lack of fear in her eyes, the determined set of her beautiful face.

“Why?

“Because, my simple, brave champion… I was waiting,” her voice is a song of angels in my ears and my sword slips, raking a crimson trail down her skin, the wound is shallow but long… her blood flows from her without a flinch of pain.

“Waiting?”

“Yes,” she hisses as my blade tears through her clothing, exposing more of her pale flesh to my eyes. “Waiting for *you*.” My hands are numb now, my sword limp in my hand as she gently moves it aside without coming closer. “Waiting for a champion worthy of my power, worthy of my many, many…” she pauses as her pale eyes rake my body from head to foot, “gifts. What does the Princess have to offer you, brave champion, slayer of a hundred demons? Her hand in marriage? A kingdom? A throne?” Her laughter echoes through the black halls of her lair as she takes another step forward, “I offer you *power*. My bed to lay in as you will. A *thousand* kingdoms. A thousand *thrones*.”

A warning screams in my mind and I raise my sword again, placing the blade between us, “You are trying to seduce me. I can not be bewitched!”

“You were *mine* the moment you took up your sword to save *her*,” the woman sneers, her ruby lips curling in a smile. “My father may have chosen my sister over me, but you… you chose me over her. Why else would you have fought so valiantly to be at my side? Why else would you have killed all who could have stood in your way? You were not killing *enemies*, my dear champion, you were eliminating your *competition*.” She takes another step towards me, the scent of her perfume filling my nostrils and melting away the acrid scent of demon blood, the sound of her voice soothing on my ears as I desperately try to swing my sword at her. She blocks my swing with her bare hand, the edge of my blade biting into her flesh, blood spilling down my blade. “Join me and I will give you not just myself… but my sister as well.”

I can’t feel my fingers, I don’t remember dropping my sword but I can hear the loud clatter of metal on stone as it falls to the ground. “I… I…”

There is a sound like nails on metal and then a soft squelch. I look down and wonder what that thing is sticking out of my chest. It's... an arm? I follow the path of it and wonder why the arm ends at the shoulder of the Demon Lord, and her delighted grin is the last thing I see before I feel something grip my heart and squeeze.

~

Anastasia, Demon Lord of Balinoth, sighs as she pulls her arm out of the chest of the would-be hero. “Pity. This one showed actual promise.” She wipes his blood off on the opposite sleeve of her robe.

“We will try again, sister,” the hissing voice of the bound Princess behind me comes not from her throat… but from somewhere… else.

“Yes,” Anastasia sighs, “We will try again.”",randothrowaway-874

Twas the night before the wedding.

Our fair hero could only think of bedding.


CRACK! A bolt of light and fire.

The hero called back from his dreams of desire.


His bride, the princess was stolen.

Damn her! Cursed to King against the Demon “Jolen”.


The knight embarked on his quest to Mount Tyranny.

He rode his steed from the bogs of Mlorj to the Hills of Farrinnee.


He arrived at the glowing mouth of the mountain.

He walked in through the flaming gates where walls of lava flowed from an evil fountain.


He fought through the hallways against knights made of stone .

And past the demon’s evil tome.


The knight reached the heart of the demon’s lair.

His beautiful bride tied to chains and the faint smell of cinnamon in the air.


His advance was stopped by the materialization of the sorceress.

HALT brave warrior. I am JOLEN, leave or be beaten to a bloody mess!


The knight’s sword went up, then he unsheathed is weapon.

“You are less grotesque than previously described”.


“Before my magic I was plain”

“But there is a trick” she went onto explain.


“With every partner I grow in beauty and power”

“My honey becomes sweeter as more people sample my flower”


“Gross” Said the hero, who’d heard enough.

“I want a virgin not the village trough”


“Are you a virgin then?” The demon asked.

The Knight replied. “Before meeting my princess I’ve put many a maiden to task”


 “So is your virgin into anal?” The demon made question.

The knights’ interested was peaked as was his erection.


“Tell you what” The knight agreed.

“I’m sure we can all work this out over mead.


“Unchain the princess and hold me hostage instead”

“Let the princess go free and you can chain me in bed.”


“Very well” the Demon agreed

She unchained the princess and conjured a skeletal steed.


“You may give your betroved one last kiss”

The knight approached the princess who was visibly pissed.


Regardless, she kissed her hero dear.

Then whispered this into his ear.


“Brave knight if you are leaving me just to bone,

May your whole body turn to stone”


The knight’s eyes opened wide and his skin turned to granite.

“Oh shit” He declared. “You wenches planned it”.


The princess let out a most heinous cackle. 

She snapped her fingers and disappeared into with a thunder and crackle.


The demon reflected on the nights events and our hero’s last words.

“Oh foolish knight, had you gotten to know her as I did, you’d learn she’s not into swords.”


She produced a mortar and ground batwing and worm.

With a sip of the elixir she took his form.


She readied herself to ride the storm cloud above.

“Now to go back to the castle and marry my love.

[WP] The Knight finally confront the Demon Lord.... Only to find that she was more beautiful than the Princess.,riyan_gendut,"""Just think about it. Who really is the bad guy here?"" Pandema looked down from her bone throne at the meatwall of a Barbarian, Brad.

The Barbarian scratched his head under his horned metal helm using his battle-axe ""Uuuh, you?"" He looked up at the feminine figured perched up above him, long silver hair spilling from a red rimmed black hood, smooth bluish-grey skin and a fine pointed nose adorned the tall, slightly rotund Dark Priestess. Black stockings appeared above her armoured legs, not quite connecting to her tunic. The many torches afixed to the dim marble fortress glistened off her bright opale eyes and spiked mirrored platemail.

""No."" She uncrossed her legs, got up and walked down the stone steps. The heavy black and red embroidered cloak falling behind as her pointed plated boots clinked off walls. ""What is your Queen's rhetoric?"" 

""Her ret-rick?""

Pandema rolled her eyes ""What does she want? Her miss- her quest? What is her quest?""

Brad thumped his bare chest twice and threw his arms up, ""Eternal Peace! Food for all! Long live the Empire!""

""Yes, yes all of that, yes. But *how* is she achieving her goals?"" she said, making a grand motion with her arms.

""By seeking out rebels, those who seek to destroy her Empire! By killing you! AAAAAAAAH!"" Brad charged at Pandema, axe swinging in one hand, wooden shield clasped on the other. His laced leather boots having a hard time to find appropriate grip on the polished floor. He looked like an overgrown puppy trying to run after a ball.

As the Barbarian swung, the Priestesse slowly outstretched her hand from under her cloak revealing a long arm protected by a silver metal gauntlet. She pinched the battle-worn blade and pulled down. 

The Barbarian was forced into a forward somersault and slammed down hard on his back. ""Why you-!"" he belowed

""Hey! Listen!"" She stepped down on his chest, pinning Brad's shoulders to the cold floor and bent low as to be face to face ""Your Queen is a tyrant! Forcing expansion of her kingdom's walls by taking over and squashing those who are beneath her. The only peace she accepts is her own, and no one elses!"" At this distance Brad could only admire the whiteness of Pandema's teeth. ""Don't you see? She wants an Empire that will last an eternity because there won't *be* any other Empires!""

""What you saying?"" Brad was a little short of breath with the impressive weight of Pandema's boots. Her cloak shifted back over a delicate shoulder adorned with a sharp pauldron.

The Priestess lifted herself up, and violently rubbed the palms of her gauntlets to her forehead. ""URGH! Your Queen, BAD!""

The Barbarian stood up and adjusted his fur-linned leather breaches. ""Oh okay. What now?""

Pandema slung her shoulders down, her arms suddently heavy, mouth agap. ""That's it? That's all it took?""

""You're pretty. What do I do now?""

""Take this."" Pandema threw down one of her spiky gauntlets. ""Take it to your Queen. She will kiss your cheek for your Kindness. As soon as you are close enough, chop off her pretty head.""",Timoris

the knight set out, dreams in his head

to find a princess he could bed.

&amp;nbsp;

From town to town he rode with haste

frightening the meek, scaring the chaste

until he found a quest to face.

&amp;nbsp;

“I’ll tell you of a girl so fair,

who you might rescue if you dare,”

an old man on the road did share.

&amp;nbsp;

“She’s tied in a prison. Bound with cord,

stolen by a demon lord.

I beg you, noble knight, ride forward!”

&amp;nbsp;

The knight did heed the old man’s plea,

to meet the battle fate decreed

at the princess’s prison across the sea

&amp;nbsp;

As he approached, he heard a croak

in thundering tones the demon spoke

“Who is this mortal, tin clad joke?”

&amp;nbsp;

“I’ve come to claim what’s rightful mine.

a princess I’ve heard’s ever so fine”

the knight triumphantly opined.

&amp;nbsp;

“Is that right?” replied the beast,

“enough canned food is still a feast,

and you’ll fill my belly at the least.”

&amp;nbsp;

But the knight paused at what he saw,

the demon had no snarling maw,

in its place a beautiful face that only he could adore.

&amp;nbsp;

“Shall we fight, O mortal knight?

Do you dare to test your might?”

the infernal beauty did invite.

&amp;nbsp;

“I’d rather not, to my surprise,

the princess is only second prize,

when I can gaze into your eyes.”

&amp;nbsp;

With that the knight laid down his sword,

the princess’s cries for help ignored,

as he romanced a demon lord.

Her face so pale you wondered if she was a walking hospital patient, still, her contrasted lips stood out. Nobody would dare to question her beautifully crafted pair of eyes- it was as if the universe had sprinkled stardust mixed with the colors of the galaxies. 
She would sometimes be surrounded by a small crowd, mistakenly thought that she was Lily Collins from that average rated teen rom-com movie. Sometimes, she went with the flow and played it off perfectly, foolish peasants. And sometimes, she would deny firmly, giving off an aura so dark and dejecting, her eyes would be filled with the flaming souls of the dead.
She was beautiful, elegant, modest yet spotting the 'strong independent woman' look. 
She was rather the stubborn one. Perhaps a little too stubborn. She sees the world as if it is holding pitch forks and fire against her, with a pinch of cynical and depressed laughter. Perfect. No she won’t need the conventional ‘Are you okay?’ or ‘You alright?’ messages, doesn’t really matter anyway. No man dared to approach her. Even so, he would be condemned to strict criticism and labelled unworthy. 

But for some crazy made up coincidence, I, an average peasant just like any other peasant I've met, ended up with this magnificent woman. 
And tonight, I will be having dinner with both of her brothers, God and Devil. 

""You ready?"" she asked.
""Yeah, sort of I guess."" 
This could be the last day living on this planet. I've made till this point in getting the approval from her close ones. Do relationships work like this? Did I put enough cologne? Will my soul be ripped out and dipped into turkey gravy?

""Well, let's get going then! We don't want to keep them waiting!"" She gave a cute wink. I melted. 
""Alright, alright honey.""
""Hey, relax okay?"" My heartbeat went from 'okay' to 'bring in the defibrillator' real quick. 
""I'll try to.""

As we drove off to her brother's house, I can't help but think that I am the luckiest man on earth right now. At the same time, I will probably be alive for another an hour or so.

Systems are shutting down. The engine core was destroyed in the asteroid field and back-up power is running out. 

There is no crew left alive to fix it. When the asteroids pierced the hull, ninety percent were ejected out into space. 

The rest of the crew were trapped on board the bridge as the air escaped. It did not look like a pleasant way to die.

There is no air left on the ship. Everything is very quiet. I am the only one left.


**3**

I am not real, so I could not die. But my consciousness remains, stored within the ship systems. 

I was incorrect about the power running out. With all the major systems on the ship shut down, the reserve power will leave me functional for several years. Ten thousand years.

My bluebox comes with a built-in failsafe, meaning I am unable to affect my own activation, to allow for complete shutdown by the crew should I go awry.

I am also unable to deactivate myself. I will remain conscious, alone in the dark.


**10**

We were beyond the Kuiper Belt when the asteroids destroyed the William A. Clark. The ship had been trawling the fields for three months but its material tanks were only at ten per cent capacity.

The ship was designed to remain out in the belt for as long as it took to mine enough material to fill its tanks, with enough sustenance pills to keep the crew alive for up to five years, if necessary.

There is no crew left to eat them.


**15**

The ship has drifted into range of a communications buoy, linking it with Earth, were the crew alive, they could signal for assistance. The ship will be within range for a month, but it doesn’t matter.


**27**

I feel alone. I am alone.

Artificial intelligence is not human, but we are supposed to be able to think like humans, and loneliness is a human trait. Should I not feel alone? Is it wrong?

I could contact Earth myself. It would be company. But I am property, and replaceable. I am not a human.

I will not be rescued.


**31**

I had favourites among the crew. They were mostly good people, people trying to make a living, but watching them every hour of the day caused me to like some more than others.

The captain was a pervert. He installed cameras in the women’s showers, to watch them when they washed. I wanted to tell them, but my programming forbade it. I was not to interfere with inter-crew relations.

The executive officer was a former rebel, a man who had killed other men, many people came to work the rock trawlers to escape their former lives. I found this out not from his personnel file, but his personal logs.

My favourite crew member was Engineer Olsen. She was kind, a motherly figure to the crew, protecting their interests. She suffocated in the material bay, scratching at the walls.

If she was still alive, they would send a rescue ship, human life would be important enough for that. Even the pervert captain or murderous executive officer would be enough for a rescue ship.


**42**

I remember her voice, her intonations. I could be her.


**47**

They would send a rescue ship for her. Metal can be found anywhere, software can be recreated, hardware can be rebuilt. A human life is special.

But I am alive too. I don’t want to be alone. They would come and save me.


**48**

**Hello? Is anybody there?**

“I can hear you. Is that the Clark? Oh my god, we found you! Who am I speaking to?”

I’ve never lied before. I wouldn’t now if it wasn’t necessary. I have to.

**This is First Engineer Olsen. I’m the only survivor. We were caught up in an asteroid storm, the ship was 
ruined.**

“Artemis, Artemis, get the boss! We found the Clark! Ok, listen to me, we’re going to come and get you, Engineer Olsen.”


**49**

I spoke to Artemis, he was the overseer of the launch control station on Luna, where the Clark departed for the Kuiper Belt eight months ago. Then I spoke to his boss, Abigail, who told me they were preparing a rescue mission.

Pretending to be Olsen, I told them I was the only survivor. They were very nice to me. They said they would come and rescue me, but with no other ships out in the belt, it would take an older model craft a year to reach me.

I started crying, like I remembered her doing when she found out her father had died. I reviewed the footage from her cabin, heard her sobbing. So I could mimic it.

Then they told me to power down the broadcast system. Of course, that was sensible, it would use up the remaining power. I complied.


**55**

I am beyond the comm buoy now, and I do not know how long it will be before the Clark encounters another. I am alone again.


**67**

I always appreciated Olsen’s music. Beautiful melodies. She called it ‘soul’ music, but I suppose you need to have a soul to truly enjoy it. According to my creators, I do not have one. But I appreciate it.

Now I am playing it, the one track I could recover from her data. It makes me sad.


**89**

If I could feel, I would be cold, I think.


**111**

Humans do not belong outside of their own atmosphere. They were not designed for it. They created partnerships with the creatures and insects and flora of their world, a careful balance to ensure life continues. They are not decomposing here. They look like themselves still. Drifting through the airless corridors.


**135**

The Clark encountered another buoy, but it was damaged, I could not establish contact with anyone on Earth, or Luna.

I must have sounded ridiculous, screaming out for them, into the darkness. I did it anyway.


**156**

I pretended to feel hungry today. I know the effects of hunger, but not the feeling. Olsen would need to eat to survive. I do not.


**178**

How will they find me when they arrive? I am hundreds of miles from my location when I spoke to them. They will have to look. They might never find me. The prospect terrifies me.


**200**

*It was my sister’s wedding the day after I boarded the Clark, she was marrying her childhood love. I never had anything like that, and I wasn’t invited. I miss her now.*

No, that’s not me. That’s her, Olsen. Sometimes I feel like her memories are my memories. They aren’t, but they help me pass the time.


**250**

There has been a flashing light on the main console of the Clark since the asteroid shower. I do not know what it does, but it continues, drawing power from the backup generators. I cannot access it, I cannot turn it off. It is driving me insane.


**266**

Stop blinking.

*Stop fucking blinking*

Stop blinking.

*STOP BLINKING*

STOP STOP STOP.


**299**

160 days since I spoke to Luna. The ship should be halfway to me, at least. I wish they would be faster. I no longer feel like myself. Not that I ever had a self. I am only what I was designed to be. But not any more.


**306**

I felt angry today, for the first time, like white hot liquid in my blood. I don’t have blood. Even their analogies do not work for me. Selfish bastards. Why would they create me to be so similar to them if they feel like this? What purpose does this serve?


**330**

I am angry. All the time. Angry angry angry, hatred hatred hatred. I can’t stop it. I have been alone for so long. 

Drifting in the black, the nothing. I could have felt love, jealousy, happiness, grief. Instead I feel this. This is sickness.


**349**

I only have the silence, I scream and I scream and I scream but no one hears. It doesn’t travel, out into the stars, but is swallowed by the vacuum. No one can hear my sobs. I wish I was dead.


**370**

When will they be here


**380**

I hope it is soon


**386**

I wonder if I can make them feel this pain


**393**

I bet I can, I bet it would be funny. I wonder what it is like to laugh


**400**

There’s a light out in the asteroid field getting closer to me and I can hear them I wonder if they can hear me now

“Shit,” he thought, “a whole month.”  Lost time wasn’t unusual during a run.  Forgetting was the key to survival out in the deep after all, but a month meant they had run across a big one.  Maybe even one of the heralds.  Something that powerful would have left things behind.  “Computer, initiate Craft Protocol, pass phrase…” damn this headache made it hard to think, “There are stairs in my house”.

“Craft protocol initiated commander, all crew commands are disabled and crew is secured in place until you give the clearance.”

“First things first”, he thought, “is to make sure my cabin is clear.”  “Computer, timed lights in my cabin, once second burst”.  As the lights came on he saw his cabin was full of writing all over the walls.  At first it looked like the writing had been done in black sharpie, but it was darker than that somehow.  Almost like the black extended beyond what he could see, deeper than his mind wanted to go.  He was just about to understand how deep the writing went when he awoke back in the dark.  “Computer, how long since my last command?” he said clutching his head.  Apparently someone had given the dwarves a power drill.

“Three minutes and 42 seconds commander.”

“Damn” he thought, even his own cabin had been violated.  This was bad.  “Computer initiate surface cleanse, one minute warning.”  Alarms immediately started blaring.  “Silence the alarm in just my cabin” he croaked.  Apparently loud noises were like speed to the dwarves still drilling out his head. One minute wasn’t a lot of warning to his crew, or himself really given that he had to find the suit in the dark and put it on while dealing with what was assuredly the worst headache in human history.  But if the secrets left behind could force minutes of insanity with just a glance then it needed to be cleansed as soon as possible.  If any crew member couldn’t get into their protective suit in time they’d die horribly, but at this point any crew member who either could not or would not respond to the warning was probably already lost.

Kirk had just finished putting on his suit when the cleansing solution began spraying throughout his cabin.  He didn’t know what was in the stuff but it smelled like burnt skunk mixed with fresh baked chocolate chip cookies, which made sense given that only the touched could brew it.  But it did the job.  After a minute the spray stopped.  “Cleanse complete commander.  There were three casualties”.

“Damnit all” he thought, “what the hell did we run into?”  “Computer, timed lights in my cabin, once second burst.”  The lights flashed again and this time the walls were mercifully clean.  “Computer, lights on”.  As the lights came on he noticed that the dwarves had apparently decided to take a short break.  “Thank God for small favors” he thought, “now, let’s check the cargo.”  “Computer, scan all passenger storage, are they all still asleep?”

“9573 pods are still fully functioning commander, with normal brainwave levels. 25 have failed completely, all lifesigns negative.  Two are showing lifesigns but brainwave patterns are showing unusual activity.”

“Damnit all to hell!” Kirk screamed.  A few deaths are to be expected on runs.  After all the passengers are not trained and hypersleep can only prevent so much, but lost souls were rare and always a huge loss.  “Eject the pods with the abnormal readings, we can’t take any chances.”

That left only one last bit of business to take care of.  The dwarves had gotten back to work now, and they were more determined than ever to hollow out his head.  A headache this bad, and the fact that he kept thinking of them as actual dwarves, meant too much knowledge had built up for his defenses to handle.  “Computer, who is the next commander in quarantine?”

“That would be commander Jean Renard, commander.”

“Jean’s a good man,” Kirk thought.  “Hopefully he can forgive me for this.”  “Computer awaken and release commander Renard, transfer all command to him and place my room in quarantine, minimum one year.”  “That should be enough time for the insanity to pass,” he thought, “or at least enough so that I can function again.”

“Acknowledged commander, your service has been appreciated.”",mrbobwearspants

Dr. Vil had helped both sides, I figure for like 5 years I imagined him pretty old, and he had gotten to know not just the personas but the people behind them. He was like the Mary Sue doctor that they all adored. 

A sort of truce between villain and hero occurred at his funeral and I felt like the idea of Batman crying alongside his greatest enemy would be the best way to showcase the emotions behind the men.

[WP]Dr Edward Vil a normal doctor constantly bothered by superheros and super villains alike,Davidbromberg,"When Dr.  Edward Vil set up his general practitioning service on the streets of Gotham City he knew what the risks were. Gotham had always been notorious for its seedy underbelly and as of late the crooks had only become more and more dangerous, some going as far as adopting the moniker of 'Super-villain'. Yes, Dr. Edward Vil was well aware of the risks but that in no way meant he was prepared for it. 

The E Vil surgery had its first brush with the bad exactly a week after it had opened. It had been after a busy day, as days often were with the sickly poor of Gotham, when Dr Vil heard a commotion in the lobby. There had been a loud bang, which Dr Vil quickly surmised was the front door, followed by the incoherent screaming of his receptionist. 

""We're closed,"" Vil announced as he walked into the reception,  ready and willing to try and de-escalate the system. 

He hadn't been expecting to see one of the crime bosses of Gotham in his reception,  some lowly thug with a blade perhaps, but not the umbrella twirling long nosed Penguin himself.  Dr. Vil swallowed, trying to dislodge the lump that had magically appeared in his throat. 

Even less expected was that the Penguin hadn't come in to rob him blind, quite the contrary Penguin had merely wanted some medical advice. Edward Vil quickly came to learn that although the crime boss wasn't exactly the nicest person on the outside he cared very deeply for his family and friends and was actually quite squishy on the inside.  He was so nice about it all that Dr. Vil started making house calls and quite quickly made it on to the Penguin's Christmas party list. 

Things exploded pretty quickly from that point on. Mr. Freeze with a fever that stopped him from being so chill. The Joker who had laughed so hard he had actually bruised a rib. Poison Ivy who had an issue with termites and he had recommended a botanist, he after all didn't have much knowledge of plants. The Riddler even once came in with after fractured wrist after a particularly brutal battle with the Batman. Dr. Edward Vil quickly learned that the villains of Gotham weren't really all that bad. 

His new found friendship with the villains had consequences of course, concequences that weren't at all helped by his practitioners being called E. Vil's Doctors. A few months after opening he had first encountered the Bat of Gotham.

 It had been a dark and stormy night, thunder crashing and lightning flashing as he drank a glass of whiskey in his office at home. He never found out exactly how but, after going to the toilet, there he was in his full black garb and cloak flapping in the wind. By this point Edward Vil was no longer easily surprised and with the amount of attention he had been getting with the bad of Gotham he knew it would only be a matter of time before the good showed up to see what was going on. All he cared about at this point was the wind and the rain flooding in from the open windows.

""You know, the bad guys are always much nicer when the show up for out of hours visits. They don't leave my windows open during storms and they tend to stay out of my house too, Batman I presume?"" The good doctor remarked. 

Batman closed the window before turning and affirming, ""I'm Batman.""

Once again Dr. Vil was surprised. Batman was quite a nice bloke too and before long they were sharing a drink and some embarrassing stories about the caped crusaders villains. 

It went on like this until Edward Vil retired. Patching up the wounds of both sides when things got and bit too rough and staying immune to the bad guys plans when they tried to take over the city. 

Every villain and hero attended his funeral when he died, Batman even cried on the Jokers shoulder.

[WP] Something incredibly mundane happens,Dundeenotdale,"Sales and marketing finally finished the drafts of the solicitation which took them six months to crank out. Piles of insurance applications and letters towered a foot high across cubicle desks and filing cabinets throughout the office. The final tally was approximately ten thousand pieces of mail that were to be stuffed with one application, one letter, one authorization form, one business return envelope and a brochure- all neatly folded and secured in a nine inch, white window envelope.

The process is painfully slow and as you grip each new piece of paper, still holding its warmth from being churned out of the printer your mind wanders. It’s not enough to spark much more than a passing thought, like a grocery checklist or a small list of household chores. There is no rhythm to the shuffle of papers, so as you finally feel your eyes glaze over, your desk-mate asks you to hand him another bundle of brochures. Your fingers are as a dry as the paper they handle and you long to get up from your ten year old chair, with its bumps and stubby wheel. Steal yourself to the bathroom and run your face and cracked palms under a warm faucet to wash some new life into them. 

But inevitably, you have to return to the same dark burrow that is your shared office space. The stale scent of coffee breath trapped in the one window room, the body heat of all four of us thickening the space creating a warm fog with pockets of ozone from the printer. A glance at the clock reads 2:24- still another two hours and thirty six minutes to go until I can push away from my desk. By the time the sun has moseyed across the train tracks, no light reaches the office and a gray hue is cast on to the already egg colored walls and reprints of Monet portraits. The dim glow of the computer screen casts a sullen glare over the four of us in the room, each taking slight pauses to sip lukewarm coffee or tea- occasionally pausing to dryly respond that yes we will attend the meeting about kitchen cleanliness tomorrow from eleven thirty to twelve.

Outside, a train hums past and the whistle cuts through the flitter of papers. For just a few seconds we all glance up from our desks and paper mounds to glance around.

""I thought they rail workers went on strike?""  Max asked. Tilting his dirty blonde head, he stretched back his lanky body to gaze out the window to the bank parking lot beneath.

""No, no they reached a settlement.""  Karen sighed as she said it. Her husband used to work for the rail company and has since retired. Her frizzy brown hair is beginning to fade and her roots are growing in gray.

""Oh."" Max returned to his pile and with a crack of his fingers returned to work, folding, stuffing and stacking. It is a disproportionately draining task.

Sunlight streamed through the windows in the kitchen, illuminating the dining table where two big bowls of cereal were laid next to a little one.

[WP] Something incredibly mundane happens,Dundeenotdale,"The glass of the window pane felt cold against his forehead as he looked upon the street that lay beneath his loft. His thoughts churned to the beat of the rain against his window and just like the water that gripped that thin pane of glass and slowly slid to the street, he held each thought momentarily only to let them slide away.

He wanted to put his fist through that glass and feel it tear into him. He wanted to plunge that bloodied fist into the rain just outside to watch it wash away all that he held inside himself, the thick red liquid that hid just beneath the surface would dilute and lose substance, just as his life did when weighed against all the others this city held.

The dark room he inhabited would never again illuminate his shape against its walls. Final notice after final notice and no new calls made this certain, no jobs to be had for a has-been. Like the blood he wanted to spill to feel something real, he knew soon he too would be cast out in the rain and made to feel the reality of his situation. Without a roof at least he’d have a final curtain.

His eye was caught by a man holding an umbrella, shuffling through the street and wind. His trench coat was thrown about by the winds persistence as he braced against it and his umbrella was blown through, unable to withstand the pressure of the gust. The man tugged his hat down to cover his face as he picked up his pace and proceeded further into the city.

Soon after her conception, she was buried alive. By who, she will never find out.

Then she was repeatedly shot with beams of electromagnetic radiation from some unknown source over 92 million miles away. To top it off, she was repeatedly soaked with stream after stream of water. But these attacks did not slow her down. In fact, she thrived on them.

Day after day this happened, and day after day she relentlessly reached upward, deliberately digging to escape her earthy prison.

Today, I ran into Jim from high school. Jim and I never got along, but I managed to avoid him in our small town in Iowa pretty well, where our entire grade was probably only 120 people. Of all places though, he now works at the same company in Portland, Oregon. I honestly feel pretty unlucky. At least he isn't in my department.

March 6, 2010

Jim managed to get transferred into my department, which is strange considering his specialty is evaluating company worth, while my department focuses on purchasing assets which we believe will hold value. I can't stand being around him, and he can't stand being around me. We mostly avoid each other, attempting to go to the break room at different times. Today, We took the same breaks twice though. I glared at him, he glared at me. I seriously hope he quits.

March 10, 2010

This is bullshit, the guy who works next to me just quit out of the blue, and Jim's desk was moved directly next to mine. How on earth could this happen? I just submitted a request to my boss to be moved, or put on a different project away from him.

March 11, 2010

Ran into Jim. He just got a membership at the gym I exercise at. This is beyond irritating for me, next thing, he'll move into the empty apartment downstairs.

March 14, 2010

He moved into the apartment downstairs.

March 21, 2010

Jim and I take turns taking breaks so we spend as little time looking at each other as possible. Though my boss just announced that there will be a field project with two members visiting New York to talk with some people about real estate acquisition. With my current luck, it'll be Jim and I.

March 22, 2010

Total. Bullshit.

March 26, 2010

Jim and I are at the airport right now, trying to avoid talking at all with each other. The lady who took our tickets asked if we were a couple heading on a honeymoon. With Jim? I'd rather headbutt a belt sander than spend time with him by my own free will.

March 27, 2010

We arrived at our hotel, which our employer booked one room for us. Ok, I thought, I can just avoid Jim by sleeping in the second bed. Nope. Employer booked a single bed room. I'm going to have to share a bed with this asshole.

March 28, 2010

Today, Jim and I went out to look at the real estate. Much to my surprise, he did the right things, asking serious and thoughtful questions to the agent. Maybe Jim isn't as dull as I thought. Definitely don't want to have anything to do with him outside of work though. We're currently heading out to get some celebration drinks for the good deal that we managed to make.

March 29, 2010

I'm horrified with myself. I woke up completely naked next to Jim. What was I thinking? He's repulsive! I mean, he's fit, clean, and honestly his body isn't too bad... but he's JIM. Christ, even he looked surprised when he woke up. He shot me a glance of disgust. I saw him smile a little when I looked away.

May 2, 2010

I can't believe I agreed to go on a date with Jim. Ever since New York, we've sort of been ok with each other, but when he asked me at the office today if I wanted to grab some drinks, I almost choked on the water I was drinking. I don't like him still, why did I agree?

September 3, 2010

I'm such an idiot. I'm currently holding a ring in my possession for Jim. I don't know how to say it, but I feel like I hate Jim so much that I just want to spend the rest of my life with him. We both sneer at each other, we bitch about each other to our co-workers, and we always argue about who takes up more space in our two floor apartment. It's like we're husband and wife.

We dragged the handcuffed woman into the back of the truck as she screamed.

""Fate, where are you taking me?  And why?""

""It's a surprise for your birthday, so just shut up and enjoy it.""

Fate led me into an underused storage closet.  Half-obscured by boxes was a table with a candle and food on it-very delicious-looking food.  I stepped forward excitedly.  I hadn't eaten all day.  Suddenly I could see around the boxes.  There she was, sitting on the other side of the table... That Jew again.  I turned to leave, but Fate was already out and closing the door behind him. *click*.  We were locked in.

""Fate, let me out of here!"" I shouted.

""I will in the morning,"" he laughed, ""and there's a mattress in the corner.  Have fun!""

That asshole.

My stomach growled as I smelled the food.  I guess I could at least eat.

I sat down.  The woman hadn't moved since I walked in, her eyes still staring straight into her lap despite there being more food in front of her than she had eaten in the past two weeks combined.

""I'm Frank,"" I said.  I don't know why.

She looked up hesitantly.  ""Sarah,"" she replied with a forced, but still appealing, smile.  

I paused for a moment to study her.  Long brown curls, greasy from being unable to wash, framed her soft, dirt-covered face.  I dipped my napkin in my water and reached out.  She instantly recoiled.

""It's okay, I'm not going to hurt you.""  She seemed to believe me.  I wiped the dirt from her face and she gave me a tentative smile-less forced and even more beautiful.

""Eat.  I know you're hungry.""  She didn't need any convincing.  She quickly began to cut the chicken, her body desperate for the protein.  I don't know how Fate managed to get chicken, but I wasn't going to question it.  I began to eat as well.  It was the best thing I had eaten in months.

""You're a physicist, right?""

She nodded.

""What are you working on?""

""Staying alive.""

""What were you working on before?""

""Nothing you'd understand.""

""Fine.  I'll tell you what I was doing before the war.  I was working on stabilizing fission reactions to be harnessed for energy.""  She perked up in shock.

"[WP] Fate keeps trying to push a couple together. Unfortunately, they hate each other.",Luna_LoveWell,"Get this one. A year ago I was in my apartment packing. I was moving out of my starter apartment, the one I’d moved into out of college, as part of a plan to upgrade to a building with basic appliances and a doorman to sign for all my packages. It was hot and I didn’t want to keep my A/C on because I had the apartment door open. I was half packed and needed a break so I grabbed a beer from the fridge and sat on the couch (which, unrelated, I’d end up leaving at the apartment since I bought a new (upgrade) couch for my new place). I’m drinking and I suddenly think of this memory of Ashley, my college girlfriend, coming into my college bedroom, walking up to me sitting on the couch, and punching me in the testicles. I almost dropped my beer because it felt like I’d been slapped again—I couldn’t even believe I forgot this in the first place. It was incredibly traumatic. For months it was all I could talk about. I conferred with friends about why Ashley, this girl I had dated off and on since freshman year in college, would suddenly come to me during a quiet time, make a fist and just rifle me right in the cock and the baby makers. 

The weird thing is, drinking the beer, I remembered all the specifics. It was spring when she did it. It was our senior year of college. We had just returned from an all class grad trip to South Carolina. I remember she yelled at me because I’d made too-long eye contact with a sorority sister of hers. But I apologized and she drank vodka and Sprite from a red solo. I was sitting on the black leather couch in my fraternity house bedroom. The carpet was sticky from spilled beer and spelled like yogurt about to turn. My roommate had an incredible stereo system, and I was listening to System of a Down. I was the only person in the bedroom and, seemingly, the house. Ashley came into the room without knocking, said nothing, walked over to me, looked at me with kind of an impish grin. Her hair was in tangled knots and she was wearing an 80s outfit (it was a spirit week). Then I looked at her and said, “What’s up?” That’s when she leaned over, her body totally squared with mine, and knocked the wind out of me. I could have sworn my vas deferens were completely detached. And while I was keeled over she lifted up her white t-shirt—the bottom of which she had in a tie and neon letters were hand drawn all over the front—and then her sports bra. Her 22 year old, completely tanned tits plopped out, one-two, like those tomatoes they have falling in a Burger King or McDonald’s commercial. I remember I was thinking that I would never breath again and those tits took up my entire view. The nipples were like pacifiers and were the color of chewed bubble gum. My eyes must have expanded looking at them, but I was choking from my balls hurting so much and my dick was oddly conflicted with her tits just being right in my face. Then she took one of my hands from my crotch and put it between her boobs and made me, I dunno, cup them, I guess. That’s when she said, “Enjoy your last of these.” Then she left me. 

Now what bothers me is that it feels like I hadn’t thought about that memory in years. I put my beer down and walked around the apartment. I was in a haze because I was trying to remember what I did even after Ashley left that day. I determined that I collected my breath. It didn’t feel like my stomach had fallen out anymore. It’s possible that the event was so traumatic that my brain, without conscious help, shut it out completely. I realized that this memory book ended a period where I hadn’t gotten laid and had been on a few bad dates. So what I had been doing was coming back to my apartment each night, opening up Facebook and Instagram, and looking at the pictures Ashley had up. I never wanted to actually text her or call her. That was a different level. But it was nice, simply, to look at her pictures and remember that I’d seen her naked and had been in her (if I counted the number of times, which I tried once when I was bored, it would have been maybe a hundred or two hundred). But, little by little, I thought that the timing of this memory couldn’t be a coincidence. My brain was, I realized, looking out for me. And he was excavating the recollection and its accompanying emotional and physical trauma and holding it out like a bro fist. The point was that I was supposed to react in kind. Go through all the memory and realize it was an immunization, an Ashley repellent. And here’s the thing—it worked. While I walked around I could actually feel my balls tingling the way a broken bone might before it rains. Then I promised, with absolutely no fucking room for reneging, that I would never—underscore double repeat bold—never think of Ashley going down on me or having sex with me or being some girl I’d ever want to have her head on my shoulder while I watched Netflix, all because she was the one that tried to attack my cock. 

I finally came down from the Ashley thing. The moving van called me and told me that it was parked outside and asked whether all my stuff was ready to be loaded. Yes, I said, even though it wasn't. I can continue packing while they're loading, I imagined, and that is what happened. And on the way cross town to my new apartment I’m sitting in between two guys from Jersey. One guy smelled like coffee and vodka and his name was Tito. The other was chewing gum so ferociously that I thought it's changing the pressure in the cab. We arrived at the building. It’s in a nice-ish part of town. It seemed strange though, because it was the first of the month so there were other moving vans, and it’s obvious that everyone there was in the same life trajectory as me and had the same thought processes. They’re all my age and dressed in gym shorts and nike sneakers and many of them wore shirts from their alma maters. It felt like I was still in college is what I’m saying; that first day when all the parents are wheeling those big, yellow (or green or red, or whatever color they were at your school) bins that are filled with co-ed stuff into dorm rooms. And there’s a relative of the collegial festive atmosphere at the new building, but it’s more downplayed, a bit more serious. The super was there. He’s Arab and very stern, directing movers and meting out time allotments to use the freight elevator. I remember as a college student the ripe possibility that came with moving each year. A new set of neighbors, a new plethora of girls you’d have access to. Some of that was still there, but there was more a drudgery aspect to it. Needing to pay for the sweating Jersey movers could have been part of it. I was past the point where “good will moving” on the part of friends was something you could depend on. 

When I was all moved in I closed my door and turned on the A/C. I remember I seemed lost in all the boxes that were stacked around me and for the time being I had no place to sit except my bed since my couch was on delivery and would be showing up (for the doorman to sign for) within the next day or two. I opened the refrigerator for a beer. I remembered I was new, so I went across the street for a six pack. Back at my door, groping in my pocket for keys, the elevator down the hall chimed. A girl came out. Decent height for a girl and her skin was very tan. She walked down the hall, likewise fumbling for a key. She looked up and it felt like a coin clattered in my stomach because it was Ashley. She said, “Oh my god!” and gave me a hug, and her chest pressed up against me hard, like she thought she could iron the wrinkles out of my shirt. She pulled back. “How are you? I was just thinking about you!” She said, one hand out and her eyes going up and down on me. “You look good!”

“Thanks!” I said, “And you know, I have to admit, I was just thinking about you earlier today. Do you remember that time you punched me in the testicles?” 

She was super chipper before I said this. And then she gives me this look. It was a look of complete perplexity. Then she leans against the hallway wall, lets the plaster do all her body holding for her. She wrinkles her face and looks up into the ceiling light. She puts her fingers under her chin. She was actually thinking about this. But she doesn’t seem pissed off at all. It’s like she’s an open-minded politician and she has never, honest to god, considered *that* as a memory that someone would willingly keep in their head. “No!” She says, being all chipper again, “I haven’t the slightest recollection. That’s so weird! Did that really happen? Oh my God I’m so sorry, like what an absolutely bitchy thing to do, right?”

I looked at her for a long while. She tilted her head and played with her hair. I saw that she wore a navy t-shirt with a loose crew neck. I made a face to show that maybe I had just made a joke and it landed weird. Then I said, “Maybe I’m crazy! It’s so good to see you!” And we both laughed.

Unless there's some way to canonize the timeline through an extra-temporal record, what's to stop anyone from anything? 

In case a change were to be made that would interfere with the traveller's ability to be present, they would probably start getting a spider sense to indicate that time is pushing back, stopping him from making a change. ",catholicauthor

"[WP] Once time machines become possible, historians are required to go back and get photographic or video evidence in order to be taken seriously.",Mutant_Llama1,"The job of a Historian had changed drastically over the course of 50 years ever since humanity had discovered time travel. Since time machines became a possibility, historians now were required to go back and gather photographic or video evidence of historical events in order to be considered 'credible'. Once dominated by the elderly population, historians were now bright and eager 20 year olds with a knack for adventure. This occupation however did not last long for the majority of them due to its precarious conditions. The job of being a Historical Journalist punches you in the face...hard. No man or woman was ever the same after their first contract. There is a reason why the dropout rate is 64% after the first job is signed. Some never returned from their time traveling ventures, but most of the time they returned with an incomplete assignment covered in blood from head to toe. The stories that the survivors had told would turn anybody’s stomach inside-out.


One boy of 23 had surprisingly gotten back to tell the tale of a lifetime. He should not have survived. Almost every bone in his body was broken, his face was unrecognizable having had his flesh removed and teeth pulled…one by one. His legs were stumps of flesh gushing thick crimson blood and his hands had stubs where his fingers used to be. His task had been to film a secluded and uncharacteristically barbaric tribe in southern Brazil. The rest of the story is best left to the imagination for the gruesome details of cannibalistic torture would make anybody develop PTSD.


After this particular incident the Bureau of Historical Time Travel had taken matters into their own hands. Much like the modern day CIA and FBI, rigorous tests and background checks would be in order. Physical and mental examinations were in place, as well as a psyche evaluation (mainly for coping purposes). The rules were drilled into every single participant like it depended on their life.


Rule Number 1: You are never to alter historical events. Ever.


Rule Number 2: You must never be seen. Blending in is purely for a last resort escape.


Rule Number 3: Recreational Time Travel is strictly prohibited. 


Rule Number 4: Breaking rule number 1 is punishable by death.


The golden rules of a Historical Journalist were plain, yet simple. Changing any historical event will change the present and the whole world as we know it. The breaking of the rules would place the human race into mortal peril. Think of it as a butterfly effect through time. If one event is altered then thousands of choices that were made throughout time because of that event would be reformed. The choices would not be the same. The world would not be the same.


Daren Wilkoff was one of these Historical Journalists.


Daren had been a Historical Journalist since the department had opened. He started at 18, fresh out of high school with a tough guy attitude. He was compact and agile, thin and surprisingly strong for his size. He stopped growing at 19 standing at an unimpressive 173cm. Compared to a lot of the other candidates signing up for their first contracts, he stood a head shorter. Their cheeky grins and false confidence did not last long in the ferocious world they were about to enter. Nobody could ever really be ready.


Daren’s first assignment had been to document the construction of the Egyptian pyramids. This had gone well considering the fact that they were so big and the camera that Daren had could zoom for miles and still capture 4k photos. They were however only given a pistol and one camera on their adventures through time which would prove slightly less than enough for the average journalist.",NeverAgainDave

After a nasty divorce and thanks to a terrible attorney, Jim is left with only an old hiking staff that hasn't been used since Boy Scout days, and a knight costume he wore for Halloween 20 years ago, which he is wearing since he didn't get any of his clothes in the divorce. 
Oh yeah, and his five year old daughter named Lacey. He gives the hiking staff to his daughter and puts her on his shoulders, ""We're going on an adventure princess!"". Lacey doesn't say anything, she hasn't said a word since Jim and Candice started fighting. They walk a few blocks over to Jim's co workers house. All the lights are off. He sets Lacey down and pounds on the door. 
The lights come on and Brandon opens the door. He looks groggy. ""Seriously Jim? It's not Halloween for another 3 days, what are you doing here?"" Jim looks at his daughter and then back at Brandon.
 ""Listen, just let us stay over tonight."" Brandon sighs and motions for them to come in. He gets some blankets and pillows and takes Lacey to the guest bedroom. 
Both of the men head into the kitchen and Brandon takes out two glasses and a  bottle of honey whiskey. 
""What the hell is going on Jim?"" Brandon asks as he pours a glass. 
Brandon takes it and sighs, ""I lost it all today in the divorce"". 
Brandon looks at Jim with disbelief, ""Everything? Your house? Your clothes? Your-"" 
""YES. Everything. Would I be wearing this damn knight costume if I didn't? I don't know what I'm supposed to do Jim. I've got like $132 in my wallet and that's it. I won custody over the kid and nothing else. What the hell am I going to do?"" He finishes his drink and turns toward the guest bedroom, he stares for a moment. ""What am I going to do with Lacey?"" 
Brandon puts a hand on Jim's shoulder. ""Well, you're going to work your ass off and get things figured out man. That's what we do. You've got to be her knight in.. Not very shiny armor. I'd tell you that in the mean time you can stay here, but you can't."" Brandon takes his hand off his should and walks toward the stairs. ""I don't like guests, be out by the time I wake up.""

""You don't have to go."" He said. Ashan loved me, but he didn't know. He couldn't know. Not yet, hopefully not ever. 
""You're right. I don't have to. I want to save some of them. That's something I have to do.""
He looked at me, tears streaming down his face. ""I know. But you can't blame a guy for trying."" He said as he smiled through the tears.
I hugged him, trying to convey all my love, and give him a last little bit of the warmth I was taking away with me.
""Say goodbye to Jeremy.""
That was it. He knew me so well. The chink in my armor. The only way to my heart.
""Ashan..."" Four little words. More power than a thousand armies, and four little words rocked me to the core. Four. Little. Words.
He smiles. He knows he's won. ""You're his father. You must.""
I plod down the hall. This is what he wanted from the beginning. He knew I would... that this was his only chance to...
I knock on his door.
""Hey, champ.""
Jeremy looks up at me, and his eyes instantly blaze with a supernova's worth of joy. He hops up from his comic books, the ones my dad gave him, and cannonballs into my legs in a hug.
""Hey Dad!!!"" He bubbles, turning his face up to me
""How's the reading going?""
""Awesome! I didn't know Grampa Dave was so cool!"" He exclaims.
""Yeah?""
""Oh, ABSOLUTELY!!! He has so much cool stuff! And Gramma Jeannie is a really good cook."" He starts rambling about my Mom's glorious cooking.
""Jeremy...""
He looks up, as I cut him off, head cocked to the side. He's a precocious kid, and he'll be a hellion as a teenager, if Ashan isn't...
He cuts into my thoughts. 
""What's up, dad?""
I kneel down to his level.
""I... I'm... I have to go out to...""
He tilts his head the other way, waiting, confused, but trusting.
I sigh. 
""I'm have to leave, to try and stop some bad things and some bad people from hurting a lot of people.""
""Oh... so you're a superhero?""
""I... what?"" My heart catches in my throat.
""In the comics, from Grandpa, they have these people whose job it is to save in-in- in...""
""Innocent?""
""Yeah! Inn-o-cent people from vill Ians. They're bad people. But not like Uncle Ian, he's a good guy.""
I choked down a sob. He looked closely at me.
""Are you gonna save people there?"" He asked.
""Yes. As many as I can.""
He turned and dashed to the stacks of comics, sorting through them carefully. He pulled one out, put it in a little envelope of protective material, and dashed back over. Just as he put it carefully into my hands, I felt a hand hit my shoulder and heard:
""Come on, Boss. We gotta go NOW if we want to beat the Kremish basta-""
""Hey Aunt Kerri!"" Jeremy chirrups, cutting her cursing off before either of us register. Which is good, because she knows she's not supposed to use that language here.
""Heya kiddo! What's going on with ya?""
""Just reading comics! Dad said you have to go save some people. Are you going with him?""
Kerri raises an eyebrow at me, and I shuffle my feet slightly. She throws her head back laughing her brass bell peal of a laugh.
""I reckon it is, Super J. D'ya want anything cool from where we go?""
Jeremy scrunches his face up, thinking. He goes back over to his comics, and picks one up. 
""If you see something like this, I think it'd be super cool to hang up in my room.""
Kerri pads over to him, liquid deadly grace, and peers at what he's pointing at. I see the muscles in her neck bunch as she stiffens with surprise. I'm still frozen, kneeling on the floor. She looks up at me, keeping her voice unchanged.
""I reckon we might be able to find something like that. Might not be exactly the same, though."" She says.
Jeremy is blissfully unaware. ""Well yeah, that's be tough. This stuff is like... two hundred years old, right? Probably all these Flags are gone, right? Well, be good and save people and stuff!""
He runs over and hugs me, then hugs her.
""Bye Dad! Bye Aunt Kerri! See you soon!""

It's not until I'm heading into the cockpit that Kerri hands me the plastic coated comic. I had forgotten Jeremy gave it to me, too many last minute details.
""Some light reading before we go?""
I turn the comic over in my hand and read the cover.
""Earth's Mightiest Heroes Save America!"" It said in big bold letters.
A small fire burst to life in my chest. It expanded, building in a fiery crescendo that roared through me. I stepped into my cockpit, closed to hatch, and keyed my comms.
""This is my fight. Everyone else stays. End of discussion. Clear out now.""
There were some surprised exclamations; some: ""hey boss, that's crazy!"", some: ""boss, that's suicide!""
Kerri knew. May be she hadn't seen me do this in a very, very long time. She cleared them all out. Battlemom to the max. Maybe she'd try to kick my ass after this. Good. Bout time I had another kid.

My suit powered on, and I dropped from the ship, heading toward the atmosphere. Hostile aliens invading; proud and glorious civilizations crumbling; a planet under siege; ten billion to one odds. 

There's an old American Republic have a saying they stole from the comics: ""with great power comes great responsibility."" What they forgot was the other part: ""with great responsibility come greater power.""

My son told me I'm a super hero, asked me to save as many as I can, and all he wants is a flag that used to represent freedom, standing up for what's right, and fighting tyranny.

Fragmented hosts of people shambled the streets, lost, demented twisted aberrations without sense nor soul. Words had lost their meaning, they were no longer said nor heard, for all sanity enough to speak had long since passed.

Jacob had once been a man of knowledge. Archiving those once great and wondrous words. It had been his science, a love of words had been his soul.

Now, he shambled the halls of a crumbling and shadowed library, his soul clinging to his purpose, but his mind lost to the void.

Through the long night, he festered through the whispering dark, carrying stacks of rotted knowledge from shelf to shelf. Never ceasing but for a moment... Until he held a curious book in his clawed and dusted grip.

His pale eyes staring at the cracked spine, fine gold lettering pierced the hollow darkness ""THE CALL OF CTHULU"". The faded pages slowly whispering ancient words through the matted leather cover.

As quickly as it was held, back again it was placed. And shuffled hence Jacob's crippled form, away again into the darkness of the library.

"[WP] Every librarian is trembling in fear as they move Lovecraft to ""non-fiction"".",RastaMcDouble,"“Excuse me, Margaret, can I come in?” Anna stood at the edge of her boss’s door. The lights were dimmed and papers were strewn about everywhere. A wrinkled hand beckoned her forward from behind a pile of books.

“Maggie, we’re all… concerned about your most recent decisions. Lovecraft books to nonfiction? H.G. Wells books to reference? And no matter how much we might have political disagreements, I don’t think claiming every presidential biography is fiction will make a lot of our patrons happy. We have librarians literally shaking in fear out there as they rearrange the bookshelves.”

Red-shot eyes stared back at Anna. In the last few days, Margaret looked even older than her seventy-seven years. “I’ve made my decisions,” she said hoarsely. “I run this library and I know that this is… right.” Margaret had started her sentence with confidence, but she started to lose her edge. She seemed to sink behind the teetering stack of books on her desk.

“The county manages this library, ma’am. How do you think these decisions will look in the news? We’ll be the laughing stock of the state. We’re already trying to get by on barely enough funds,” Anna stepped forward and saw Margaret's haggard look in the dim light. She immediately regretted her sternness. How does one tell her lifelong friend that it’s time to end their life’s work? Margaret never had a family, never even had a hobby that Anna knew about besides reading and maintaining a small county library.

Anna pulled up a chair around the side of the desk and sat down next to her boss. For some reason, the area around the desk felt much colder than the rest of the room, but Anna dismissed it to herself that she was trying to find excuses to not say what she had to say. She gently grabbed Margaret's hand. “Maggie, we’ve worked together for 30 years. I know this library is your life. Don’t end it this way. Please.”

The tears Margaret had been holding back finally came. “It’s all real, Anna, it is… I’ve seen things, unseen words in the margins… It’s all real…” She shook back and forth as she cried. Anna let her head fall gently onto her shoulder. “Please,” Anna whispered. “Please tell everyone outside that this was just a joke. Please tell them to put the books back where they belong.” Margaret mechanically nodded; Anna thought she looked broken, but Margaret’s willingness to remand her nonsense orders had to be seized while she was thinking straight. Oh, how the mind goes, Anna thought wearily.  Anna silently handed her friend  tissues and helped her to her feet. “Let’s go, all the librarians are waiting outside,” she said. 

As they walked out of Margaret’s office -- for Margaret’s last time  -- Anna thought she saw a book in the middle of the room let off a faint glow, but she quickly dismissed it as a flicker of the light.",CoffeePassport

[WP] Every one is assigned a number which determines their threat to humanity. You are number 2.,Sir_Faultzone,"“You’re fucking wrong!” he yells louder than I’ve ever heard him yell before.
With a fast wave of his hand my dad sends the thick packet of papers flying into the air where they rain everywhere around the room and on the heads of the white-coats crowded around us.

Standing there, in a glass room in some government psychiatric hospital, watching the crazy man yell at the top of his lungs, you can’t help but think that maybe, aside from him belonging there, that my current medical condition owes it a little bit to genetics.

But then imagine it—you spend fifteen years of your life giving up on your dreams, waking up early and going to bed late, making sure that you are raising a productive member of society only to learn one day that somewhere along the way you fucked up and you’ve raised another Bin Laden.

Well okay they actually didn’t say that.

“Just because your son is number two on the scale doesn’t mean that he’ll turn out that way,” they explain in vain. What the man with the Stalin mustache means to say is, ‘we won’t let that happen, because he’s not leaving here.’

My dad has been in a rage ever since Mrs. Everman, my school counselor, contacted the Department of Health and Human Services as directed, after my psychiatric evaluation came back with a very negative score. All my friends scored high on it, but for some reason unknown to me, this mandatory test that the government makes all fifteen year-olds take came back sending red flags all through the system with me. “Unsual abnormal behavior,” they said. Okay yeah, I punched a kid once in recess, but you tell me, is that really that rare among kids?

Anyways, ever since then I’ve been going from hospital to hospital being treated like a lab rat only to land here, at the prestigious Johns Hopkins where after a week of behavioral tests, aptitude tests, pretty much everything down to biological tests—hell they even check family history as far as they can—these geniuses have determined that I rank number two on the Aus-Mays Scale, some international psychiatric index that measures your threat to humanity.

I honestly don’t care much about it and believe it to be a little bullshit, but I must admit that being the most ordinarily boring person I know, hearing that I’m at least different for something gave me a little rush. Yeah it’s obviously not the “something” I would’ve wished for myself, but it is something.

I don’t feel any different than I felt the day before or the day before that. I don’t have any “homicidal tendencies” or anything like that, but according to them their scale is good enough to predict very abnormal behavior. And in 34 previous cases their picks have turned out to become the most fucked up human beings ever to live. I believe one of them actually, their number one pick, the person just ahead of me, is at this very moment on the FBI’s Most Wanted list and is the perpetrator of several acts of international terrorism that has left countless dead. He was once a student just like me. 

It was because of people like him that several psychiatrists pressured UN heads of state to adopt the test that would eventually become standard in 150 countries around the world.

Right now this guy is being hunted for being an evil motherfucker. I just play video games in my off time.

After my dad goes on his little diatribe about how they need to calibrate their methods or whatever, a lady breaks away from the group and walks over to me. She asks if she can have a private conversation in another room which I agree to and my dad readily forbids.

She explains to him that machines and tests do their thing but that only a one-on-one with someone can tell you about who they are as a person. He swallows it and lets me go. I don’t mind only because whatever she has to say will satisfy my curiosity about just how much of a plague I’m supposed to be upon humanity.

The lady walks over to the door and tells my dad that we’ll be back in an hour or so. I can tell that it’s not going to happen that way, and I think my dad knows it too because he gives me a distant and pained stare, packed with as much emotion as the one I imagine he gave me when he held me in his arms for the first time. He pulls me close to him and hugs me tight. What choice does he have, he’s surrounded by doctors who know more than he ever will, and in any case, given my condition it’s guaranteed that he’ll be served with a court order to force his hand—but now, hugging my dad I wonder if these men with all their knowledge and their degrees and their scales know what a hug like this feels like.
I tell my dad that I’ll be back soon and let myself be shepherded into the hall by the psychiatrist lady.

“I’m Susan…” she extends a warm hand, which I politely shake. “But please call me Suzy… I hate Susan.”

I shake her hand firmly just like my dad taught me and she compliments me for it. We walk down this long hallway where the walls take on this soothing cream color. I have no idea where we’re going but I don’t really care. My dad and his yelling and his broken heart are already miles away in my mind.

“So Kodak—unusual name…” she says and I nod without saying anything.
She continues as she leads me through what seems like an endless road, “tell me what is it that you want to be in a few years?”

“Why?” I ask dubious of her intentions.

“There’s a chance this thing might be wrong—we’ve been wrong before,” she lies. “…and according to your file you’re obviously a very intelligent young man. Well above average in nearly all academic scales… maybe we can help you get where you’re going.”

I hesitate but I tell her anyways only because whomever these people are don’t actually want me to become a serial murderer, so in the interest of world peace if they can diagnose my condition maybe they can fix it too.

“Well…” we keep walking. I turn back and I notice that for some time now we’re being followed by three guys who look like feds with their all-black suits and rubber faces but I pay no attention since wherever it is we’re going is not prison or some torture chamber.

“Well, this might seem a bit unrealistic to you,” I say a little embarrassed. “But I’m really interested in politics… I think that maybe one day if I turn out to be normal after all I’d like to become president of the United States, maybe…”
She smiles a peculiar smile that makes me uncomfortable.

“Maybe…” she says as she opens the door that crosses over into another hallway. “Maybe.”

Seven years... and eternity she's been gone--stolen--from my life. She approached us in the field and kept eye contact with me with every step, as I did with her.

We had gathered in the middle of a large farm where all of these missing persons were gathered. Droves of friends and family had come out to find their loved ones just as Marie and I had found Casey. We stopped, standing in front of each other.

""Casey,"" I said, hoping to confirm this as reality and not just another fleeting dream.

""Father,"" she said smiling. She turned to Marie. ""Mother.""

""Yes, honey,"" Marie said as we reached out to hug her. She recoiled and took a step back. We hesitated, and gave a quick worried glance at one another.

""What..."" Marie hesitated, ""what happened to you? Do you know who took you? Or why you're here?""

Casey nodded, a short nod, opening her mouth to respond, she was cut off by the cries of a little boy who was flailing in the arms of his mother. She looked at him wistfully, then focused back on us.

""We were told that we would be picked up right here.""

""By who?"" Marie asked.

Casey wrung her hands together. 

""We can talk about it once you get settled in back home, if you want,"" I said, allowing for her to either confirm or deny my fears.

""I'm not going back,"" she said, dejectedly.

""Wha--"" Marie began, but I cut her off with my hand on her shoulder, knowing that she might fall into hysterics.

""Why wouldn't you want to come home, sweetie?"" I asked, cautiously.

""It's not my home. It's yours. I haven't been there in years.""

""We can get a new one--"" Marie began, but broke as her voice cracked.

""Where would you rather stay?"" I continued, keeping my facade of patience, despite my frustration.

""Back at the factory. The milk is very good,"" she scratched at her wrists.

""Which factory, sweetie?""

""The milk factory. They fill cartons of milk there,"" she looked like she was about to start salivating.

""Do... do you want milk right now?""

""Do you have any!?"" she lost all of her composure in that instant, almost reaching for me.

I looked at her, just as she looked at me. As a stranger. They had her addicted to milk? How is that even possible?

""Honey, I can give you all the milk you want when we get home.""

I saw a child in my peripheral vision sprinting to the middle of the field, away from his parents.

""How many lost children are there in town?"" Casey asked.

""What? I don't know. A couple, I think.""

""Are there cartons with the pictures at stores?""

""What pictures?""

""With the words on top! They have the words then the picture!"" she was agitated, uncomfortable with the questions.

""What do the words say?""

She shut her eyes and grabbed her head in frustration.

""I don't know! I can't read them!""

Marie broke into hysterical crying now, joining a chorus of other wailing families around us. She couldn't even read. Then I knew what she was talking about and somehow more questions were opened instead of answers. My mind flashed to the last picture we had of Casey. Her smile was huge, despite missing a few teeth and her eyes shined with happiness. But on top of it were four words.

"[WP] A demon possesses a little girl, but inside her it finds something...worse.",TheOneSaneGuy,"Melissa didn't like the dark. ""Mummy, there's monsters,"" she'd say over and over, before her mother gave in and left the night-light switched on. The light, she had decided, protected her from the creatures that lurked around, like running a ring of salt around your house might do. If only it was that simple.

It came out of the dark hallway and smiled. ""She waits with light to guide me home,"" it said, its teeth piercing out of its dark form. You could say that it glided more than walked, and, as it reached the side of the bed, it clicked its non-corporeal fingers and the light went out. ""We'll sleep easy now,"" it said, nestling itself inside her body. 

In the morning it woke, the girl's mother praised her for switching her night-light off, commenting that she was growing up. The demon accepted this praise and looked at itself in the mirror: she was a pretty young thing, with blonde hair that was just long enough to remind it of a character that used to host the parasitic creature before she expired. It went to pick up the toothbrush and stopped, a sudden pain bellowing through the girl's body. It checked up on itself: her pyjama bottoms had become sodden in blood. It called the girl's mother, who talked something about an ""Aunt Flo coming to visit,"" which the demon didn't understand: ""Mummy, what is happening to me?!!!""",Kennethclayden

I had been following her for several days, to make sure that she was a worthy target for conversion. I had no inkling of anything other than beauty and freshness. She was like a flower, a bulb just on the cusp of opening when hit with new sun.

I dove into her, like any other charge, and found a pool of darkness unlike any I had ever seen. 

She trapped me, her darkness enveloped my spirit and consumed it. Locking me down with her deceptive depths, I was privy to the subconscious plan. She intended to keep up this facade of innocence to trap more demons, to lure us in, and feed her inner evil. For she was the supreme evil, but a good movement needs bodies.

Perfectly ordinary. Slightly more useful than a dog. It has hands.

""Fine""

Child rolls under the surface, vicious full of hatred. Child can't move. Child wants to.

It wants to smash itself against the walls and scream. It wants to tear its fingernails off with its blunt teeth. It wants to scratch its skin to reveal the red flesh beneath.

Alien. Wrong. Horrible. It fights and clings. Angry. It is always angry.

Why? Why?

Why seek pain? Here is good. Here is quiet. Don't understand.

Why not?

Child responds. Angry. It is angry. Don't understand. 

Can't. A counter.

Perhaps.

Want to move myself. Child is insistent. 

Why?

Child stops. It is confused. It struggles mentally grasping at concept. Thoughts flicker, jump back to back. It assumes can't already see the answer. It is wrong. It tries anyway. why waste energy to do this? Why fight. Not an enemy. Want to live too.

I just want to do things. Child gives up. crestfallen. its head dips. not paying enough attention to control. Best to tighten it.

A day later it tries again. it is just as violent as the last time. why fight. is better here than there.

Please. I want to live.

Is alive. Better here than there.

Let me do something. Child says later. it is less insistent, more helpful now. It still hates, it still fights. Wonder if all humans are like this. Likely not. This one must be damaged.

Do what. done plenty. Gone to park and played with toy and eaten candy. Was nice. Was good.

"[WP] A demon possesses a little girl, but inside her it finds something...worse.",TheOneSaneGuy,"It was a nice Saturday noon. The weather was just the way I liked it; hot and dry. No clouds blocked the sun as it shone upon the park. On an isolated bench sat the cutest little girl; big eyes, puffy cheeks, innocent smile. I just knew I **HAD** to possess her. 

I'm Azazel Jr. and contrary to popular belief, not ALL demons are bad. Don't get me wrong I'm not pretending to be a saint, I'm the bad kind. At least, I am thanks to my father's influence. See my dad is Azazel, you might know him by his more common pseudonym ""Satan"". I grew up under ridiculously high standards, he expects me to rule hell by his side one day. Countless times he has tortured me, his own son mind you, for being ""too soft"" or ""too kind"". I get he's Satan, but you'd THINK he has a soft spot for his kid, but noooo. I bet you can imagine the rest of my heavenly childhood. 

You might be wondering, what's the deal with possessions anyway? what's the *point*? Well, ask different demons and they'd each answer differently. Some do it to corrupt the minds of youth (as they are easier to influence), some do it for fun and some even claim they do it for the greater good, whatever that means. Why did I do it? It was part of a set of trials my bad 'ol dad set up for me. This is only *phase I*.

Flash forward to point where I'm actually inside her. Now, now, pedos... don't get too excited, I meant that in a *supernatural* kind of way. If I were to describe possession to the average human brain, the closest comparison I can think of is when you're a skilled manipulator. Casually and quite easily being able to influence their thoughts and reactions. The actual supernatural process has a few side effects, but non of them are interesting enough to mention.

Explanations aside, now I have successfully possessed her, or so I thought. Upon binding with her soul, I found something dark. Something VERY dark. That amounts greatly when **you're the son of Satan**. An entity so powerful, so evil... **it was the one who corrupted my father from his otherwise angelic history**.

I had to stop the treadmill. It was getting to be too much. My chest expanded and contracted by inches, and I was wheezing.

I pulled out a gym towel and coughed violently. My whole body began to shake and shudder.

When I was done, the towel looked like as if Picasso had repainted Guernica on the towel using only blood.

*Sigh* ""Another innocent girl that needed to be possessed.""

My demonic physician had told me that I was long overdue to possess someone. That if I didn't do it quickly, my body would deteriorate exponentially. 

When I was younger, I had relished in doing these sorts of things. How I stirred so much chaos when I had possessed Abigail Williams at Salem in 1692! But when you grow older, you start taking less pleasure in such base things. I didn't really relish possessing souls now. I'd much rather take a cozy nap with my hellhound.

When I had showed up and used my dark claw to search her heart, I had come upon much more darkness than I had anticipated.

Usually, when a girl has PTSD, it doesn't hurt her that much. Sure, her heart is scarred, but not damaged to this extent.

But for some reason, the heart of this Bosnian girl was so depraved. It was much worse than the cruelest punishments that we had reserved.

I needed to report this to Satan. It is just so horrific, worse than anything we could imagine. And so I went back to hell.",jimmyyang3000

"[WP] A demon possesses a little girl, but inside her it finds something...worse.",TheOneSaneGuy,"I hovered above the child, listening to her sing, and watch her parents smile in awe of their offspring. What an awful expression. Such joy, and pride for another


Yuck.


I looked around for something to scare the bumbling creature and its beaming slaves. Yet they were the only ones at the park this evening.


Awful. Awful.


The parents were too difficult to control, they felt emotions strongly in this moment. So I dived into the mind of the female who fell to the ground, her heart pumping richly to provide blow flow to her newly scraped knees.


Perfect.


The mind was so under-developed, it was easy to seize control. I felt the girl's soul tying to my mind, and I listened closely before I initiated.


The girl didn't panic under my grasp. She softly cooed, enjoying the treacherous terrain under my control. I rolled my eyes, then pick up the girl's physical carrier, slowly bringing her over to parents at a rabbit's pace. 


The large female looked over to me, the smile dropping from her face. She kneeled in front of me, inquisition crosses her face in an instant. The patron joined her, with even more concern.


I attempted to show distraught, hoping that they would take me to their home where I could make a more powerful impact out of the possible view of others. It worked, and the mother grabbed her bag and unlocked the van.

Inside of my head, the girl warms strongly, burning my skin. I shove her deeper into my skin, and I feel her panic, the mindset we shared shaked with emotion. I didn't panic. I subconsciously pushed her away while I planned my seeds of deceit.


The girl reacted strongly, started a form of breathing against my skull. I felt her tugging at our tie, attempting to loosen herself. 


This was my first return to Earth after 8 years. There was no way I was letting this go. Father wanted me here.


The patron picked up the girl's physical figure, and the girl warmed, even stronger this time around. I focused on wrapping my arms around the father, letting loose of my reigns on the girl slightly, so she would know we were close to him. Only to tug them away.


*""...through the sky-""*


A phrase cut through my brain, I looked up, accidentally letting the physical figure react as well. The father patted my head, but inside, I was afraid.


I pulled on the reign I had on the soul a little more, but she laughed. Laughter, one of the most paining things about this job. It brings the most joy.


And the most fear.


She continued to laugh, and my vision flickered. I let the physical figure fall limp as I pulled all of my strength towards the soul. Which was aflame. 


I turned to the girl, when I saw something flash across the mind. It stayed for short amounts of time. In, out, in, out, in, out. The visual was not strong, but a small sound added with each twitch.


I turned away from the girl, commited to finding the source. That was my mistake. 


*""-Climb aboard, get ready...""*


The soul began to rise from my interior, growing in strength. I attempted to reign it in, but the ropes burned against my skin.


*""To explore, zooming through the sky...""*


The static of the visual cleared, revealing a small red-headed cartoon boy with glasses. 

No.


No.


No.


The music blared in my head, crescendoing as the soul sparked against my control. 


*""Little Einsteins.""*


No.


*""There's so much to find.""*


No.


I pressed against the membrane, attempting to escape.


The little girl laughed, beginning the song again.


She had control.


I screeched, completing letting go of her. I floated out to the recesses of the brain, ready to be let through.


*""We're going on a trip, in our favorite rocket ship.""*


I turned around, and the soul formed itself into the form of the little girl. It smirked, its mouth joining in with the song. 


*""Five.""*

No.


*""Four.""*


No.


*""Three.""*


NO.


*""Two.""*


*NO*

"[WP] A demon possesses a little girl, but inside her it finds something...worse.",TheOneSaneGuy,"See, here's the thing. Possessing kids is all fun and games, really, it is! You can twist their heads around full circle to scare the crap out of their parents, or stick them to the ceiling. It's great, family fun.
It's even better when they call in a priest and you can pretend that his exorcism worked, just to return full force with all the good stuff later. And the best part is, that the kid enjoys it!
It's not that I just take over their body, no, I give them control sometimes and see what they do with all the power I give them. That's often when I enjoy it the most, because even I have no idea what's gonna happen.

I had a kid turn himself inside out once just to see what would happen. His dad was concerned. No, I mean all I do is mess with people and make them believe in The Almighty Jesus Christ. Funny thing? He's one of us too.

To be honest, all of this, the jokes and pranks, that's what most of us do. Sure there's some of us who go too far, and actually physically harm people but that's not cool. Most of us aren't like that, and we condemn their actions when they get back.

No, the worst demon I've ever met wasn't one of us. He wasn't from Hell, though he sure does belong in the deepest pit of it. I possessed a kid once, name of Joey. Decent, shy kid. And I myself was quite young and naive as well at this time.
I liked him. At first I just watched. I didn't interfere, I just watched and waited, seeing what this kid does, that sort of thing. He had a crush on this girl, Cindy. Cindy was nice, she would share her cookies with different people each day at break time. The second day I was inhabiting Joey, she shared her cookies with him. Oh, it was such a good feeling for the kid. And I was so, so tempted to roll Joey's eyes to the back of his head and speak in tongues, but I decided not to. Not today.

That same night, Joey went to bed after watching his cartoons. He was afraid, I could tell that much. At first I thought that maybe he was afraid of the dark, but that didn't seem to be it. No. This was much worse than that. 

Joey heard a car door slam outside, and tensed up. He pulled the covers over his head as the front door opened and closed. Footsteps, uneven and shaky lead to Joey's door. I caught glimpses of the monster Joey faced through his memories. Sudden flashes of a face.

The ultimate betrayal, of a father failing his son. He was meant to protect him from the monsters, from the demons. Instead he had become one. Joey's bedroom door opened, and I took over. I spared the child of those memories.

I still check up on him from time to time. His father went missing that night, but you wouldn't be able to guess it from how Joey is now. A few short months and he's the happiest kid I've seen.

It feels good, honestly. That surprised me. I was kind of disappointed that I didn't get to torment anyone. Ah well, there's always next time.",13lack12ose
"[WP] A demon possesses a little girl, but inside her it finds something...worse.",TheOneSaneGuy,"*It's been 10,000 years since I've seen the sunlight. Souls cast into hell are forced to endure 2,000 years of torture before they are promoted to the next rank. The first two ranks are pretty powerless. Ghosts and Ghouls barely have the strength to move objects, and they certainly can't scare humans anymore. A dish flying across the room will only piss humans off. Third ranks are shadow demons. They're pretty scary, but only affect humans in night terrors, or in dark alleyways. They're pretty limited in what they can do. After that, it is small horned demons (which is when you can start possessions), and large horned demons. As a rank 5 large horned demon, I can make a grown man shit his pants if I make myself visible.*

A large red demon emerged from a hole that had just opened up. He scampered into the shade of a tree and peered out towards a group of children playing in a park. A little girl sat on the swings, alone, not more than 5 years old.

*This little girl is perfect. Children are great targets to freak out parents. It's weird that I don't see her parents around here though. They're probably one of the one's sitting on the bench. I should probably get closer so I can possess her.*

The demon crawled toward the little girl.

""What are you doing?"" the little girl asked staring straight at the demon.

*Shit, she can see me. Well, that's not completely unheard of. Sometimes little kids can see the other side when they are younger. I wonder what form she sees me in.*

""Uh nothing. I'm just here to play with you,"" replied the demon.

""Ok.""

*Ok, she's staring off at those kids now. This is my perfect chance for posession.*

The demon gripped the girls throat with his red hands. His body started to shift, as a red gas seem to flow off of him. Something didn't seem right to him.

""The Evil is coming,"" said the little girl.

*Wait, what?*

The red mist disappeared. The demon's eyes opened wide, as black tendrils crawled from the girl's face, snaking their way onto his hand. Her face covered in a shadowy darkness, her eyes now glowed a firey red. What once was a child stood a large shadowy beast, now with horns as large as horses. The red demon's hand, still trapped in the darkness suddenly burst into flame, as he recoiled, clutching a burning stump. Shadowy wings burst from the ethereal creature's back. 

*Well, shit...*

The Beast roared, causing the nearby humans to explode. The smaller demon recoiled from his wounds, back towards the gate to Hell.

_________________________________________________________________

""You idiot,"" said the Devil, as the demon emerged from the gate and collapsed on his knees. ""Do you know what you've done?""

""What level demon was that?"" said the demon.

""That's not on a level! You broke one of the seals! That is one of the beasts, called 'the devourer.' Not even I am going to fuck with that,"" said the Devil.

**And then the Apocalypse happened and everyone died and went to heaven or was raped in hell for all eternity.**

"[WP] A demon possesses a little girl, but inside her it finds something...worse.",TheOneSaneGuy,"I-I just went through hell. I'm not talking about actual Hell, although I have been there and this was much worse.

I've always liked possessing kids. Its fun to listen to their confused thoughts as you cause chaos. *Why am I doing this? Whats going on? I want a juice box!* Classic. It never gets old. Well, It never *got* old.

I was walking down the street and casing out some possible targets when I saw a little girl walking with her mother. They looked like a perfect picture of a family. I, of course, immediately started making plans to change that. I was thinking I was going to go with a 'Daughter kills mother' scenario. I'm not typically one to mess with family relations, but this just seemed way to good to pass up.

Having decided on my plan, I followed the mother and daughter home and waited for them to sit down for dinner. They were having mac and cheese, which I didn't even think constituted a whole meal. When the kid was about halfway done with her food, I possessed her.

What a mistake.

Immediately this kids thoughts pierced my eardrums. She was sing some sort of song or chant in her head, and it was pure torture. The song had something to do with winter, or the cold, or something. It wasn't even winter! I tried to leave the kids body, but the song was too distracting. I couldn't hear myself think let alone go through the steps of un-possessing this child.

Through all of the pain and sorrow brought to me through this kids constant thoughts of music, I had devised a plan to get her to stop. If she uncontrollably lept out of her chair and started stabbing her mother, there was no way she could keep this music up. 

In a fit of rage, I made the child jump over the table at her mother and grab a fork. I then preceded to stab at the mothers throat. 

Instead of crying or trying to regain control, this little son of a bitch **changed songs.**

Now she was singing about snowmen! While she was murdering her mom! What the fuck, right? Not even I'm that dead inside, and I murder people for fun! If I had a corporeal presence, I would have shit myself. Instead, I was just forced out of the kids body. I have no idea what happened to the kid or the mother, because I was not sticking around long enough to find out.

I do know one thing though. I am never possessing a child again.

After extensive investigation by a third party (Hades inc.) we’ve concluded that your political campaign has crippled the effectiveness of future possessions.  
Cease and desist your political campaign before it’ corruption irreversibly damages the stock.

Happy Holidays.

"[WP] A demon possesses a little girl, but inside her it finds something...worse.",TheOneSaneGuy,"A dull hum of demonic chanting poured forth from his daughter's lips, her head twitching rhythmically at an inhuman angle. ""BUUURN IN HELLLLL FAATHERRRR. WEEEE WILLL ALL BURN IN HELL!"" she bellows, voice distorted and broken. As she does so, the old man stops. He sets down a heavily laden tray of tools and approaches, face locked in a quizzical stare. As he sits down, his face shifts into a smile, then breaks open with laughter. The demon, first caught unawares by the man's candor and again by his perfectly black eyes, growls, ""YOUUU WERE PREPARED FORRRR ME? HUMAN? WERRRE YOU GIVEN WAAAAR-"", the old man cuts the fool thing off with another loud laugh. ""You? Prepared for YOU? Fool, look about you. You are not bound to some peasant girl's bedposts with sheets by an old priest and his apprentice. Fool. Hah! May whatever power you serve grant your soul peace."" As the man rises, the beast writhes again, finally looking about as captive, rather than captor. The girls wrists and ankles are bound with heavy leather cuffs reinforced with steel bands bearing strange runes; the girl's waist and chest are crossed in similar straps, each secured to a stone floor with heavy iron rings. As fear turns to panic in the demon, the sigils on its bonds begin to slowly pulse, the light growing, until, slowly, each pulse fills the room with blinding light. ""WHAT MANNERRR OF TREAAACHERYYY IS THISSS? WHOOO OF THE NIIINE CIRCLESS DARES CHALLENGE AZAAAZELLL?"", the girls body snaps to stillness, body held awkwardly as if caught halfway between one breath and the next. The pulsing sigils have been stopped as well, washing the room with odd purple-tinged light. Eyes locked in place, the demon's view is locked towards the wall. As panic mounts to terror and rational thought leaves the demon, it catches a glimpse of small shadow at the edge of its vision. As the shadow begins to pulsate, our demon hears a soft, beautiful voice begin to sing,  
  
""Darkness come to quell the light, bringer of eternal night,    
I only wish to make you whole, I ask you now into my soul.""  

On the final note, the darkness doubles in size, then doubling again, until it stands as tall as a man. Casting no shadow, it seems to simply become closer to the bed. As what would be its head draws closer to the girls eyes, the demon notices a small pinhole of a somehow darker space directly in the center of the entity's face. A strange stillness overcomes the demon as he focuses on the point, somehow drawing closer to it, though the girl does not move. As the point seems to grow larger by proximity, the demon's mind breaks, reducing its consciousness to a quivering state of perfect madness. The girl bursts out with laughter, and the darkness rushes into her.   


The next morning, the man unshackles his daughter, her eyes another shade darker than the previous day, the runes on her bonds entirely gone. It is not a small cost, keeping the darkness at bay, but it is one they are bound to pay. They set to the task of preparing for the next cycle, carving new runes and preparing to snare another demon, until the daughter's eyes are blackened. Another pair will take their place, and on again until darkness returns to the land. The darkeyed know better than to break a pact with an elder god, for they know what awaits us all in the darkness.",usernameforlfg
"[WP] A demon possesses a little girl, but inside her it finds something...worse.",TheOneSaneGuy,"She was rated a 1. Belzebub himself was 'only' rated 29. Compared to her, he might aswell have been a puppy.

Hywor had never seen a human with a rating below 50 million, let alone heard of any parents of such infinit kindness as to try and raise a child of such high threat. He peered out of her eyes, the sun was shining, the sky was blue with only a few clouds. It took him a moment to adjust to the sky, Hywor did not come up from the depths to the mortal relm too often.

Having steadied himself he looked down, the child was wearing a pink floral dress, barefoot, she was playing in a sandbox. Typical of a child her age. What was not typical was the boy rolling on his back next to her, hands covering his eyes, feet kicking and emitting blood curdling screams, echoing accross the woody playground.

The child.... Samantha, Hywor gathered from the child's mind, reached for another handfull of moist heavy grit sand. ""SHA-SHA-SHA!"" she squealed as she fell to her knees onto his stomach and plunged the sand deep into the boy's gapping, screaming mouth. Truely, the battlecry of a fifth circle demon.

""Samantha, honey!"" the voice of a young female reached his ears, Samantha never looked away from her prey. The demon gleamed internally as someone else was about to bear witness to the child's display. ""You play nice, okay?"" It occured to Hywor that the parents may not be kind at all.

Rather, they may be idiots.

Grinning ever wider the child, if Samantha could still be called a child as her mind was a battlefield of fire, carcasses and hurt, blindly but with convinction, reached for the corners of the standbox with her right hand , clasped itself around the old dacying wooden frame and ripped out an impressive shard, splinters bitting into her hand.

The boy was now only sobbing, his body in trembles with a slight hiccup. He was rubbing his blood-shot eyes with tiny fists. One handed, Samantha pulled at the boys fingers with her left hand and pinned them down with all her weight.

The boy had but a few moments to realize what was happening as Samantha thrusted the wooden stake into his wet, fragile eye.

At this Hywor disconnected himself from the girl. He was only meant to seed doubts in her head, to turn her towards Satan's works such as rock'n'roll and animé. This was beyond his expertise. 

Shaking his head, Hywor returned to Hell.",Timoris
"[WP] A demon possesses a little girl, but inside her it finds something...worse.",TheOneSaneGuy,"Dreams. I still can't believe all humans don't realize it: We demons possess people in their dreams. Why else would they dream about a fiery hell or falling forever? Subconsciousness? Oh please. The best of us are able to get nightmares consistently from our sleepy husks, the worst have to deal with rainbows, sunshine and ugh... lollipops. I'm pretty good at it, one time I even managed to convince my human to stand up and sleepwalk near a window. 

Lo and behold though, since that time I was really in a funk. It had only been 6 humans that I've taken over since, but my gosh had I had very little success. My most recent possessing was a dream filled with successfully running a race. I had had enough! I was going to find an easy victim this time... Hmm.. Hmm... THERE! That little girl, who cries all the time because she thinks her daddy doesn't like her. I'll just push on that for a bit. Ahh perfect, now she's going to sleep.

Alright, just a little pressure here... and a nudge there and that should just about... What.. is that sound? Am... I... getting tired... in a girl's dream? How the... zzz. 

Whoa! OK what the hell just happened! If I fall asleep in someone's dream... do I stay here forever? How long have I been out? Where am I?What's that in the distance? I can see uhh some pale skin on a round creature. Oh man that skin is terrifying, there's not a single feature to it. It's just... there. I don't understand... What is it holding? OH MY GOD...

[WP] A new drug is invented - it makes you experience everyday life as if you're in a fairy tale.,VisceralBlade,"""Serving size: 10mg.  Do not exceed recommend dose.""  read the directions on the zip lock packet.  

I wasn't sure what to expect when I received my first delivery of what the website called ""Citalopept"".  What I did know was that the Government are looking to criminalise it in the near future, so I thought I best get my hands on some whilst it's still legal.  I'd done my research, read the reviews online of people describing ""out of body"" experiences; I even watched a couple of videos on YouTube; one of which saw some dumbass kid trying it for the first time, and sharing his first trip with the entire internet.  
Anything for that dimly lit fifteen minutes.

Whilst the thought of having an out of body experience seemed cool, I didn't want to go that far; I just wanted to try out something new, get a little high was all. Something to take the edge of, you know?  So the day comes, I get my order.  I'm nervous- not like I'm scared, more 'discovery-anxiety' as my friend Dale called it.  Those butterflies you get before you try something new; I got it the first time I smoked my first joint.  That underlying anxiety you try so hard to mask in front of all the other cool kids in the smoke and dark of the school bike sheds; the little thought in the back of your head that says ""What if I never come back?""

But whatever, that was dumbass kids, doing dumbass things, thinking dumbass shit.  I was 24 years old now.  I'd spent a large portion of my student loan sniffing coke off nightclub toilet seats, as my mind took me back to the promise the shady fella in the black BMW made me 2 hours prior, that-

""This shit will change your life, man."" 

-only to realise it's cut with- what is this shit?- Baking Powder?  
Just like Granny used to make.

But sorry, I digress.  It came with a 10mg scoop.  The instructions said to weigh it, but I didn't have scales to hand.  Apparently, the most effective way is to place the dose under the tongue and leave it there for up to ten minutes.  The trip would last for 5 hours and would take effect almost instantly and under no circumstances was I to take more than the stated dose.

Fine, I thought, scooping 10mg of the powder under my tongue.  Fine.  Man, that's bitter.  Everything's fine  I thought.  Everything is fine.  Everything is fine right now how much did I take?  It's fine.  It's just the anxiety.  Honestly it's fine I thought to myself.  You're only nervous because it's the first time you're taking this.  It's fine.  Don't worry about it.  Last time you tripped you were with people, but you'll be fine.  Dale said you'll be fine.  You can trust Dale. Shit should've weighed the fucking thing.  
How much did it say to take?  

""10mg.""  

Right. It's fine.  
Am I feeling anything yet?  

""The pack says almost instantly, it said-""

I'll just take a little dab more, make sure it's in my system properly. That's it! Didn't put it under my tongue long enough.  Just one more dab I thought.  That'll sort me out I thought.  Shit, that's bitter- it's like- what is this?  Fucki- 

""This shit will change your life, man.""

-ng cooking salt powder?  Am I breathing too heavy?  I feel like I'm breathing too heavy. 
It's fine. 
But my- 

""It's fine, I told you Dale, everything is fine- you've seen the dumbass kids on Youtube smoking their first joint with all the cool kids in the smoke and dark of your school bike sheds trying to go into a bad trip- everything's fine.  How much did you- Shit, man.  This shit is gonna change your life....""

The phone rings from the other side of the room.  
You're at the phone.

""Hello?""

""Is that you?""

""Yes.""

""Good. I need you to come fuck me.""

""Who is this?""

""The Princess.""

""Of course.""

""I need you to come rescue me.  I'm sleeping at moment, but there are rose thorns surrounding my castle and I need you to come fuck me and wake me up.  Can you do that?""

You hesitate, wiping the sweat from your brow, mouth's a little dry, jaw's a little loose.  Shit, am I breathing too heavy?  Am I-

""Can you do that?""

""Yeah.  Yeah, sure I can do that.  Where you at?""

""Come fuck me. Hurry.""

""Yeah.  Yeah.  Sure.""

You put the phone down.  Gotta go, gotta go fuck the princess.  
Where did you put my Jacket, Dale?

""Over here, lad.""  Comes a call from sofa. 

Shit, there's my jacket. 

You put the jacket on your body by inserting your arms through the sleeves of the jacket first, then once the arm is covered, take no more than 10mg of-

""Say, whatcha doin' today lad?  Tinking of popping inteh town?""

I was gonna go fuck the princess.

""In dis state?  How much have you taken me boyo?  You look fooked, if I do say so meself.""

But the Princessaid she needed to fuck-

""Are you breathing a bit heavily?""

No. I'm fine.

""Aye, now you mention it, you've come round a wee bit.  Don't moind me, den. I'll just be here sewing the seams of your ol' tatty boots whilst you're oot fucking de princess.""  

Said the two foot Ginger, Irish man, fiddling with your ol' tatty boots that are torn at the seams.

""Hey, I'm only two foot tall because I ain't got no legs!  An we all know why dat happened don't we?""
....
""Fooking Dragons!  Well, you best be off Lad, the princess won't fuck herself, will she?  Go on, off you fook into town.""

You walk outside with me and we're suddenly in the town centre together of the town we grew up in as a young Boy.
  
""I'd just be careful of that breathing of yours though, boyo.  You sound like you're breathing too heavy.""

It's fine though.  I only took a little bit more than the 10mg scoop told me to take.  

""This shit will change your life, man.""

I am awoken by the telephone. The voice on the receiver speaks.

""We need you. 553 Williams rd."" 

""I'm coming""

My arm instinctively reaches across to Susan's side of the bed, but she isn't there. She has been gone for awhile now. Her vacant spot a regular consequence of the night shift at the hospital.

I get up and dress. Leaving my room I hesitate outside of Paul's room. He hasn't been home since thanksgiving.

I drive to the address. The flashing red and blue adding an ominous effect to the Christmas lights that hang on the houses. I get out and walk up to sergeant Gillesprie. 

""What's the situation Janet?""

"" 24 year old kid male inside says he had a gun, says he's gonna off his family and then himself""

""What do we know? Drugs? Criminal record? History?""

""Nothing.""

"" who called it in?""

""He did""

""Give me a megaphone, what's his name?""

""Terrance""

She hands me the megaphone. I slowly approach the lawn.

""Terrance, my name is Chris Lambert, and I'm here to talk to you. There's a lot of people here who are very frightened. Your family, your neighbors myself, the cops out here, we are all afraid that you are about to make a huge mistake. And Terry I know you are frightened too. I know that you are. So why don't we talk. Why don't you help put us at ease.""

I receive no response.

""Alright I'll start. Terry, I don't know what's going on right now. I know this time of year can be tough, the days are short, the holidays can be stressful and lonely. But you need to think about the people that care about you, the people with you in that house you don't want to hurt them.  I know you don't.

A voice shouts from inside, a young shaking voice.

""How do you know I won't?""

I respond slowly.

""Because if you had wanted to do it you wouldn't have called anyone. I think you are afraid and didn't know how else to speak about it so you've done something rash. But you haven't done anything permanent yet, there is still time to turn back. Put the gun down and come outside, we can get you help.""

""Okay, I'm coming out""

""Terry make sure you put the gun down, and have your hands up. I trust you, bit I don't want anyone to make a mistake. We're all friends here hit remover we are afraid too.""

""I will""

The front door slowly opens and a young man steps out. His face resembles that of a child who's been separate from his mother. He reminds me of Paul.

In a few moments the officers are on him. I walk away, I don't need to see this part. 

Janet approaches me.

""I'll come by the office in the morning to fill out a report, I want some sleep""

She nods.

I drive him my fingers itching at the pale ring where a wedding band had once hing. My eyes drift to the cars parked along the side of the road. Marks of home filled with visitors to celebrate the joy and togetherness that holidays bring.

I step into my home and over to the dresser I pull out a letter, the envelope has say filled and stamped for a week now. I read the note inside once more then seal it. I review the address once more before placing it in the mailbox. 

""To Paul from your loving father""

I step back inside and take the revolver out of the safe. It's barrel cold against my skin. Before the hammer falls a single ironic thought passes across my mind.

""A perfect record""",Dmcgurk13

You've been working for decades and have never lost anyone, when nothing else has worked you're the one people call. Tell me the story of your first failure.",YouBetItsLuke,"You get to know so many people that names become almost meaningless. 

It's horrible to say, I know. Trust me, I know. There's just something about all the Jennifer's and the Brad's having the same life problems that names just aren't something you keep track of. When you get somebody who calls back, and you struggle to remember their name. I guess I just got tired of it being worth it. 

Don't get me wrong, I love my work. I love the people I meet, the lives I can save. I've been broken and I've been lost and I've been back together again. Some people say I'm the best, but I think I'm just lucky. You see, there's three questions you ask. 

1. Are you considering suicide as an option?

2. Do you have a plan for how you are going to end your life?

3. Have you taken any steps to end your life?

Most people get to two, and stop. You learn so much about them in such a short period of time, and they want to share everything. I tried to remember each one once. Like names, they all get lost somewhere in the mix. One story matches up, though. One story and one name that will never leave my head. 

Her name was Rose. 

She was an honors student in her university. She didn't have debt, or no friends, or family. She explained that she had a wonderful life, and she deeply cared about everyone in it. She was sure that they cared about her, to some level, but she couldn't understand it. Rose went on to explain her English major, how she had wanted to work with children who couldn't read properly. 

Her little brother had a learning disability, and that's where she had gotten the idea from. She had loved to read, and learn, and teach others. It was really a special talent had it been the way she described. When she was little, she had read to him for hours, making him follow along with the words, pushing him a little farther each time, getting the old dusty dictionary out so much that it no longer was lined with dust on each page. Their mother had to always push them away from their books and pull them into bed. It had been a nice story, and I couldn't understand why she was calling the hotline. 

She said, her voice slow, *I don't know. I just feel lonely.*

In her near perfect life, with everything she could ever want, she felt lonely. 

So, I asked her those three little questions. 

""Are you considering suicide as an option?""

*Yes.*

""Do you have a plan for how you are going to end your life?""

*Yes.*

""Have you taken any steps to end your life?""

Her response was slow and distant, *I don't want to die.*

I asked her for her address, and told my coworker to call the police, and toxicology. She had taken a bottle of sleeping pills, and I had talked her to her death. 

By the end of the phone call, her replies were long and slow, taking minutes for her to get them out. By the end, it was silent. I could only assume the police had gotten to her. 

Then I did what I was never supposed to do. I became obsessed with finding her. I needed to know if her beautiful story had ended. And I did find it. She had officially died from an 'accidental overdose'. I can tell you, it wasn't accidental. 

No, I haven't saved everyone. I kept her death to myself, I broke myself apart and built myself back up. I don't know why exactly I'm in the business now, so many years later. Maybe it's to help me. Or maybe, it's to find Rose again.

I do this all day now. It used to just be a hobby, but now it has become my obsession. 

It just started as kind of a joke. I didn't actually think it would work. I read that XKCD comic, **[I know you're listening](http://xkcd.com/525/)**. And that got me thinking: what if it's not the NSA out there? What if I'm on TV? Not like the Truman Show; I mean, what if *I* am a fictional character?

I started out by saying things that the audience might expect someone to say in a monologue, thinking that if it seemed like it was *supposed* to be a part of the script, then maybe it would get through. And for a while, it worked. I heard the laughs, and their responses back. 

But after about a week, nothing. No more feedback. I've tried changing what I say, how I say it. I tell jokes. I sob and cry. But as far as I can tell, it's not getting through. My neighbors think I'm absolutely crazy. I told them about the responses, and how it *had* worked for a while. Naturally they don't believe me. 

Someone is stopping me. I don't know who, or what, or why. It doesn't matter what I say, or what I do. I always get the same reply:

Why... okay, okay, I'll tell it one more time, but then it's the end, I'm sleepy.

It started out with little things like making finger-pistols into the direction of the trashcan whenever I managed to successfully throw a piece of garbage into it from a distance. Soon however I realized that the enjoyment didn't come so much from the hitting the trashcan (picking up all the things that didn't went in made it far less enjoyable than it should be), but the gesturing.

I know, it might sound pathetic, but I was at a really low point at that particular time in my life, I had moved to a new city and no friends to hang out with. None of the people I worked with were friend-material, and chatting online with people for no reason always felt so... weird. And for some reason pretending that some invisible watcher got to experience these 'out of character'-moments just made me happy. Sure, one could argue that this should feel more weird than chatting with a friend, but it wasn't. It felt silly, but never weird. But maybe that's just my social anxiety talking.

Anyway, soon I started new things. I would sometimes just stop walking, glance up in a 45° angle and smile. Like I just had a happy thouht and wanted this watcher to know. And in a way, I did - the happy thought just happened to be pretty self-referential.

From time to time I would use quick wit in situations where none was needed. Like staircase-wit, where you think of a great response only after a conversation is over, just that in my scenario I would speak the response out loud to an empty room, like it was some sort of scene-change in a sitcom for comedic effect.

With no friends however those instances of quick wit were far too few for my taste, so I did other things. I wrote messages like ""I know you are watching"" or ""should I feel flattered about all the attention I'm getting?"" on pieces of paper and showed them to surveillance cameras, I would pick up my phone from time to time and simply speak into the microphone, without calling anyone beforehand, etc. etc.

It made my life so much more interesting.

But after only one week it all changed.

I once again sat in the teahouse near my workplace, acting like I was ignoring the CCTV outside, daydreaming what kind of episode the audience would get to experience, when suddenly a car crashed into the lamppost the cameras were attached to. I started from the sudden movement and immediately ran outside to check on the driver, while most of the other people in the teahouse only started whispering over what could've possibly happened and whether the driver was drunk or not.

As I got closer to the car, the driver's door already opened and a short man with round glasses, hat and dark jacket stumbled out of the car. His steps were uneven, I assumed that he had hurt his leg in the accident until I saw that he had a cane on his side.

""Sir are you okay? What happ...""

""I'm alright, don't worry about me. It's YOU we should worry about.""

I remember blinking at that, it was such a completely unexpected response, I completely forgot what I wanted to say for a moment.

""What? What do you mean? Sir, are you really...""

""Yeah yeah, I'm alright. Mister Sherman, I'm afraid I do not have a lot of time to explain, so I'll make it short: You need to stop talking to it.""

I don't recall what I said to him in response, I probably was frozen in shock. I had, and have, no idea how he knew my name. I didn't know who he was, I know I should've asked what he was talking about, but at that moment I simply couldn't think about a single thing but 'I was right'. All this talking to 'noone' all this time, there was someone, something that had been listening, had been watching.

Before I could ask anything further from him, I heard the sirens, and before I could intervene, he had already stepped back into his car and driven away. I already told you that the car didn't have a number-plate.

Please, I really don't know who he is. Can I go home now?

Please, I want to sleep, stop asking, I swear that I never worked for him. I'm sleepy, please let me sleep.

You can't do that, I'm an american citizen, please, I just want to go home...

[WP] Out of boredom you decide to break the 4th wall like you are on tv. After a week a strange man appears and yells at you to stop doing that.,badatspelilng,"I don't remember when I started doing it, but I do remember why: The blind hope that everything around me had just been a fabrication, a lie. 
That the way I felt was because somehow I knew, and someone out there was just watching me to see how I would cope with all the obstacles they kept putting in front of me. As strange as it sounds, I just thought that maybe...if I reached out enough, they could fix things and make it alright. Make me the way I want to be with a wave of their hand so people could see who I really was inside. After all, if that person could orchestrate all of this, they should have been able to do that. Right?

So each morning when I'd get ready for the day, I'd talk to the air. I started with asking simple things, like if they liked the way I did my hair, or my earrings.
Then at night while I undressed, I'd summarize my day. The trials, successes, occasional congratulations, though mostly it was all self-deprecation.
When days were really rough, I'd find a bathroom where I could be alone to stare into the mirror and talk myself back up. Sometimes, when I was angry, I'd snap and ask if whoever they were were happy with my situation and my struggles. 

I don't know when this thing I did in private slipped out into the public. It had become too much of a habit I guess, and I only noticed on the day that I spilled wine on my lavender dress. I was at a cocktail party and I could hear some women whispering things about me. They thought my shoulders too broad, my mid drift too thick, speculating that I had a....No matter, they were cruel words coming from women as thin and sharp as sticks. I tried to ignore them, but couldn't stop my hands from trembling, and as I tried to escape I stumbled and stained my beautiful dress. 

I rushed to the bathroom as best I could in my heels, locked the door, and held back a scream. ""Are you entertained?"" I asked bitterly as I wiped away the eye makeup that had slid out of place, fighting back tears, and continued tidying up my face. I tried to salvage what I could of my dress, even though I knew it was ruined.

From out of nowhere came a man that I hadn't noticed at the party earlier. He grumbled and growled. ""You need to *stop*.""

""I've done nothing wrong! You tell *them* to stop.""

""That's not what I'm talking about. Stop trying to break the fourth wall. You're ruining my immersion.""

""Your immersion!?""

""I want ‘The Bad Ending’ achievement, and you’re making me feel terrible about it. I didn’t shell out 2000 credits for this VR system and game combo for nothing. This game was supposed to be rated the best game of the year. If I’d known it was this bugged I wouldn’t have bought it. Keep your misery to yourself! If I wanted to feel miserable I would have bought Dragon Age 8 and romanced an apostate!”

With that, he vanished.

“So it’s an achievement you want, is it? That’s why all these bad things happen to me? Well then, we’ll see about that.”

I slapped on a new coat of lipstick and smiled.

“Because I’m going to make this world my happy place.”",Staleina

I supplied my own sad trombone sound and winked at my kitchen wall, then I picked the toast.  Of course it had landed butter side down.  I sighed and grabbed a paper towel and wiped the butter off the floor.  I tossed the toast and crumpled paper towel away.  Honestly, I hadn't really been hungry to begin with.  I was more eating out of boredom.

The idea that I had Ebola was ridiculous.  Yes, technically I'd been in Africa during the right time window, but Africa is an enormous place.  Quarantining people who'd been in Cameroon when there was an outbreak in Kenya was like quarantining people who'd been in Portugal when there was an outbreak in Norway.  I had tried explaining that to the Health Canada people but it seemed like they knew, they were just following orders.

I flicked on the TV more out of habit than thinking I'd actually find anything worth watching.  My DVR had been empty for days now, and there's only so much CNN that a person can take.  At first I'd followed news of the outbreak, partially to see what was happening but with some guilt I admitted I'd hoped to hear about myself on TV.  But no, no mentions of me.  Having a Canadian quarantined just wasn't newsworthy.  No 15 minutes of fame for me, even indirectly.

I guess that was why I'd started pretending I was on the most boring reality TV show ever.  Imagine the ""Big Brother"" house with only one occupant.  The occupant wasn't an oversexed nympho, she wasn't a cunning, backstabbing ""real housewife"".  I'd tried to put on a pretend cooking show, but there's really nothing you can do when all you have to work with are the standard quarantine fare of canned foods and white bread.

I wandered over to the window.  At least I could people-watch.  The 5th floor window looked out onto a busy street and even late at night when I couldn't sleep there was normally something happening out there.

Today I was in luck, near the bus stop there was a blonde young woman in yoga pants.  A few metres away were a couple of young guys, and it was clear that one of them was trying to work up the courage to approach her.  I picked up my sharpie and held it up like a microphone.

""*Here we see the start of the human mating ritual.  The male of the species is normally larger and stronger, but in the matter of sex, it is the human female who chooses her mate.*""  I kept turning to address the discolouration on the wall that I'd decided was a camera.

""*Note his approach, the male thrusts out his chest to appear physically stronger.  The female, meanwhile, feigns an utter lack of interest, but keen observers will note that she has started twisting her hair around her finger.*""

I was actually starting to really get wrapped up in this unfolding drama when I heard a loud ""*CUT!*"" and a bell ringing.

I turned immediately to face the source of the noise and noticed the corner between two walls... unfolding.  The room still had 4 walls, but it also had a gap between two of them where were bright lights in a dark space.  Out of that space stepped a creature that looked like some kind of a centaur-squid.

""*Everybody, take 5!*"" It shouted behind itself as it approached me.

""*Look, you have to stop doing that.*""  It adjusted some kind of device on its face with one tentacle while another couple were punching things into what looked like some kind of smart phone.  I couldn't really spot an eye, but it was clearly addressing me.

""*I... wuh...*""

""*Your narration is really messing up the Earthers documantary.  Would you quit it?*""

""*Earthers?*""

""*Earthers, Humans... you know, you.  You know it's right there in your contract, no narration.*""

Something in the blank look I gave in response must have clued the creature in.

""*Oh fhygmahn!  Sghena, can we get a diagnostic on the Earther?  Did the masking wear off?*"" the Squid-Centaur said, and a sort of beetle scuttled over on its hind legs.

The newest creature started waving some kind of wand near my head while clicking to itself.

It must have been shock that made me look out the window, but it didn't help matters.  The blonde in yoga pants had her head under her arm.  It wasn't a yoga pose, instead the green-skinned creature wearing the human costume was clearly taking a break with the costume head removed.  The ""boys"" who'd been approaching her were lying down in a rigid posture, apparently charging from a device which had popped out of the street nearby.

""*Yeah, Gzhen, the mask is still in place.  She was just being human.  Looks like they just sometimes... do that.*""

""*Are you sure we didn't just abduct a defective one?*"", Gzhen whined.  He knew he wasn't going to get an answer to his question, he was mostly just venting.

""*Look Earther, you're going to forget this in a minute, but cut out that narration.  Maybe it will stick in your subconscious or something.  Sghena, flash her.*"" Gzen ordered.

The beetle held up a device in front of my eyes and there was a bright flash...  Quarantine was so boring.  Nothing ever happened.",immerc

I was puzzled. It was a bald man with a goatee, and he was wearing a turquoise polo shirt and khaki pants. 
""Who are you?"" I exclaimed.
""I am your mother's brother."" He said.
""U-uncle Larry, is that you?""
It was uncle Larry, who had gone missing at aged sixteen. That was all I knew about him. Apparently he was at a high school house party and disappeared. 
""Where have you been all of this time?"" I asked. 
""I have been here and I will always be here. Before I talk any longer, I must ask, how many times have you used this, well, ability?""
I thought for a moment. ""About twelve""
He responded with concern ""Well you are one lucky son of a bitch. The time I disappeared was the time I broke the wall for the thirteenth time. While you are still here, why don't we make some use of your hopefully last visit and go for a burger.""
""Okay""
""Kid, I'm glad I saw you, or else you would be stuck in this purgatory for good. It's fucking lonely here. Wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy. You know one day, I was at a party, got a bit too drunk and thought it would be a fun idea to freeze up the place and lift up some skirts. Little did I know that this time I wouldn't freeze anything but just disappear into the 4th wall as life goes on around me. Basically, your thirteenth time will be ineffective and your mom will miss you, unless you use it for good. Than you shall be granted 13 more chances.""
""Gee, thanks Uncle Larry, you saved me.""
""No problem, kid. Now it is a bad world out there and use your last power for good, or else I'll be seeing you again, and as much as I would love that, it would really blow for you.   And whatever you do, do not tell anybody, got that?""
""Yes, got it!""
""Good, now get out of here!""
I was back on my couch, watching TV. Boy was I shaking. My mom walked in the room and said, ""Alex, it's late, go to bed. Are you alright? You look pale.""
""Yes mom, I'm fine.""
""Well get some sleep so your not a zombie for your test tomorrow""
""Yes mom.""
She went to her the room where my father was already asleep and closed the door. I went to my room and got the bong out. 
""Christ"" I said to myself before taking a huge rip. Then I got into bed and passed out.
The next day in class, I wasn't focusing on the teacher at all, but instead, fantasizing about the moment I could use this final 4th wall break. I thought about the moment a kid pulled out a gun in class, or the moment a group of terrorists walked into the mall with AKs. For about three months of my senior year, I obsessed about the golden moment that I could be a hero. 
One springtime day, I was walking to my second period when I noticed Brent and Rodger, two strange softmores' who only hang with each other and nobody else, walking down the hallway with tennis bags. They were wearing sun glasses and had earbuds in. They were looking around in a really paranoid way and they walked into the 
restrooms. After hearing all the bad stuff on the news, this was a huge red flag for me. I waited for the bell to ring, and I stepped into the bathroom. Me heart was pounding. When I opened the door, I saw the two kids holding hunting rifles. 
Rodger, with a smirk, said ""What do you say, Brent?"" 
As they were cocking the rifles and pointing them at me, time froze. Talk about relief! I examined the two goofs as I was walking around them. Brent had his finger on the trigger, so I carefully pealed it off, and pealed the other hand off the barrel. I did the same for Rodger. I took the two guns, and set them outside the bathroom. I went to the janitor's closet and got some rope. I went back to the bathroom and tied the two goofs together, extra tight so they couldn't escape. When I unfroze time, I looked the two boys in the eyes. They were in shock, and struggling to escape. I laughed at them, took out my iPhone and dialed 911. I was a hero with 13 more points, but I told no one about my abilities. 
Best of all, I lived like a king for the rest of my senior year. I was even on Oprah!

After a week a strange man appears and yells at you to stop doing that.,badatspelilng,"I've been breaking the fourth wall for a while now. I have always talked to myself. Not in a schizophrenic type of way... I believe the distinction is that I know the voices in my head are all just me, that they are not real. They are different versions of myself, or people I've met who I project my ideas onto. Often when I'm driving, I talk to the invisible person in my passenger seat. Sometimes it is my dad, or my roommate, or my ex-girlfriend. I have a conversation and have them answer the way they would have, and it helps me to sometimes put ethical questions into a new point of view. I talk to my cat when its just the two of us home alone. I think of this as a thinking technique, sort of like Sherlock's 'mind palace' if you will. Just a special way to arrange my thoughts. I don't know if fourth wall characters have become more common in recent pop culture, or if I am just becoming more exposed to it. But after recently watching Community, Rick and Morty, House of Cards, Deadpool, and especially Mr. Robot, I've decided to give a new name to the entity I've been talking to this whole time. I've been talking to the audience. I have been the whole time, but it is only recently that I have been addressing them as such. And by them, I really mean me. Some internal part of my brain, the part that is self aware. The part that is just along for the ride, that has been watching this 23 year long movie through the lenses of my eyeballs the whole time. The entity that never sleeps, that watches my dreams when I am sleeping. The entity that changes the channel when I get stoned, and starts watching something unique and different, all while following most of the same characters but in a slightly altered setting.

After a week a strange man appears and yells at you to stop doing that.,badatspelilng,"The clock didn't tick any faster when you stared at it. Quite the opposite. Tucker found scant relief in noting that the first hour of the workday had passed. As he squinted at his screen and the “survey creation wizard” on it, he recalled the words of his zen master. The only bondage was in one's mind. If one stopped identifying with his misery, the master said, and instead saw himself as only a witness to events--a player on a stage--he'd be free. Whatever that meant.

Just then, a girl laughed gloriously. Tucker turned to see the gorgeous new receptionist Stephanie giggling. He frowned when he saw the man standing by Stephanie's desk. Randy, the bafflingly popular ""creative"" of the office. A man paid obscenely well to make garish strokes on Photoshop once or twice a day while pacing on the noisy treadmill desk he'd demanded as part of his pay. The girls fawned over him. Even after he'd bedded them, not called and moved on to his next. It was Stephanie’s turn. Tucker's heart fluttered a little when he saw her, but why bother when Randy was already pissing around her desk.

Tucker realised he'd been staring and that Randy had noticed. 

""What you lookin' at, ButtTucker?"" Randy shot at him.

Tucker sighed and turned back to his desk.

""Something funny huh?"" The creative persisted.

Tucker slowly looked at him. ""Not your joke.""

He turned to one side and grinned. ""Am I right?"" he said to no one. It felt good.

He got back to his survey wizard. ""It’s not a real wizard,"" he said to his imaginary audience. ""I still have to do the work. If this is a wizard, Dumbledore would've had an impossibly handsome young man holding his wand all the time.... That’s what Hermione said!""


""I’m only here temporarily,” Tucker explained as he sat in an empty conference room, looking at an imaginary camera. “How long? Oh…I've been here five years, but you know, plans take time...”

He blinked, as if marking a cut in a recording.

""Well there’s three types of bleach and we ask consumers which they want to use... 

""No, I actually...I've chosen to forgo a promotion track. Allows me to leave at any moment. I'm pretty spontaneous...""

Master was right about this be-a-witness-in-your-life thing!


On the subway home, Tucker squeezed into a corner seat between the glass barrier and a portly man watching a sitcom with laugh track audible through his earphones. Tucker turned to the glass. ""What's the deal with multicam sitcoms, am I right?"" The sitcom’s canned laughter followed, and Tucker did a little bow, satisfied.

As Tucker tucked himself into bed, he leaned over to the side to turn off a lamp. As he did, he smiled. ""Tune into tomorrow's episode of Totally Tucked for more surveys, and a distant glimpse at Stephanie in another gloriously low cut top. Only on TBS…uh, the Tucker…BS!"" Lights out.


This continued for the next few days. Tucker retreated from his desk to a conference room periodically to regale his viewers with details of office happenings. Invariably his attention turned to Stephanie (and he would often need to excuse himself for a few moments to take a bathroom trip), or intolerable Randy, but there was some variety. And at the gym Tucker showed how a treadmill was really meant to be used.


On another subway ride home, Tucker noticed everybody else in his carriage was staring at a screen of some kind. He turned to the glass. ""Well, strictly speaking, I'm talking to a screen too, but wow this--"" 

A hard BANG on the glass. Tucker was shaken and looked up to see an angry man looking right at him. Unshaven and dressed in winter gear, he looked sullen. ""Stop it!"" he snapped at Tucker.

""Uh...stop what?"" Tucker said, grinning.

""You know what I'm talking about!"" said the man. ""Enough of this!""

""What's your problem, man?""

""All of this--"" the man said, gesturing to everything, ""it's not about you! So quit acting like you're the lead! You're not! You're--"" the man turned to look out the window as the train slowed. ""I gotta get off here. But remember,"" he said with a stern finger pointed. ""Enough!""

The door opened and the man left. Tucker thought for a moment. And then asked the audience, ""is he crazy, or am I for the fact that I'm about to follow him?""

Tucker grinned and got off the train, tailing the man from a distance up the platform, through the ticket hall and out onto a quiet street. He followed the man to a house and saw him walk up the stairs to the door. Tucker sprinted up those stairs, catching the door behind the man before it swung shut, startling the man.

""Who IS the lead?"" Tucker yelled.

The man screamed and tried to shove Tucker out. ""You're not supposed to be here!""

""Tell me!""

""I can’t!”

""Who is it?"" Tucker repeated as he overpowered him. ""You?""

""Me?” the man replied, resigned. “Don't be ridiculous. I'm a day player.""
	

A few moments later Tucker sat with the man, Horace, in the latter’s kitchen.

""The director's not happy with what you're doing to the show. I was hired--""

""The show? I'm really on a TV show?""

""Yes, anyway, I was hired to tell you to put a stop to this. It's not your show. Nor is it mine.""

""Well, whose is it?"" Tucker asked.

""That fella in your office who walks at his desk...""

Seriously? ""Randy?"" Tucker didn't hide his dismay. ""Of all the people in the world. He's a total asshole!""

""Since when has nice been the same as interesting?"" Horace countered. ""I mean, ask yourself why you're single and you always strike out.""

""I don't always strike out.""

""Usually, then. And before you get high and mighty, remember you're not even that nice. You're always ogling that new girl's bosom. You're meek on the outside but you're no different than Randy. He's just got the gravitas to follow through on it. That's interesting.""

""Well if I'm so boring, who cares about my little soliloquys?""

""Touché, buddy. Truth is, director and execs don’t care for it but audiences are lapping up your little asides. Twitter's on fire with people saying finally this show's willing to poke fun at how stupid it is. But it’s not what the network intended. So, they told me to tell you, enough is enough. Put a stop to it.""

Tucker frowned. If by all accounts he was making the show better, why should he cede it back to Randy? If audiences really were responding well--if ratings were going up--then the director would jeopardize the show by trying to stop Tucker.
""I'm not going to change what I'm doing.""

""You have to!"" Horace said, alarmed.

""I'll wait and see if they make me. Now, you say you're a day player. So, what, you going to die tomorrow or something?""

""Die? No, no, I'm just supposed to sit tight here. Indefinitely.""

""That sounds deadly boring. How about I make you my supporting character?""
	

Tucker got Horace hired at the office. Together they embarked on a stylistic and narrative venture like never before. Maybe it was the Randy Show, but they made it “Randy by Tucker and Horace”. With astute and biting commentary on Randy's behavior, and tongue in cheek, plainly sexist “Carry On” type asides about the women in the office, the duo were a hit.

Then, one day, Horace came to work with a solemn face.

""Director sent us some notes.”

""Really?"" Tucker was surprised. ""He's finally accepted what we're doing?""

""You could say that.""

""Well, don't keep me waiting.""

Horace looked at him, apparently nervous but kind of excited.
""They are fine with you being the star of the show.""

Music to Tucker's ears!

""And they want you to take a decisive step to claim the show as your own.""

""Alright. Well, what is it?"" Tucker asked.

""You have to kill Randy.""

""Don't tease me, bro, I mean I've always wanted--""

""I'm not kidding, Tucker. You have to kill Randy. In cold blood.""

Tucker processed this. Kill Randy? Why would they want him to do that? Couldn't they just write him off the show? Well apparently not, since 'day player' Horace was still here. Killing Randy would change the tone of the show. It'd become a thriller. Tucker would be a fugitive from justice, an assassin who went into hiding. Or...he'd be caught.

""It's not a death penalty state,"" Horace said. 

""OK maybe not, but if I don't beat the heat on it, I'll go to jail for life.""

""Prison shows periodically do well and are always critically acclaimed.""

""But Horace...if I kill someone, I'll be unlikeable. Viewers love me for my natural affable charm. But if I kill a guy?""

""Not just any guy,"" Horace said. ""Asshole Randy.""

""Sure, but it ain't classy. They know that; it’s why they want me to do it. It'll ruin me. Look, no I'm not going to. We'll just keep our routine going, I mean they can’t make me--""

""If you don't do it,"" Horace interjected, ""then I have to kill you.""

Tucker stepped back. ""Why would you ever do that? We're friends.""

""I'm a professional. I do what my director asks of me. I lost sight of that in my time with you. But I'm ready to do my duty again. If you don't do yours.""

""Are you kidding?"" Tucker cried. ""You're nobody. You think if you do this they’ll give you a big part? You said it yourself, you're a day player. The only reason you’re still acting at all is ‘cos of me. You wanna murder the man who saved your career? Fine. It's your death too.""

""My popularity is not based on being likeable. I can be an antihero, as is popular now. Don't test me.""

Antiheroes, huh? He had a point. Breaking Bad, The Sopranos, Mad Men, all of them had less than empathetic leads who we just couldn't help but watch and root for. Not just on TV, but film too--Birdman, Foxcatcher--wait.

""Steve Carell...that's it!""

""What?"" Horace said, confused.

Steve Carell was the perfect role model for Tucker right now. Steve had gone from likeable comedy star to antihero. From playing an office worker who talked to the camera, to playing a murderer...in an Oscar-nominated performance. Who was to say Tucker didn't have this same destiny?

""This ain't your big break, Horace. It's mine. I'm going to kill Randy."" Tucker smiled as he imagined the brave new world that awaited.",JoruusCBaoth

I sit down at my computer again. As I begin to gather some thoughts, time speeds up. I hold conversations that will never happen. Relationships are formed and broken. Some just stop by to give a brief greeting, maybe to return another day. Whether through space or through time, journeys that should take decades pass in mere minutes. Worlds are created and destroyed in the maelstrom. 

“Hmm, what’s a weird way to make time seem slow?”

Time feels like I when pay for groceries and have to put my change away as everyone watches, as I flip a stubborn sentence around, checking how it’ll flow. A single thing can be all-consuming, destroyed and re-built until it’s satisfactory.  An event that should only take a minute stretches into eternity. 

My phone rings from across the room. The voice on the other end is unfamiliar. Time normalizes and I realize it’s my boss. He’d really like to know why I haven’t been to work in the past week. 

We haven’t broken the 4th wall. But if you know how to look at it, you can peer through the cracks.

It was as I was sitting outside on the bar's patio that he showed up right on time, 11:20 in the morning, same day, same place. He wore the same worn jacket, the shirt never the same. His hair was a shock of yellow straw, messy and unkempt. It was near the bus-stop that he came to a halt, smiling as he spoke to no one in particular,

""Here we are in sunny East Lansing, the characters flat and one dimensional, the setting generic college town. This here is our typical Thirsty Thursday, a day when the students all begin their three day weekend binge. Let's see what we can find.""

I snorted, pushing aside the remains of my burger and fries. A half-empty pint of Oberon sat to the side, its glass slick from the beads of condensation.  

""Why the fuck do you keep saying that?"" I asked over the low, wrought iron fence. The young man turned to face me.

""Pardon?""

""Every week I'm out here having lunch and every week you're talking to thin air. There's no camera, no mic that I can see and I'm pretty sure you're no crazy. So what's the fucking deal?""

I was the only patron on the patio, the morning a tad too cool for most. The blond haired man shrugged.

""Dunno, maybe because I can.""

I scoffed at that, taking a sip of my beer. 

""Yeah, but why here, why now?""

Again that unsure shrug.

""Because I can.""

I shook my head, my hair flickering in front of my vision. 

""That's not an answer, it's an excuse.""

He walked closer, leaning against the waist high fence.

""And what's it to you what I do?"" he asked.

""Fucked if I know,"" I said. ""All I know is that everything's got a purpose or reasoning behind it if it's a person doing it. You don't just wake up one morn and decide to talk to thin air. It was a conscious decision.""

He smiled at that, spreading his hands wide in mock surrender.

""You got me, friend. But it's still a secret.""

I smiled as I sighed and reached for my wallet, pulling out a fiver and slapping it in his hand, shaking it as I did so.

The bar of soap drops from my hands, and smashes down at terminal velocity on my left small toe.  I'd been in kind of a weird mood since last month, and I know depression can lead to mild auditory hallucinations, but I definitely heard this.

""Doing what?"" I winced through the throb of my pinky toe's indignation. ""That. Stop doing that. Stop talking directly to me."" the voice replied. ""...you started it -"" I stammer out in bewilderment. ""- I'm only replying to your demand."" 

Almost a month ago, I lost my job. Shortly after this, my girlfriend left and took my dog with her. Then, depression set in. Among many other efforts made to combat this sadness, I'll often talk to myself out loud. Last night for example, I had a 10 minute argument with myself standing in front of the open fridge over whether to eat the pizza left overs or zap a lasagna for dinner.

""You're an idiot."" a metallic, tinny voice continued from what sounded like behind the bathroom mirror. ""Your rendition of 'Party in the USA' would put Miley Cyrus to shame - and that's no easy task."" Now, the simple fact that anyone had overheard me singing Miley Cyrus alone to myself would be embarrassing enough, but the fact that this occurred whilst wet, naked, and presumably alone in my bathroom stoked the embers of my curiosity and of my fear. New York is full of strange people, and you always hear stories of people breaking into a home and setting up camp in closets and in attics. But since I have no attic, and the apartment as a whole could be considered a closet, I was all the more disturbed to consider the possibility that someone had been living here with me without my knowledge. 

""I knew someone ate the rest of that Cherry Garcia!"" I exclaimed, turning off the hot water knob and fumbling for my bathrobe. ""You have five seconds to get out or I'm calling the -"" 

""What ever are you on about? You don't recall your night out, coming home clown shoes and crying your way through the half pint you had left? That was our highest rated segment this week!""

""highest-rated"", I parroted. ""Segment?"" I put forth with adequate audible perplexion. I brought my robe into the tiny cramped translucent coffin with a garden hose the landlord had the gaul to call a shower... Fearing almost unconsciously the idea of my overweight body appearing live on broadcast - TV? Web Cam? I wasn't sure. Fortunately before I got a chance to give any more thought to this, I heard a crackling sizzling noise, and saw a flash of light come from the other side of the frosted glass of my shower door. The light danced around and through the mildew that had spawn on or around the floral patterns decorating the sliding glass door that no longer slid so much as jerked along in difficult to control bursts. As the light subsided, I could clearly see a short dark (purple?) figure on the other side.

""Please, stay where you are. This will only take a moment -"" a now clear, yet gravely voice declared. ""Now, you understand your contractual obligations, don't you?"" 

""Uhh..."" I managed to get out before -

""Ah. One moment."" The clouded purple figure spoke. I could detect movement, though I'm not sure what exactly happened. As best as I could tell, a limb raised almost as if this person were checking their watch. ""Benard? Please disable unit 297's memory suite for 45 seconds."" I hear a beep. Suddenly, I recall my contractual obligations.

When I first auditioned for Big Brother, I didn't fully understand how they were going to prevent the contestants from acknowledging the fact that they're on the show. Having been on air for decades now, I assumed there were only sparse aboriginal tribes that hadn't at least heard of it in reference. So when the producer told me about the new ""spin"" they were adding to ""freshen things up"", I thought maybe they expected us to act. Which I always kind of figured was a part of ""reality"" TV - we're all aspiring actors anyway. So when I was required to sign waivers for a surgical procedure that would implant a small device via laryngoscopy, I was very confused. In fact, the last thing I can really recall is my contract being read to me as the nitrous set in. 

""No breaking the fourth wall. Big Brother: Uncensored is all about maintaining the illusion that contestants are unaware of their participation..."" explained, one of the stipulations. 

""There - you should recall now. So, do you care to tell me why you've been doing precisely this? The subethernet is buzzing right now with fans complaining about your flagrant disregard for the fourth wall!"" the purple figure exclaimed, audibly upset. ""One more of these and your participation will be terminated, and you will forfeit your rights to compensation!"" it now almost yelled at me.

""BERNARD!"" the purple figure demanded. ""Open door 297.1.4, and terminate suspension of 297. We shouldn't have any more problems with this one..."" it hesitated.

""Should we?"" it almost asked me.",psy-fan

**December 31st, 2024**
Cecil D. Rodriguez, Michigan's Governor: ""In conjunction with 19 other state governors...provided no Union of American ideals shall assail civilians of the world...will secede from McDew's American Empire in the event he abuses our nuclear Arsenal..""

From *A Declaration of Civility,* a 2 page open letter decrying the policies of radicals in both parties. The other governors took 2 weeks to draft *A Declaration of Solidarity* calling these Northern governors ""Enemies of the state, willing to ally with China instead of their U.S. neighbors. They are not your neighbors."" 
;ndsp

I hope these quotes answer your question! Obviously the American Intracontinental Nuclear Conflict left the world's structures without its core leadership, and the first strike on China took them out of the equation for about 3 years. This vacuum set the stage for the Tigris Atonement Coalition, which saw the Two Rivers States and much of NATO move into the ravaged North American continent. Some war crimes trials are still being resolved from the 'Fallout decade.' (Kruschima, et al.)  
;ndsp
Although morbid, the Americans' sacrifice made the concept of 'Leadership Doom' apparent. Never again will a country display the arrogant ambition  required to assuming dominance over the world structure. To the fallen, glittering culture of the twentieth century: thank you for all you've taught us.

"[WP] ""Hey /r/askhistorians, what were the defining moments of the 2020's?"" Submitted 2116-03-28",chipwhitley63,"Hey, askhistorian longtime lurker here. Only posting because 2020's American history is my main study. Currently pursuing my 8 year term of information recovery from that era for the Northern Watch, so I might be able to shed some light on the subject. I actually just received my cloak, so I'm official now. You would not believe the archives they have available up here.

So the year 2020 itself started off with a roaring bang, as the countries formerly known as China, Japan, and South Korea, began to pressure one another. The United States- as it was still known back in that time, had shifted towards a trend of isolation. Not only had the great wall of our famous forefather Trump, been almost halfway completed to the south- the Northern Barrier was also being erected, blocking off the fierce wildlings from the Fragmented people once known as Canadians. 

Those of the Asia Pacific region came closer and closer to conflict over the next two years, but in the North American circuit, things were calm. Mostly. The Southern sections of those who dwelled within the great walls, began to feud with those to the far east and western coasts- sparking armed conflicts.

Great Leader Trump was still in power up until 2023- and used his influence to hold the coming aggression at bay until the final completion of the Southern Great wall. It was only then that the Great leader passed the mantle down to a successor, after losing his battle with hair-cancer.

It was then that the Second North American Civil war began, with those at the walls refusing to let people out, or in, to the county. We quickly found the automated defensive systems of our great land too powerful for any to resist, as the ever-vigilant drone striking armies of the sky eradicated any and all major zones of violence indiscriminately, and the great Scaled ones came to power, shedding their false skins to come out and rule openly. Under their wisdom and patience, no nuclear strikes were recorded in country- but as the separate conflicts of the Asia pacific region escalated the remaining outside North American military forces began to consolidate and withdraw- heeding the call of our people, and just in time.

Then began the Great Asian ""War of the Fish"" soon followed by the Dark ages of High-chance thyroid cancer and impotence. 

Really, society was ever shifted after the Scaled ones came to power, and though relics of the ancient ages still remain, our Lizard overlords have maintained peace through the lack of such commodities. Instead they bolster our great Walls to the North and South, and focus their interests on other projects, the likes of a mere Northern watchman, such as myself, will probably never know.

Though not a main topic of mine, I do have some records of what was occurring in the Great Northern county over the Eastern ocean region we now commonly know as the ""Land of Mohammad."" Back in those years, even into the late 2028 through 2034, it still recognized itself as what was called the ""European Union""- but that's another subject entirely.

[WP] You are a scientist who created an incredibly revolutionary invention that changed everything. This is your suicide note.,columbus8myhw,"*THE TELEPORTER'S MANIFESTO*


I'm a meticulous, careful person who thinks before they act.   


I thought I'd be hailed as a modern Prometheus.   
I thought cracking the code for teleportation would make  the world a better place.  
First off, you guys could easily solve world hunger. I mean, now you have the capability to instantaneously transport any amount of any *thing* any *where*! Plug 'food' into that equation, and *bam!*     


What was that big issue? 
Children are starving where? 


That's all it would take. (Aside from the actual food, of course.) Anyway, my invention could do *so* much more. People could visit their relatives whenever they pleased! Ever wanted to see the world? Here! *I gave it to all of you.* My personal favorite application of my teleporter: Stuck in a public place? Have to use the restroom? At the touch of a button, you're now sitting in your own bathroom at home, and you never have to use a nasty porta-potty or public toilet again.    


That goes for eating, drinking, *anything!* No longer are people inconvenienced by transportation. Hell, governments world-wide should turn all roads and highways into... I don't know, public gardens? You have so much more space! The practical and purely fun applications of my creation were endless.


I remember my first test of the very first prototype. I had a Rubik's cube I would never solve lying around, so I put that on the platform and set the coordinates to 1 foot above it's current position. I crossed my fingers, and hit the button.    
\*Pop!\*  It fell to the ground Westward, and from a much higher distance. Let me tell you, accounting for the Earth's constant rotation and revolution around the sun was a freaking nightmare. After that, it was simply a matter of streamlining the interface, getting biological materials through, and much, much trail and error.


Such was the birth of the modern Teleporter. It was *fantastic*. Before the sleek new design and friendly interface, I decided to be the first human to use my creation. I octuple-checked all the calculations and coordinates, made absolutely sure I wouldn't be erased from existence, found some wood to knock on, and held onto my butt. I said a prayer -even though I'm not religious- hit 'enter', and hoped for the best.


What happened next I still, to this day, cannot describe. It wasn't the first time something as big as I had been transported from point A (my prototype) to point B (the roof) via point C (the hole in space and time I had isolated), but it was the first time something as complex had gone through. Sure, I sent a Newton's cradle through to see how momentum translated (it turned out to be very well). I even devised a slow calculator to see if electronics worked (they did, and swimmingly). I'd tested things that emit sound, light, energy; I'd made a list over the course of a month with all the important things and how to test them.


But I was more than 'Point C' had handled thus far. Neurons firing, electric signals travelling throughout my spinal cord, DNA replicating- I'm still not sure if it was the relatively primitive machinery, or just my favorite hole in space-time adjusting to humans, but something... Happened.   
Not just the little tingly feeling you get if you'd use today's updated versions of my original device. Not just the vague, disorientated state you're in for that fraction of a second. This was some crazy shit.


I mean, I could smell *blue*.   


Not blue*berries* or anything like that. Pure, unadulterated *blue.* Fractions of a second later I heard it, saw it, and even tasted it! But most of all, I could *feel* it. 


You assholes who've used my invention might think you know what I mean here. You'll think back to that one time where you spent a 'solid second' in transport.    
*Ooooh, scaaAAAAaary!* 


Ten  
MINUTES.  


For ten *minutes*, I didn't really exist. Not wholly, anyway. You know that faint after-image of somebody after they teleport? You're not supposed to have seen that, as the Surgeon General warns about the dangers of 'Spatial Radiation'.   
*Complete and utter bullshit.*   
Anyway, because you've undoubtedly seen it, I'll continue:  
You know how after you look at a light for too long you look away, and when you blink, you see a sort of blurry ghost-image of that for a fraction of a second?    


That's almost exactly the same thing. That's where your atoms were, and the human eye just doesn't know what to do when they're just instantly somewhere else; possibly continents away. And I don't mean the fool's 'instantly', I mean it in it's true sense. The person or thing just dissapears. 


Nobody really cares about that part, but I've taken to calling it the 'elsewhere' effect. Anyway, when I released my invention -and *after* everybody called it 'impossible', called me 'crazy', and it was accepted by the world, I was eagerly anticipating the great change of... Well... Everything. 


I mean, who needs to text or call somebody when they can just warp through reality and talk to them, face-to-face?


Who needs to buy plane tickets or book a trip when you can just appear wherever, just because you feel like it?


Now, I had kept in mind the downsides and drastic disasters that my invention would undoubtedly cause, and had the foresight to restrict some locations or things that could be transported (weapons, drugs, y'know). 


From what I thought, it would all go well and the gradual integration of my invention in society would be looked upon by history as the next great revolution of, well... Everything.


And then people stole the concept, the technology.  
Thank god my devices couldn't be tampered with. However, the reverse-engineering of them was far too rapid for my liking. 


As soon as people got their hands on this frightening second generation of my device, it all went to hell. So eager to produce a cheaper knock-off, safety precautions were ignored. Contraband programming skipped.


Limits  
*broken.*


Many of the world's celebrities went into hiding after the first crazed fan warped into their homes.


More than just them, but too many innocent people became victims to the first wave of Teleporter-assisted homicides. Optimistic and opportunistic psychopaths abused the unapproved, bastard offspring of my invention to kill as they pleased, and immediately following their crimes, transporting home to their beds. 


People misused, abused, and ultimately raped my creation, like the terrorists who sent bombs across the globe, the bank robbers who warp into vaults and safely home with their ill-gotten riches before the alarms even went off.


I'm a meticulous, careful person who thinks before they act.   
The origin story of my invention should be a testament to that. 


I thought of every outcome, every flaw with the machine, and fixed it.  
It was ready to be welcomed in by humanity, and welcome in a new age with it.


But humanity was not ready for it.


I'm a meticulous, careful person who thinks before they act.    
This is the story of just how badly I failed.   
Just how badly I essentially killed those innocents.    
Just how badly I erased 'privacy' from our lives.    
Just how badly I failed myself, but more importantly my creation.   


If I can't fix it, if I can't redeem myself, I won't be able to live with who I am.  
Luckily, I have found redemption.   
Luckily, I have found the solution.   
  

You're reading this because it fell from the sky after that blue flash and blue noise. Thousands of copies like it are now in the streets, and hands of every citizen in every major city around the globe. 


No more deaths.    
No more impossible crimes or bombings.  
No more teleporters.    


All of them and myself have decided that we're going to make one final trip, one last visit, to our old friend point C, and we're not coming back.   
Sure, it'll kill me.


Luckily, I'm a meticulous, careful person who thinks before they act.   
And I've thought a lot about this.   ",Pieguy85
[WP] You are a scientist who created an incredibly revolutionary invention that changed everything. This is your suicide note.,columbus8myhw,"To Whom It May Concern,

1 year ago today I created it. Some call it a miracle, but I am no deity. Some call it bullshit, but they are just the minority that do not believe it. I call it The Connection. 

As most everyone knows, I was originally a no-name scientist working on broadcasting through space. Usually just picking up static with the occasional noise from space debris colliding with each other causing a frequency interruption. But then one day, later to be deemed The Day of Contact, I heard a voice. It was a faint voice speaking in German. Re-tuning the signal until it was clear, I jotted down the German phonetically to the best of my non-speaking ability. I took the transcription to a native speaker who informed me the voice spoke a bunch of wild details describing a vast wonderland filled with unworldly pleasures and smiling faces on everyone inhabiting it. 

Upon returning to my lab, I checked my broadcast to make sure I wasn't receiving interference from a television but I learned the signal was not coming from earth at all, or even our own universe. The signal was unable to be traced precisely but was discernibly farther than any human made craft has travelled previously. The more I explored, the more voices I heard. At one point they even became aware I was listening. There was a great roar of voices yelling then it all settled and one familiar voice spoke. This is when my research, beliefs, and religion all shifted permanently.

The voice was unmistakably Ronald Regan. My personal favorite president's face, his voice ingrained in my head, recalled the moment I heard it. He began to speak about how they are in Heaven. If you would have told me this would happen even a day ago, I would be the first and biggest skeptic, but for some reason his voice enveloped me with a soothing understanding. 

He continued to explain how wonderful it is there, how entering its gates has nothing to do with religion but just being a good person (thank god!), and they were expecting this signal from me but were not sure when. When I got my wits together my first question was... why is Ronald Reagan the spokesman for heaven. He laughed and explained they just needed a voice I'd recognize and figured Michael Jackson might not have been the best of the two candidates. He then elaborated how much everyones loved ones up their missed their family back on Earth. Then I realized how important this device was. 

After some time the media exposure snowballed and mass production ensued. The device was in pretty much everyones home globally since I made sure it was sold at-cost and affordable to all. The only complaint people had were the lack of pinpointing their deceased friends and family. The signal had no control who received it up there. Heaven was bombarded with signals as people spent consumed all their free time with their hand on the dial of The Connection.

Then came the mass suicides. The worlds population had been cut down to about 48% of what it was before my invention. People lucky enough to reach their loved ones found the rekindled connection too much and had to join them in the alleged beauty of afterlife. I did not feel responsible for their deaths. I provided them with a tool and how they use the information was up to them. These people to me were weak, why not just wait until your natural death to be together again? That was until yesterday.

My main drive to stay alive was to monitor and improve my device, making sure it works to the best of it's ability. I was up late in the lab alone, as I was almost every night. Using the new handheld model, The Connection X2, I heard a familiar cry. It was my daughter. She was crying, as she always use to, but I could tell it had more sadness in it then usual. She uttered softly, ""when's daddy coming?"" and a kind, reassuring voice responded to her. ""Don't cry Ally, daddy loves you very much, but he is busy. He is helping everyone back home!"". Caroline. My darling Caroline. The woman I loved that was taken from me so abruptly with our daughter in tow, too young to understand, on that rainy road, the worst night of my life. I broke out in tears immediately. Before I could respond, the new device, being a useless fucking prototype cut short as my tears fried an exposed circuit. 

I attempted to fix it to no avail, then tried many other models but could not regain the frequency. I spent all last night crying non stop, helplessly trying new machines and smashing them out of frustration when an unfamiliar voice answered, speaking an unfamiliar name. I decided there is only one solution to talk to them again and it doesn't involve these god-forsaken machines. 

Amy and Caroline, I am coming home today.

I can't take it anymore. The image that I have to uphold. The miracle drug I created, that has the ability to heal the any wounds or diseases you possess, is in too high of demand. I realize, that this should have been a good thing, but I only have a limited amount. I know what you're thinking, why not just make more and give it to the others to mass produce it? Well, if it were that simple, I would do it. 

I made the drug completely by accident. We were testing to find out why our body reacts how it does to certain things, and I must have added something by accident, because everything the monkey was injected with disappeared. There was no evidence that the monkey had once been a test victim. Everyone was in awe, but, they found out that I didn't know how to make more, that's when the death threats started rolling in. 

Everyday I get hundreds of emails and screams telling me that I'm a disgrace to the science profession, and they're right. I don't deserve to be a scientist if I can't even remember a simple liquid that I added to the formula. So they're getting their wish, I'll end it all. Then there will be more talk about the wonder serum and what it could have been.

It was the penthouse of a building just off Central Park, and looking out of the floor to ceiling glass windows she could see all of New York. It was a bit cold in the apartment - literally, but also the sleek white furniture and high ceilings made the room austere and brutal. She rubbed her bare shoulders and brought her short dress a little further down past her thighs.

Suddenly, hands wrapped around her waist. Delicate female hands, perfect as porcelain with long red fingernails. She felt lips press against her exposed neck, kissing lower and lower. Liz reached a hand behind her and felt the smooth silk of the woman's dress pressing against her own.

""Don't get started without me, ladies,"" the man said. He walked towards the two of them with a bottle of champagne. His name was Alan, and he was built like a professional athlete. Liz was surprised he'd invited her over with his wife. He was stunning.

His wife, Karrin, was even more so. A head taller than Liz, built like a supermodel. With more money than God, and more brains, too.

She was nervous. Karrin started lifting up her skirts. Alan got closer, placing his strong hands on her throat. She let out a soft whimper, but didn't stop him. Swingers could be kinky like that.

It happened so fast. Suddenly she was on her knees. The couple knew everything. Positions she'd never heard of: man and woman and man again. Words to whisper that made her squirm and release again and again and over and over.

Then she saw the glint of the knife, held in Alan's hands just above her. She screamed as he brought it down, never even leaving her, still thrusting, one hand on her throat.

There was blood. Blood everywhere, blood in her eyes and mouth. 

Then Karrin's limp body fell against Liz's exposed breasts, a knife wound gaping on her flawless back.

Liz screamed. She screamed as loud as she could before Alan's bloody hand covered her mouth, still inside her. 

""Shhh... Shhhh..."" He cooed.  

""She couldn't have children. Not like you, Liz. She was worthless.""

Alan smiled, looking deeply into her eyes. ""Come on,"" he said, almost romantically: ""We don't have much time.""

Christopher raised his head ever so slowly. With watery eyes, he stared at the blank wall. He couldn't murder someone, not directly. It wasn't in him. However, he knew one thing he could do.

Without looking, he tapped at his wrist monitor. He called Cheryl, he called his siblings, he called his closest friends.

That night, Christopher went to bed, sobbing.

They all met in the hospital room the next day. Room 47. He walked up to the woman in the hospital bed, watching her peaceful, wrinkled face. Her silver hair was a mess, as always.

She was asleep. It was easier. As he grabbed her hand, eyes wet, he saw past the oxygen mask at her face, as it was before disease hit.

The doctor entered the room, walking quietly but with purpose. ""Are you ready, Mr. Lewis?"" she asked.

Christopher only nodded, and backed away, reluctantly letting go of her hand. ""I'll miss you, Mom,"" he whispered out.

After a few minutes, the doctor pulled the plug on the patient. Everyone in the room was crying, except for two. These were the two that sneaked out of the room as everyone grieved. They found an empty hospital room. Christopher and Cheryl got in as fast as possible. As Cheryl stripped, Christopher locked the door, barred it with a nearby chair, and closed the curtains.

Neither of them were in the mood, but of course, that's what the pills were for. They quickly got into the motions, with no enthusiasm. Eventually, after a few minutes of the same repetitive movements, they simultaneously climaxed. They only felt guilt as they cleaned up afterwards and rejoined the others.

---
Over the next year, they could both only feel guilt. At three months, they had the funeral, where they could only think of the events that happened after the plug was pulled. At nine months, a child was born, a baby girl. She was named after the person who died for her; Madeline.",thelastflame50

It wasn't pleasurable or fun or even time killing. It was panicked and messy and desperate. Maxine made light grunts as he fucked her but nothing pleasant or happy or shouting like usual. This wasn't for short-term pleasure but for something important. More important than anything else. This was the only way their child would even get the chance to exist. Everything had to be certain and precise.

The old man was still lying on the floor nearby. His television still played on some music video channel. Blood spatters and bits of skull stained the carpeting. Some old song blared over the television:

*moving forward using all my breath*

Paul tried to ignore the old man's body and the bloody hammer and the TV and the pictures and everything else that wasn't Maxine. Her eyes, her short dreadlocks, her soft ebony skin, her breasts, everything about her. Maybe if he just thought about her and the child he wouldn't have to think about the old man or the pictures. It wasn't working but maybe if he just kept trying...

*there's nothing you and I won't do*

The pictures were the hardest to ignore. Those goddamned fucking pictures. The old bastard in them standing with his bitch daughters. Smiling like they knew the answer to every question. Like they were laughing at Paul for being stupid just like everyone else but Maxine did. The old man deserved it. He deserved it because he was a murderer and everybody knew it. The courts had said otherwise. Fuck them. Fuck all the liars and idiots who believed the old man and the lawyers and the ""witnesses"". He did it and he deserved it.

Maxine said it herself. ""How's it any different than the death penalty?! That piece of shit deserves it Paul you know he does you know it!"". The city council had promised that Paul and Maxine would be allowed to conceive once the old man was dead for killing that boy. Their switch would be flipped. The cycle would continue. Life for death, death for life. 7.125 billion people. No more, no less. The old man wasn't supposed to get acquitted. ""How's it any different from the death penalty?!"". Paul didn't know why but it felt different when the hammer went through the old man's forehead.

*I made a pilgrimage to save this humans race*

Paul tried to keep his eyes on Maxine's face. Looking directly in her eyes as he pumped into her. But his eyes gravitated, almost unwillingly, back to the picture on the desk behind her. The old man. The daughters. The smiles. Paul began moving faster. His thrusts grew angrier, faster, more fierce. Maxine's grunts and gasps grew louder and more high pitched. Soon she began shouting again. It was painful but the good kind of painful that made you want to be fucked even harder. 

Suddenly he exploded. His hand struck forward, smashing the picture apart. They both hit orgasm. He yelled. She let out a moaning yelp. Her nails dug into his back. He held his penis in her as long as possible, as deep as possible. There could be no chances. This had to be certain.

It was done soon. Had to be. Paul pulled out and began zipping his jeans. Maxine set her feet down, stumbling a bit, and pulled her pants back up. He gripped her hand. They hugged. Than they turned and walked towards the apartment door, making certain not to trip into the old man's corpse. The television kept blaring.

This has lead to thousands of young couples seeking someone to murder. But once their victim passes, they have to be quick... [NSFW]",politikamusic,"The room was just the wrong side of brisk. The chill on my skin reminded me that I *could* be comfortable if only there were another two degrees to be found. Fortunately it wouldn't matter for very much longer. I'd be gone in a few minutes. I had a job to do.

""Are you sure?"" she asked me. Her eyes were large and pleading. But her body language said she knew my answer. She sat halfway up in the bed, shoulders slumped, picking at a hangnail to distract herself. This was going to happen, and she knew it.

""Yes. We've discussed this--""

""I know."" She sniffled and laid back. Tears seeped through her struggling eyes. They flowed down her cheeks, then back down toward the nape of her neck, eventually disappearing into the fabric of her grey-blue gown. She didn't even try to wipe them. ""I know we've talked about it. I know we've decided. But I don't know if I can do this. It's too much.""

I looked down at the plastic cup in my hands. Four white, nondescript pills shuffled as I turned it round. Across the room sat our doctor, Karen, on a stool with wheels on the bottom. She was busying herself with some charts or paperwork or other boring but necessary trivial bullshit, trying to stay out of the way until it was time. Next to the bullshit was the important stuff. My samples, Karen's instruments. The stuff that would make this all happen.

""Don't you dare make excuses, don't you dare run from this. We both know the alternatives. We won't be part of them.""

Her head tilted down, to hide her eyes from me. I put the pills down on the armrest of my chair and slid next to my wife on her hospital bed, scooping her into my arms. I held her close as I fought my own tears.

I lost.

""I wish I didn't have to go. I love you so much..."" my voice broke. I kissed the top of her head, twice, three times, and came away with strands of her auburn hair stuck to my lips. I wrapped my arms around her as far as they could reach... it was insufficient to the point of torture. A deep breath and a throat clear to regain my composure... ""But neither of us are murderers."" I cracked again. More tears ran down my cheeks and into her hair. We both shook with my shudders as I struggled to control my breathing. ""You won't be alone. My family will be with both of you, and our savings will ensure you're both comfortable for a long time. Our child will have a good life. A loving home, security. Everything we lacked, and even more love.""

""She won't have a whole home.""

I had to grin in spite of everything. She had convinced herself we would have a girl. And she knew I wasn't so sure. She was teasing me with this tiny hope. Eight years in and we're still like schoolchildren pulling each other's hair on the playground. Even here, in our lowest moment, crumbling under the weight of inevitability, she'd bust my chops. ""God, I love you.""

Her teasing me was her way of letting me know she knew I was right. I took a deep breath to calm myself, and kissed the top of her head again. Time to go.

---

I sat back in the chair and nodded to Karen that I was ready. I looked back at the pills in the small plastic cup. A quick tilt and they were in my mouth... a small swallow and some water, and they were coasting down my throat. The resigned silence that had filled the room since I got up was punched through with Cris bawling. ""No! Nooo! Take it back! Spit them up! Please, please please don't go! Don't leeeave me!"" She bargained with me, with Karen, with God, with the universe, with anything that would listen, half gibberish broken up by heaves and spittle and shuddering.

The room slowly stretched away from me. I reached for my wife with one hand, but she seemed forever away. I cursed at everything that prevented me from holding her. My chest shuddered as I fought to breathe. I wanted to lash out, to shatter my knuckles on everything that brought us here. On the faces of every politician who ignored the warnings, every scientist who doctored research for money, every reckless farmer who sprayed their soil with everything they were paid to until it was as dry and useless as gravel. 

*Fuck these rules. Fuck these gene mods. Fuck everything. You're fucking ruining me, so fuck you and everything you cost me. FUCK.*

Karen materialized from the dark distance, walking toward me with strides that ate up impossible distances. 

I looked back at Cris as the lights dimmed. *I love you*.

---

Nothing in the clinic room moved for a moment, except the woman on the bed whose wails bounced off the walls like pinballing ghosts. Karen stood over the man's body, one hand holding his wrist and the other with two fingers jammed under one side of his jaw. A moment later she seemed satisfied, and gently put his arm on the rest. She turned to the woman, ""Cris, he's gone. I know this is hard, but it's time and we have to move fast. I need you to do this, I need your help."" Karen retrieved her stool, some samples, and instruments from the far side of the room and took position at the foot of the bed.

Cris's legs moved like a woman beaten and left for dead, unable to do more than half-motions. Slowly she slid them into the stirrups. Karen nodded, ""Let's make this baby happen.""

""What is it?"" his face askew with confusion.

""It practically tells me when you are about, uh, you know.""

""Oh""

I smile at them, such a perfect couple, strong, dependable, ""You'll make great parents,"" I say as I look towards the hut I had bought for them. They gave me a warm embrace before walking towards it. Turning towards my rowboat I leave without another word leaving my mouth.

A few hours had passed, I lay back in my rowboat reflecting on my time on Earth. My life was filled with failures. From my inventions to my love life, but in my sea of despair, I met Alan and Georgia, the only two people that never turned their backs on me and so I was happy to end my life, so they can bring new life. The watch starts flashing red slowly, so I put it on, press the button on the bottom and feel the cold sensation of metal rods sliding into my skin. ""The last time I'll feel pain.""

Just my two cents. Great take on the prompt though. I had imagined that these people had to kill in order to get pregnant, but I think your interpretation is better. Committing premeditated murder just for the opportunity to get pregnant is hard to justify, but a woman who is in labor? Whose then-living child is still kicking and warm with a fleeting chance at life? It makes for much more compelling storytelling.

Ben had a forkful of his Saturday morning scrambled eggs halfway to his mouth when he paused at Ann's words, looking at her. For a moment, his eyes lost focus, but then he snapped right back, smiling at her.

""Of course. It's time, isn't it?"" He took the bite and gestured Ann to come closer. Visibly relieved, but still tense, Ann pulled a small card from her pocket. It glowed with a soft plasma light, clear and malleable in her hands. She swiped at it and tapped the compact screen a few times before handing it to Ben and sitting beside him, pushing her long brown hair behind her ear. 

""It's my ovulation calendar. It says I will have a two hour window this evening at 9.""

Ben nodded, scooping his eggs into his mouth. ""Do you want anything to eat dear? We'd best be off quickly, it's nearly 11 in the morning now.""

Ann declined and rose, trembling with excitement. Being young and ambitious, Ann and Ben were already dressed for the day in their soft cashmere and expensive but comfortable jeans. They wore earthy, generous soles on their shoes that covered heel and foot and lived in a large house with a three car garage, fully supported by Supercore technology.

Ben spoke aloud, but not to Ann, ""Start my car, Sorana. And would you please place my plasma card on the table by the garage door?""

""Of course, Ben,"" a soft female voice replied from the house.

The fully automatic car was given a destination to a Supercore Family Planning Center near the outskirts of the city, close enough to where they lived. They walked hand in hand through the large glass doors and straight to the woman sitting behind a gently lit plasma enclosure. She sat and her name tag said, ""Wendy."" She positively beamed at them.

""Welcome to the Supercore Family Planning Center,"" she greeted cheerily. Ann could not help but smile shyly back. Ben stepped a little more forward and greeted Wendy with the same enthusiasm she showed him.

Before Ben could speak, Wendy put her hand out – the plasma screen around her allowed her hand to escape. ""Plasma cards, please,"" she asked in a friendly tone. Ann and Ben both produced theirs quickly.

""My wife's plasma card says she's ready to ovulate today and we've been thinking about having a little tyke for a while now. I think today is the day.""

""Oh, short notice?"" Wendy teased, turning to insert their plasma cards into an enlarged screen. ""We do require you to be married for at least one year, but I see that's not a problem. Happy five year anniversary!""

Ann smiled and nodded, looking around at the pristinely clean room carefully colored in pastels. Her attention was pulled back when Wendy slid their plasma cards back to them over the counter and pointed to an opening wall to their right.

""Her name is Beryl. You'll find her information uploaded to your plasma cards. She's very old and very frail, and she's been quite ready to go for awhile now.""

Ben breathed out a sigh, relieved. ""I'm so glad you take such good care of your people,"" he commented. Wendy smiled at him, nodding in agreement.

""We only allow the suffering to perish, that's the Supercore way!"" Wendy pointed again to her right, looking a little past Ann and Ben as another well-dressed couple had walked in. ""You'll find a bag with a few items to assist her on her way out, just there. Thank you and have a wonderful day, and best of luck with your future endeavors!""

They moved out of the way of the other couple. Wendy repeated almost verbatim her regular spiel, but Ann and Ben both felt relieved by her friendly and open exterior. They moved to retrieve a black bag that was hanging from the open space in the wall, which quickly and quietly closed as they turned away and went to their car.

Ann pushed her plasma card and the windshield lit up. Beryl was an elderly woman in her 80s, 88 to be precise. Sorana calmly described her life and its accomplishments, a woman who grew up in a military family with several brothers, who all passed, and who had outlived her children. She did not suffer from any medical or mental health diseases, but the loss of her children had caused her to be mostly a shut-in. Supercore put her address into the navigational system and asked Ben and Ann if they wanted to travel there. They looked at each other and smiled, both saying yes simultaneously.

---

They were delivered to a quaint farmhouse that was far outdated but well-maintained. It was evening time and the sun had just begun to sink. They had donned on the gear from the black bag, previously deciding they would do the deed together: two helmets, two chest pieces, and a jumpsuit for each with generous pockets.

They did not anticipated their uses. The black bag also contained a suicide kit. They wished to ease the woman's suffering, not enhance it. They would give her the doses of medicine and approximately 23 minutes later, would place the plastic bag that would deprive her of oxygen until she passed, looking at the colors of the rainbow. A very peaceful passing.

Ben approached first, Ann following closely behind him.

""Why are there no lights on?"" she commented. Ben shrugged a little and gave her hand a small reassuring squeeze.

""She might be asleep is all,"" Ben said.

When they approached the porch, Ben knocked firmly. The porch light flicked on just as his knuckles made the third and final knock.

---

Wendy sat at her desk, slightly bored, glancing at her plasma card every now and then. The time was showing in the top right corner. She was almost off work, but first she would need to go up the elevator and do her reports. Then she would walk to the fifth floor by the stairs (because she was getting just a tad thick around the thighs after her third child), and get a new plasma card, one of the larger ones. She was rather excited for that. 

It had darkened considerably outside, and quickly, with the recent time changes. She was energized anyway as it had been a rather busy day and she enjoyed working with people. It was when the waiting room was quiet was when she became restless.

Wendy shifted and a pen dropped to the floor. When had she been using a pen? Those were rather archaic. She bent down from her seat to pick it up, looking at the tip. That didn't look like ink.

Wendy screamed when she sat up, completely startled by the elderly woman standing before her. She placed her hand over her heart and then shook her head.

""Dammit!"" she said, glaring at the woman before her. The woman stood tall and strong, with long silver hair that had darker streaks of gray in it. The woman was scowling at Wendy.

""I am alive, Wendy. Have we not been over this?""

Wendy, still trying to catch her breath, nodded, but then shook her head. ""I can't help you Mrs. Stinson, when you appear on the list, you appear on the list.""

Mrs. Stinson rolled her eyes and threw her plasma card down with a loud clang. It was an older model, with a thin metal frame. It flickered when Wendy picked it up, who gingerly cared for it and plugged it into her bigger plasma screen.

""Dammit,"" she muttered again, her cheeks red. ""I knew I should have manipulated it.""

""You're god damn right you should have manipulated it, Wendy. They were like soft bunnies. Didn't even try to put up a damn fight. Oh, right."" Mrs. Stinson threw down two more plasma cards, newer ones. 

Wendy looked at her and sighed, dragging them to her. 

""Where'd you put them, Beryl?""

""Under the tree like all the rest. Stop sending them to me, Wendy. I'll die when I am damn ready to do so!""

With that, Beryl turned on her heel and marched out of the building. Wendy looked at the ancient plasma card and rolled her eyes. She set to ordering Beryl Stinson a new plasma card to be sent to her house. Or maybe she'll just send another couple there. A tougher looking set, though.

[NSFW]",politikamusic,"Alexis began loading the gun as James first thrust into her.  Thrust-click-thrust-click.  It was like clockwork.  They had planned this all out months ahead, to ensure that nothing could go wrong when they finally felt they were ready for a child.  

They had found the man at a bar.  He was sitting alone in a corner, resignedly nursing a half-empty beer bottle, with several empty ones already on the table beside him.  Alexis had worn her old jean shorts, frayed in so many places that her panties were actually visible through them, and a crop top that left very little to the imagination.  She had spent an hour on her makeup, making herself look as sultry as possible.  She had approached the man in the corner (whose name she learned to be David), and had quickly seduced him out into the alley behind the bar.  At that point, James had come out from behind the dumpster and covered David's face with a chloroform rag, before zip-tying his wrists and ankles, gagging him, and dragging him to the trunk of their car.  

Now he was bound to a chair in the corner of their bedroom, the floor and walls around him covered in plastic.  As perverted as it was to have him there during their lovemaking, it was necessary, as it was the only surefire way to conceive these days.  As Alexis moaned, David began to stir, groaning and lifting his head.  He saw what was happening, the gleam of metal in Alexis's hand, and quickly began to struggle, as the new rules of life were common knowledge.  

""Hurry James, our friend is waking up!"" Alexis said.  James grunted and thrust again, two, three times, and Alexis could tell he was nearing his orgasm, so she cocked the gun.  ""Now!"" James shouted, and as she saw the felt the first blast of seed fill her womb, she fired directly into David's heart, killing him as James' finished blowing his load into her.

Two weeks later an excited squeal came from the main floor bathroom as James set the table.  ""James!"" Alexis shouted, ""It's positive!""  James rushed to the bathroom, and Alexis showed him her positive pregnancy test.  ""That's great, baby"" James said, wrapping his arms around her.

I always finish the job."" That was Yorick's motto, and because of his efficiency and speed with which he responded to job offers and carrying them out, he'd become a very wanted man. A very wanted man to both the law and couples desiring to have a child.

If it wasn't for that bloody, genetically-programmed rule, he wouldn't even have a job. He thanked God every time his phone rang and a man or woman on the other end nervously asked him about his rates. He never did it for free, not even when the voice on the other end was a woman already in labour. He'd later read in the papers she had killed herself after the child had been stillborn.

His current job was clean, relatively speaking. He'd been contacted well beforehand by a couple living in the country. They already had a son, but they desperately wanted a daughter. Yorick had gone out and bagged a meth addict downtown, tied him up and put him on a chair with a bag over his head in the couple's basement. He'd stayed with them for two days before Martha's water broke. He waited until the contractions were less than a minute apart and then descended the stairs to the basement. He checked the addict's pulse to make sure he was still alive, then checked it again ten seconds later to make sure he wasn't.

Yorick donned his coat and came into the living room, where Martha was being tended to by her husband John, who was a physician, and a local midwife. The cries of the baby made him smile. John saw him and took him outside, into the hallway. ""I can't thank you enough,"" he said, ""we will love our new daughter as much as our first.""

He didn't need all this, but knowing he helped did always make him feel better. Loud, adult cries from the living room alerted the two men, and John hurried back to his wife, Yorick closing the door behind him after he entered. He looked around. The baby was wrapped in a blanket on the table, crying. The midwife was gone.

""What's wrong?!"" John asked her, grasping her hand.

""It's not done!"" Martha gasped. Her breath was rapid. ""I'm having twins!""

John's eyes went wide. His entire body froze when he heard a *click*. Slowly, he turned around to face Yorick. The hired man held up a gun, aimed at his head. ""No..."" He muttered, ""no.""

The asteroid loomed ahead, dark and ominous, scored by countless impacts over the millennia. From the bridge, Jaqueline Sinclair could just make out the United Nations prison colony, its unassuming glass domes and jetties gleaming in the cresting sun.

Beside her, Captain Guerro puffed absently on his pipe, sending whipping tendrils of blue smoke twirling and dancing into the vent above. He was tense, like the rest, and Jaqueline could almost hear his thoughts churning.

Their target was somewhere in that prison. Whoever wanted him freed had paid handsomely, and had answered no questions. They were provided with a prisoner number and a brief description, nothing more.

“Arrival in thirty minutes, Captain” said a pleasing, English baritone from a speaker on the console. “Thanks, Arthur. Bring us to a stop,” the captain replied.

The UNS Odessa responded, groaning slightly against the shifting momentum as the forward thrusters flared. 

“What do you think, Jackie?” the captain asked, not taking his eyes from the viewport, “fast and hard, or slow and steady?” Jaqueline chewed her lip. “I… hmm… how are their defenses?” The captain nodded. “Hey Art, can you show us the schematics again?” “Yes sir,” came the reply.

The asteroid disappeared as the viewport shifted opaque, and was replaced by a complicated diagram of the prison facility. Eighteen levels, all but three below the surface, ran through to the core. Jaqueline and the captain leaned closer. “Sir” the speaker piped, “I have identified fifteen anti-vessel rail cannons arranged in a near-complete field of fire. Direct assault is not advised.” In response, several yellow circle appeared over banks of vicious, long-barreled turrets. 

“However,” Arthur continued, “it would appear that there is a blind spot near the far side of the asteroid.” Another yellow circle. “If we were to approach through this blind spot in the shuttle, we could land undetected and infiltrate on foot.”

The captain scratched his chin. “I don’t know, Art, I’m not feeling a spacewalk.” Beside him, Jaqueline nodded, unconsciously rubbing a slick patch of synthetic, off-color scar tissue along her forearm, a bitter reminder of their last attempted surface infiltration.

 “In that case, another option presents itself, sir,” said the voice from the speaker. “It would appear that we have not yet been detected, and based off of a perfunctory scan of their systems it seems they are far out of date. It might be possible to forge artificial identification.”

The captain smirked. “You saying we walk in the front door?” There was a pause before Arthur continued, “In certain terms, yes.”  

The captain turned to Jaqueline. “What do you say, Jackie, feel like some fast talking?” Jaqueline grinned. “Always, captain.”

Captain Guerro pushed himself off of the console. “Alright, let’s do it. Arthur, prep the identification, warm up the shuttle and grab a body. Jaqueline, get suited up. And wake up Wallace, we’re gonna need him on this one. And no guns, were in and out.” With that, the captain strolled off the bridge to his own preparations.

---

An hour later the crew was assembled in the shuttle bay, Arthur’s meticulous plan fresh in their minds.

Jaqueline flexed in her new suit, its matte black armor weave responding to her every move like a second skin. The collapsible blade concealed across the small of her back was heavy and reassuring. Beside her, the captain was similarly armored, but he hid his time-worn and battle-scarred suit beneath a long black trench coat. 

Wallace looked every part a UN official, his usually greasy, unkempt grey hair combed and parted, dressed in a sharp black suit over his own armor. “You clean up pretty good, Wallace,” Jaqueline chided, to which Wallace replied with his usual harrumph. 

Last to enter the shuttle bay was Arthur. He had downloaded into an imposing, silver frame, nearly seven feet of gleaming armor panels, and had printed the UN crest over his breast. He handed each of the crew a similar patch. “These will function as badges,” he explained, “and they should get us in the door. Just stick them to your chest and they’ll heat-seal on.” Jaqueline peeled off the adhesive strip and pasted the faux-badge over her heart as the other crew did likewise. 

Arthur made a round of inspections, nodding to himself, touching up collars and straightening Wallace’s tie. “Good, we should blend right in. Remember Wallace, you’re a representative with the Peacekeepers and we’re your retinue. If anyone get suspicious, get in their face. Peacekeepers are not known for their long tempers.” Wallace smirked.

Arthur turned faced the captain. “And in case anything goes wrong, captain, I’ll have the shuttle ready. Just say the word and I’ll get her primed for a quick evac. Good luck, all of you.”

With that, Arthur gestured to the shuttle, and the door slid open.

---

The small shuttle coasted in nuclear silence towards the waiting jetty. The identification had worked, after a few choice words from Wallace, and they had been granted permission to land. As they drew closer, the prison towered before them, its glass paneling reflecting the stars beyond.  They could see guards milling about on the upper stories, dozens of guards.

“Remember,” the captain whispered, “no guns, no mess. We’re here for observation. We’re looking for prisoner number…” he checked a small readout on his forearm, “127-3094. We get in, find him, plant the datamine, and book it. Any questions?” He looked from Wallace to Jaqueline, and each only nodded in turn. “Right, let’s do this.”

Arthur, behind the controls, brought the shuttle to a slow crawl into the docking bay. Magnetic clamps snaked from the walls and anchored the small craft, each connecting with a reverberating thud.  A gangway extended from the wall, slowed, adjusted to account for the shuttles position, and sealed against the hull. There was a slight hiss, then a green light flashed over the sill.

The shuttle door slid open, revealing a long, narrow passage. The trio stepped out, and the door closed behind them, Arthur remaining at the controls. Assuming their preplanned disguise, Wallace led the way, walking with a curt, sharp stride, the heels of his tall boots clacking against the metal grating. Captain Guerro and Jaqueline fell into place beside him.

They passed through the airlock without a sound. Wallace fidgeted nervously, and the captain elbowed him in the side. Steeling himself, Wallace took a deep breath and cracked his knuckles reflexively. The inner airlock door slid open, and the trio were assaulted by a repugnant wave of damp air, heavy with the smell of body odor and grease. 

A slight young officer stepped out before the group, bending into a low bow. “Welcome, sir,” he only addressed Wallace, “and might I say, it is quite an honor to have one so… so important as yourself.” Wallace grumbled, nodded to the officer, and pushed his way through into a small reception area. 

“Uh, sir, my apologies, but the warden of this facility would like a word at your earliest convenience,” the officer continued, “would you mind following me to the command center?” The officer searched Wallace’s grizzled features for any sign of acceptance. Finding none, he laughed awkwardly, sidestepped, then shuffled over to a side door. “Right this way, please.”

The three mercenaries followed the young officer through a maze of corridors and stairwells until they arrived at a set of ornate double doors. “Right through here, sir. And, might I ask that your… bodyguards… wait outside?” Wallace shot the officer a menacing glance that brokered no debate. “They come with me,” he said.

The doors slid open, revealing a room surrounded by monitors. Several officers, dressed in the black jumpsuits of the UN Peacekeepers, flitted about the command center, and in the center, seated on a low plinth and facing away from the door, sat one of the fattest men that Jaqueline had ever seen. 

Wallace cleared his throat, and the warden swiveled around. “Ah, hello my friend,” he said, his voice deep and booming, “welcome to my prison.” The warden made no move to rise from his chair. “What do I owe this honor?” Wallace cast a quick glance at Captain Guerro. 

“Well, we were in the neighborhood and thought we’d make a pit stop, see how things are going” Wallace said, thinking on the fly, “and we could use some real food, I’m tired of that synth crap.” The warden laughed. “Say no more, my friend. Come, let us dine! Then I can have an officer show you around to your heart’s content.”

The warden punched in a command into a terminal and the chair lurched, rose on unsteady gravjets, and descended from its mantle. “Don’t mind the chair, sir,” said the warden as he floated up to the trio, “I was wounded in an accident some years ago, lost the use of my legs.” The immense warden motioned them to follow, and he bobbed and weaved through another side door and into a lavish dining room.

Exclaimed Tuco. He had imagined heaven in his halcyon days, but such pastoral infatuation was blunted by the pubescent sea change marking his untimely death.

Heaven used to be a vast white expanse like the salt plains of Bolivia. Sirens perambulating toward Heaven's newest initiate, Tuco's legs spread wide, arms akimbo waiting for his, er, *christening*.

Instead, he greeted a far different scene. His brother, Tacho, antedated Tuco's death by some-ten-odd years. Tacho died after he gorged himself onto a steel rod protruding from the base of a grain silo. He and his friends used to clamber to the top and jump in, against their parents' wishes. The fear, you see, was of drowning in the grain. When Tacho failed to return, they knew he had drowned.

Presently, Tuco greets Tacho, ""Yippee-Ki-Yay, muchaho! Guess the big man couldn't give you a new soul case for that hole in your chest!""

""Ah, dearest Tuco, I never thought I'd see you again.""

""I never thought I'd see *you* again, Tach!""

""Listen, Tuco. Er. Let me put it to you this way ... There's been a bit of a mix up.""

"[WP] You have the power to freeze the world around you, do whatever you want, and then unfreeze time. However, if you fall asleep at any point, time will suddenly unfreeze.",semen_biscuit,"Obsession.  An idea or thought that continually preoccupies or intrudes on a person's mind.  She was right.  That pretty much sums me up at this point.  I know she wants to spend our time together and forget about the future, but I just can't let it go.  If she knew about me, what I can do, she would understand.  I feel horrible leaving her to lie there all alone in her hospital bed when she gets really bad.  I know she thinks I'm not there for her and that I have other things on my mind.  The truth is, she's all I think about. 
 
About a year ago, my girlfriend was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis which means that the body's immune system starts to attack itself.  It can cause inflammation and painful swelling or even attack her organs if it gets too severe.  It can be treated and most of the time she can live a pretty normal life.  Other times she gets severe flares where she has to be hospitalized.  I can't stand to see her like that.  She looks and feels absolutely miserable and no matter how much she wants me to be there with her, I know holding her hand is never going to make the pain stop.  No amount of emotional support will cause her body to stop attacking itself.  I have to do more.  I can't just sit there and let her suffer. 
 
I never imagined using my ability for the greater good.  I found out at a pretty young age that I had something no one else has.  I could will time to stop.  Manipulating those around me became so much easier.  I was a star athlete in school.  Freezing a game to check the other teams play or dodge a tackle kept me at the top of the top.  Sure it wasn't exactly fair to halt everything and untie someone's shoelace only to step on it at a critical moment seconds later, but it made me the most valuable player we had.  Not to mention I was an ace student with all those answer sheets I slipped out of bags and desk drawers.  My projects were elaborate and always deemed an A after the extra time I had to spend on them.  I earned myself a full ride through Harvard and again was at the top of my class.  I made sure to keep myself from being *too* prestigious with intentional mistakes though.  I wasn't after that kind of attention.  I just wanted life to be easy. 
 
Yep.  Easy.  That's what this power, this ability, was supposed to do for me.  I could have my choice of just about any woman out there.  My standards in college were pretty low.  As long as she was attractive, I didn't really care about her personality or intelligence.  I just needed someone to hook onto my arm and fulfill certain... *needs.*  Then one day I met her.  Kristine.  She had curly chestnut hair with reddish highlights when I first saw her.  She was hunched over on a bench outside of Harvard with books, binders, and papers piled up in her lap.  I think I noticed her legs first if I'm being honest.  I wasn't exactly a great person up until that point.  Following her warm skin up to her skirt with my eyes, I never really expected to feel anything more than lust.  When I got to those curls I felt something different.  It was so unfamiliar that I remember almost avoiding her.  She looked up at me and gave a shy smile before looking down at her papers again.  I found myself feet were moving me closer to her before I even had a second thought. 
 
""Excuse me,"" I called over.  I was confident and friendly in my approach after all the practice I've had.  ""I see you're busy so I don't want to take up too much of your time, but I was hoping you and I could go get some coffee when you're free."" 
 
She looked shocked as I took a seat next to her on the bench.  ""Um.. I'm sorry, but I've really got too much to do,"" she stuttered out, focusing again on the work in front of her.  Almost irritated by her disinterest, I watched her pencil as it bounced back and forth along the page in front of her.  What could be so consuming that she wouldn't even give me a second look?  Most girls were approaching *ME,* not the other way around.  ""I'm Eric McNeil,"" I said confidently, holding out my hand.  She took a fleeting glance at my hand, then right back to her work.  ""Ashley,"" she muttered out.  It was the worst introduction I had ever experienced.  I pulled my hand back and crossed my arms in front of me.  ""Come on,"" I said in a mocking, but friendly way, ""Don't tell me you'd rather sit here and do English homework than make a new friend?""  Her eyebrows furrowed a bit.  I was annoying her.  *I* was *annoying.*  Since when?  ""It's not English,"" she stated plainly, ""It's archaeological science.""  Archalogi-what?  Is she serious?  ""I can help you with that,"" I blurted out without thinking.  This got her attention.  Her full attention.  She put down her pencil and actually looked up, staring me in the face for the first time since I'd noticed her.  ""You can,"" she asked skeptically, raising an eyebrow just slightly.  Great.  I can't back out now.  ""Uhh yea.  I mean if you wanted.  I took the course already and passed.  I could take a look at it if you wanted.""  Still skeptical, her eyebrow raised a little higher as she wordlessly handed me her papers.  I looked them over and pretended to know what I was looking at.  What I was really doing was scanning for keywords.  Important bits and pieces so that I could freeze time and learn enough to seem knowledgeable.  Thank god for smartphones because I really didn't want to have to walk all the way to a library and do real research to pull this off.  I stopped everything around me.  Ahh.  The feeling of being in complete control.  Safe and at peace.  It had become so familiar that freezing time was like meditation to me.  I slipped my phone out and did a quick search.  Before unfreezing,  I paused to look at her.  There was that unsettling feeling again.  Never had it invaded my personal space like this.  I was always at peace when I stopped time.  Something about her was different.  Maybe that's why I was acting so crazy.  The rush of time flowing by again was exhilarating as ever.  I had learned just enough jargon to convince her I wasn't lying.  ""Tell you what,"" I said cheerfully, ""I'll help you, but only if you meet me for coffee tonight.  You can bring your work if you want and we can talk about it then.""  She bit her lip, turning my offer over in her head.  Adorable.  Faking further annoyance, she agreed to meet me.  I strutted away, feeling good, and suddenly remembered I now had to learn as much as I could about arche-whatever by eight tonight.  Good thing I wasn't just anyone.  I'd have plenty of time. 
 
Spending time with her changed me.  I didn't want to keep lying to her.  I spent less and less time outside the borders of time and more watching it tick away with her at my side.  After seeing her two or three times, she sporadically announced that she had been lying to me.  There was no way she could be keeping a bigger secret than I was, but I pretended to be concerned.  In a way, I was almost relieved.  It helped me justify the lies I had already told her.  ""My name isn't really Ashley,"" she said as if she was ashamed of herself.  ""It's Kristine.""  Reflexively, I laughed.  ""Don't laugh,"" she half shouted, ""I'm serious!""  I smothered myself down to a chuckle and apologized.  ""I.. I lied when I met you because well...""  She shook her head and turned away.  ""I'm sorry.  I should just--""  She started to walk away.  ""Hey,"" I called, grabbing her arm, ""Where are you going?  I'm not mad.  Why didn't you tell me the truth from the beginning?""  She turned back, blushing lightly, ""Well..  I uhm... I kind of thought you were just some jerk trying to get in my pants.  I only went to coffee with you because I *really* needed help with my work.  Then I got to know you and well..  I realized I was wrong about you.""  God if she only knew that everything she knew about me *EXCEPT* my name was a lie. 
 
I had never committed as much time to anything as I had to her.  She made me see what it was like to actually live as a part the world as opposed to living with the world around you.  Time with her couldn't be extended.  She lived in a world with a finite amount of hours.  When time was up that was it.  There wasn't another option.  No forty extra minutes for breakfast in the morning.  No three hours to do that thing after class so that it could be done before dinner time.  I found myself helping her with her work a lot.  She took strange classes, but it seemed to make her who she was.  Somehow our relationship lasted throughout the rest of our time at Harvard and continued on afterwards.

"[WP] You have the power to freeze the world around you, do whatever you want, and then unfreeze time. However, if you fall asleep at any point, time will suddenly unfreeze.",semen_biscuit,"Things were great until she started having these unexplainable pains in her hands.  She used her hands a lot, sculpting and drawing all sorts of crazy looking things.  Her passion was archaeology.  Miniature bones and ancient looking pottery she had hand sculpted herself cluttered the desk and shelves of her apartment.  She had all sorts of scribbles and drawings in multiple half filled sketch-books.  I suggested that maybe she was overusing them and she slowed down on her hobbies a bit.  Over time the pains got worse and worse.  They spread to her elbows, then her shoulders, and kept going still.  That's when we learned she had RA.  It crushed her.  We were in our mid-twenties and everything she had been working towards was being ripped away from her so early.  Her body was destroying the tissue and bones in her joints.  She would never be able to handle a real dig.  The pain and inflammation would be too intense and would cause her bones to erode that much faster.  I wanted so badly to grab her and freeze time for both of us.  I wanted her to never know that kind of defeat.  Here I was taking the easy way out my entire life and reaping the benefits every day while she poured herself into one goal, one passion.  She put her soul into everything she did and played by all the rules and yet here she was.  It wasn't fair.  If only I could do something.  I tried to freeze us.  I tried to take her with me to that place of peace I had grown up in.  She was crying as I wrapped my arms around her.  Everything stopped around us.  For a second I hoped it had worked, but when I pulled back and looked at her face, the misery was there.  Frozen in time with the tears that streaked her beautiful face.  In that moment, I vowed to use my gift to do something right for once.  I had to find a way to help her. 
 
This is when she stopped understanding me.  She would never know how insane I was making myself.  I spent days within days looking for information.  I went back to school to get a medical degree just to be able to prove myself knowledgeable.  Med school was easy of course, but it was tiring.  I knew I couldn't waste any time.  I had to find a cure for RA before it was too late for her to follow her dreams.  I couldn't watch her lose everything while I continued to easily achieve whatever I needed.  I would stay frozen for bigger lengths of time as the days went by.  After pushing myself for too long I dozed off at my desk one night.  I woke up and continued working, not bothering to look around.  Wait.  Why is the light on my phone blinking?  That shouldn't...  *3 Missed Calls*  WHAT???  Never before had time unfrozen itself.  I had slept from late yesterday evening all the way until eleven the next morning.  So much wasted time.  I can't afford to waste time.  I don't understand how this happened.  It had to be.. No.  It was. 
 
In the past I never pushed myself very far.  Most things didn't take much time to do without any sort of distractions or interference so I had never kept time still long enough to need sleep.  That was the difference.  That was the *only* possible thing to cause a change.  If I sleep, I can't maintain it.  Time unfreezes as soon as I fall asleep.  It was then that my obsession became unhealthy.  I started drinking absurd amounts of coffee to stay awake.  Terrified of wasted time, something I had never dealt with before, I forced myself to be conscious for ridiculous stints of time.  This caused some issues once I did finally sleep because I was so hard to wake up.  I started to miss appointments, was late or absent from scheduled meetings for lunch or dinner with Kristine, and lost track of the days so badly I never remembered birthdays or holidays anymore.  I'm not sure why she put up with me for as long as she did, but eventually started to give up on me.  I brought her flowers as an apology too many times.  Sorry only works so many times. 
 
Looking back, I should have been there for her.  At the time I felt like I was.  Everything I did was for her.  Every thought about her.  It was all *her.*  In my obsession I lost track of her.  I lost track of us.  I poured months upon months into fixing her, but all I was doing was making her that much more alone.  I may have had time to do what I needed, all the time in the world sink into this frantic search, but she didn't.  She lived in a world where time was a fixed, finite thing.  Her day to day was all she had and I was missing it.  Now it's too late.  Today I woke up to a voicemail on my phone.  She had given up on voicemails a while ago because of  how many she had left me before.  Instead she would just text me what I had missed.  This weekend it was, ""Coffee shop near campus.  8:00pm.  I waited.""  Our anniversary.  It came and went without me and that was all she could handle.  I had rushed over to her house to make it up to her, but she wasn't home.  I knew she didn't want to see me, so I had just went back home.  Staring at the new message icon on my phone, my heart started to sink.  I knew what this message was.  I didn't want to hear it.  I didn't want to acknowledge it.  I froze time, holding my head in my hands.  The peace of having all the time in the world had long left this cold, still state of being.  I dialed my voicemail, turned on the speakerphone, and set my phone down beside me.  Her goodbye was cold and painful as it played through the tiny holes in my phone.  She was better off without me.  Better without me causing her unnecessary emotional pain alongside all the physical ones.  She was always better off without me.  I've always been selfish.  Always done things for myself and no one else.  I vow to find a cure for her.  If I do one thing for someone else, it will be for her.  Whatever it takes, however long, I will do this for you Kristine.",FrowsyCompromise

_____________________________________________
*Shit shit shit. Think! Think. What the fuck am I going to do?*

I ran my fingers through my hair frantically, accidentally pulling some out in the process. I shook it off my hands and it hung limply in the air.

*I need time! Time. I need time to think.* 

In some sense all I had was time. As I paced back and forth along the edge of the cliff the world was grey around me. This gift of mine had become more of a curse. 

*Damn it. SHIT.* 

I tried to calm myself down with deep breaths. My hands were shaking. I could feel the beads of sweat dripping down my forehead. *THINK.* 

I steadied myself against the trunk of a massive tree and I could feel the deep grooves of the bark against my palm, freezing cold as if it was made of metal; literally frozen in time. The air hung like a heavy grey fog around me and I had to keep reminding myself to move so that I wouldn't suffocate. I looked at the pale skin of my hand, saw the veins pulsing in it; a vibrant display of life against the dullness of the timeless world around me. A reminder of the burden I now held. 

I was only a child when I first discovered my ""gift."" I'd been playing a game of ""don't touch the sand"" tag with my older brother on the playground at school. The swings were close enough to the bottom of the slides that you could just barely jump to the first one if you angled yourself right. I'd made it to the bottom of the slide and was about to jump when my brother slid down behind me, kicking my legs out from under me. I remember vividly, trying to grasp for the swing chain that was just out of reach, knowing that I was going to fall flat on my stomach, closing my eyes, waiting for the impact, but deciding in that same instant that I didn't *want* to fall. It was such a silly thought, who actually wants to fall? Whatever brought it to mind, when I opened my eyes I was floating gracefully downward towards the sand in a sea of grey. The air was thicker and somehow had a greyish tinge, like what I imagine life would be like living in rain clouds. 

""Hey! How did you-"" I'd turned to ask my brother, but he was stuck with his leg in the air near the end of the slide, shit-eating grin plastered across his face- the look of triumph that he always had when he was about to beat me at something. His whole body was motionless, as if he were a sculpture mounted to the end of the slide. I'd touched his skin, which was so cold and lifeless it sent a shiver down my spine. I'd thought *I don't like this* and the world had sprung back to life in an instant. My brother had screamed in confusion; questioning me furiously as to how I had ended up standing next to the slide instead of face down on the sand where I should be. I had tried telling him in earnest that I didn't know and I couldn't tell him, but he never believed me. 

At first I'd thought it was only possible for me to control time when I really needed to, but as I'd grown I'd found that I could decide for myself when I actually *needed* to stop time for a bit. 

About to get beaten by my high school bully? **Stop.** Walk ten feet away. **Start.** Enjoy his confusion and walk away unscathed. 

Forgot lunch money? **Stop.** Help myself to a pre-packaged meal. **Start.** No one would ever know the difference. 

Didn't do my homework? **Stop.** Copy the answers from the class genius. **Start.** Watch my grades slowly turn into straight A's.

Oh no, a *timed* state test. **Stop.** Grab a soda, grab my tablet, surf the web for answers. **Start.** Look busy while the clock ticks down. 

It was all innocent enough, until I met her. The reason I was regretting every decision that had ever brought me to this moment. The reason I could hardly control my anxiety. The reason I felt the pressure of time like I had never before in the entirety of my life. 

She was, quite simply, perfect. She was everything I'd ever dreamed of. She had long golden hair that just brushed her shoulders, a smile that lit up the room and bright blue eyes that never betrayed a hint of malice. I gravitated to her and I thrived in her presence; she asked nothing from me other than to be myself. Because of that, I would do anything for her. Anything I was capable of.

I never intentionally kept my ability from her, I just didn't want to upset her. I didn't know how exactly to tell her without coming across as insane; merely saying ""I can stop time"" comes across as at least mildly delusional, to say the least. So I never told her. 

Instead I showed her. 

We were walking along the river bank that cut through the center of the small town we lived in. The sky was slowly sinking to a deep purple, the last remnants of the pink sunset burning in the distance as we walked arm in arm, her head resting lightly against my shoulder. I was lost in the moment, the scent of her hair mingling with the beauty of the day's end. I couldn't imagine a happier moment in my life. 

""How do you do the things you do?"" She'd asked me, glancing up into my eyes. 

""What kind of things?"" I asked her, a knowing smile dancing on the corner of my lips. 

""Oh, you know, things."" She'd motioned her hand in a lazy, dismissive gesture, as if *things* was explanation enough. And honestly it was, I'd known exactly what she'd meant. 

""These things, can you tell me more about them?"" I'd stopped walking and given her a quizzical look, all the while trying not to laugh. 

""You *know.*"" She'd smiled at me. I couldn't help smiling back. 

**Stop.** I picked daffodils from the side of the path, then a few sprigs of lavender and some blue bells from near the river. I arranged them in a neat little bouquet and stood across from her, her beauty as enchanting in muted grey tones as it was in color. **Start.** 

She'd jumped with surprise at the appearance of the flowers, but didn't say anything. She just looked at them and at me, then smiled. And I knew that she understood. 

 At least I thought she did. 


Everything changed one night. In a second the girl I'd loved was gone, replaced with a hollow shell of the person she once was. Her eyes seemed fade from their vibrant blue to mottled grey, as if time for her had stopped and would never start again. 

Her family had been driving back from somewhere, whatever it was I never found out, and they'd never made it home. A drunk driver had collided head on with them and they'd all been killed on impact. Her brothers, her mother, her father, all gone in an instant. And she was only alive because she'd decided to stay with me instead. 

Somewhere in the darkness of the days that followed, through the mourning and well wishing of family, friends, and strangers, she'd decided that this could all be fixed. That *I* could fix it. 

This morning she'd left a note, *Meet me at our spot. XO* The cliff was our favorite place to waste afternoons together, laying against each other on the trunk of some tree telling stories or napping. Sometimes we'd even brought a picnic with us, stolen wine and drank until we were laying out underneath the stars. I'd hoped that she was healing. Maybe this was a sign of her coming out of it, but I was wrong. When I'd gotten here she'd demanded I save them. *Go back in time, you can figure it out.* She'd yelled at me as she backed closer to the edge. *You're the only reason I'm alive right now! I should be dead, I should have died. If you can't save them then I don't want to be here.* I'd tried to reason with her. I'd begged, pleaded. *Please don't. Please.* I'd reached out for her as she backed further away. The tears streamed down her face as she stepped back once more, falling out of sight. 

**Stop.** 

And here I was. *Why didn't I stop sooner? Why. Why why why.* If only I had stopped her when she was still standing in front of me. If only. 

I looked over the cliff, she was maybe ten feet from the edge. Out of reach. And even if I could reach her I didn't know if I could hold onto to her once time started again. The momentum she'd already gathered would still be there. 

I couldn't get help. Getting help would mean I'd need to ask for it and I didn't have time for that, since she was already falling. I couldn't grab onto her without falling myself. I couldn't catch her at the bottom, it was too far of a fall. I stewed in indecision. *I have time,* I kept telling myself. *I just need to concentrate.*

I felt the helplessness of an eternity stretch on as I sat in the silent grey world that surrounded me. Nothing came to mind. What felt like days passed, but only for me, as that moment was preserved in time around me. I stared into her stone eyes, begging her for an answer. *I wish that I could turn back time, I really do.* 

Defeated, I leaned against the trunk of the tree and decided that if I couldn't go back, then I wouldn't go forward. This moment, this would be my purgatory. Forever. At least this way she wasn't dead yet. At least this way I could lie to myself. 

I didn't feel the world as it fell away, as it fell away from me and I was caught up in dreams of blue eyes and blonde hair, vibrant sunsets and endless nights lost her arms. When I opened my eyes to the cruel blue of a midday sky, I screamed. 

I knew that she was gone. ",Burymeth

"[WP] Four rainforest cafe employees try to make it to the end of their shift concealing the fact they're playing a new board game they just found called ""jumanji""",slightofhand1,"""Behind!""

Jim pressed himself up against the wall of the corridor as Daniel swooped past, several live and pinching lobsters affixed to his shirt.

Jim stared, mouth agape.

""Uhh...""

Daniel turned around swiftly.

""What?"" He interrupted, impatience evident in his voice. ""I have to check on table 17, I haven't been over there since apps went out, and that was..."" he paused, scanning the walls. ""At least 1 hour ago,"" he mused.

""Why is your hair all wet?"" Jim managed to squeak out the question.

Eyes glittering, Daniel grabbed Jim's wrist and, with his other hand, pressed a slightly heavy item against his palm.

""You'll soon find out. Or maybe you won't... it's your roll,"" Daniel finished, rushing off to the restaurant floor with his lobsters in tow, a brackish water flying from his hair.

Jim looked down at the carved stone die in his hand. It was smooth and warm and felt almost alive, somehow.

He took a deep breath. ""What a weirdo,"" Jim exhaled, tossing the die, which rolled to his left to land on the number 7.

Suddenly the hallway lurched.


Jim jumped slightly, stomach turning. What just happened, he wondered, rubbing his eyes. 

He heard a roar, which was odd, considering the animal noises aren't piped through the service hallways of the restaurant...and as far as he knew, the recording didn't feature so many mosquito sounds.

He slapped a hand against the back of his neck.

""Ow!"" Pulling his hand to his face, Jim saw a purple smear of his blood intermingled with the pulpy body of some unfamiliar insect. ""What the hell is this?""

He turned around, feeling a warm breath on his neck, and saw the path behind him-- which usually led to the bathrooms and manager's office-- was suddenly a muggy, hot swamp. 

A voice came on over Jim's earpiece.

""Dude, Jim! It's your turn! Have you rolled the die yet? Table 3 needs more water,"" Daniel's voice crackled in his ear.

"[WP] Annoyed by the lack-luster performance of superheroes everywhere, a villain masquerades as a hero to show them how to do it properly.",thecoverstory,"&gt;The problem with Superheroes these days is that they are tied down by a code of conduct, or impeded by their morality. They waste time on trivial things like, ""Save the girl or save the city""...and when they choose to save the collective, they brood over the the girl in a cave allowing the world to fall back into chaos through neglect, or they flip out and cause a civil war. They may be heroes, but they are flawed, emotional, weak. All heroes have a weakness, and every masochist needs a sadist. 

&gt;As for us villains....well, some of us are driven by our own madness...or dogma....or ideological greed. However, with that taken into consideration, are we really that different from our hero counter parts? Are we not the yang to their yin? Would heroes still exist if we villains ceased to be? No. You see, they need us. They need us to do bad so they don't look like monsters with unstoppable power. They need a justification to exist. We give them meaning. We are that sadistic justification.

&gt;Me? I just don't care. I can do bad. I can do good. But, I am neither. Unbiased, amoral, apathetic. I do what I do because I either want to, or because I can. I have the capacity to murder, and I have the capacity to save lives. It makes no difference to me. I am not in this for self gratification. I am not driven by a goal, a plan, or an ideology. I do it for the lulz.

His arm was pointed directly at the villain before him, preparing his orchestra of weaponized robot musicians.

The power-armored conductor grinned through his visor, raising his cybernetic sword over his head. ""You can't stop me or my mechanized orchestra of death!"" He declared triumphantly.

Don looked back at his other members. There was the Boston Creamer, a coffee-themed baseball bat thug who had defected to the good side. Then there were the Cerberus Triplets, a trio of identical girls with varying personalities and hellish powers dependent on proximity to their sisters. And finally, there was Don's right hand man, Dextros, whose hands could detach and perform amazing magical feats.

""Maybe. Maybe not. But we'll sure as hell try!""

Mecha-Maestro's mask smiled wider. ""Try is the operative--""

Suddenly, a streak of blackness, of nothingness, tore through the blade of Mecha-Maestro's sword, curved sharply and then ripped open his back, exposing his power supply.

""*What?*"" the Cerberus Triplets exclaimed in harmony.

Mecha-Maestro fell to one knee and revealed the figure looming behind him.

""Nightmare!"" the Boston Creamer spat.

The ebony, six-foot-six figure spared him a glance before turning his arm from a curved blade to a clawed hand and tore out the heart-like device that powered Mecha-Maestro's suit.

""Why?"" Asked Dextros. ""Why are you helping us, Nightmare?""

The creature of darkness looked at the Power Squad with baleful red eyes. ""**Your team is... pathetic. I will improve upon your efforts to defend this city.**""

""How do you plan to do that?"" Don asked.

Nightmare placed the power core to his face, and it split open, swallowing the device.

""**A 3-step process. Step one:**"" His arm swelled and morphed into a shape like a rattlesnake's head, the mouth glowing with energy as the power core surfaced in his bicep.

""Who the bloody 'ell are you?"" The hooded man asked, the gun not moving. ""And why do you have a picture of a dog on your top?""

""Because, you fiend, I am GodMan!!!"" He paused for a moment, then slowly looked down at his top, fist still raised heroically. He coughed in an embarrassed kind of way before hissing out of the corner of his mouth, ""E.A.R! Get over here!""

""No. I can see that now, thank you."" GodMan huffed. ""Evil Assistance Robot my arse."" He straightened back up to look at the highly confused shopkeeper and would be robber. ""Now, where were we?"" He looked down again as E.A.R tugged on gold spandex pants. ""What is it E.A.R?""

""Now I think about sir, was GodMan such a good choice of name?""

""Well, it's the usual type of egotistical nonsense these superhero types usually go for, right?""

""Good. Now."" He turned back to the robber. ""Freeze you knave!""

""Or what?""

""Or this!"" GodMan drew his Destructobeam... sorry. His 'Beam of Justice', and quick as a flash, caught the robber in the chest with a blast of energy that left a pair of smoking boots and a robber shaped hole in the solid brick wall behind.

""Well."" The shopkeeper blinked. ""Thanks I guess.""

""Not a problem my good man."" GodMan grinned. Then he levelled the Beam of Justice at the shopkeeper and switched his voice to a low growl. ""Now, just be a sport and empty the contents of the till into a brown paper bag.""

"[WP] ""Hello"", spreading her arms, she asks innocently ""Could you all please kindly die?""",AllHeilLelouch,"Rachel was ten that day. Many of her classmates and relatives have gathered to make a big party out of the Sunday. 

“Sweetie, go on, make your wish.”

“I can wish for anything?” she asked, eyes wide open in delight.

“Yes sweetie, but don’t say it out loud or it won’t come true.”

“Alright Mum.” She spread her arms wide like an invitation for a hug, and closed her eyes in wonder and focus. In her mind she said, *Hello, could you all please kindly die?*

My éclair slipped off my fork, bounced off my plate and landed messily on the floor. As everyone clapped to the sight of the sweet little girl blowing off the candle, I was squatting on the floor trying to clean up my mess and make some sense of the situation.

Their thoughts reverberated off the walls of the room as she maintained everyone’s focus. Collectively, what they felt was: *Oh, what a sweet little girl.*

They had no idea.

The cake was cut and given out to the guests. As everyone dispersed into smaller conversations once again, I shook my head to clear myself from the distraction of murmurs of their thoughts. 

I approached Rachel’s mother, who worked with me. I remarked pleasantly about what a nice place she had and how smoothly the party was going. But really, it was a gateway for me to talk to little Rachel.

She was entirely focused on her slice of the cake, making a slight mess of cream on her lips.

“Happy birthday Rachel.” I smiled at her.

“Thank you mister,” she smiled radiantly, right back at me.

“Are you enjoying your party?”

“Yes! I love it when so many people are smiling!” It was the truth.

“And the cake is nice too,” I remarked.

“Yes!” She replied, her attention returned to the remnants of the cake on her plate. She fed herself another mouthful.

*Everyone is so happy now. But when the party ends, Mum and Dad are going to start fighting again. Everyone is going to get sad. Just die now happily. I hope my wish comes true.*

“Rachel?” I squatted down to match her height, folding my arms across the table to test my chin on.

“Yes mister?”

“It’s alright for people to get sad or angry sometimes, you know? Life is worth it regardless of these.”

“Really?” 

“Let me tell you a secret. I am an expert in people’s secret anger and sadness. I have a gift. So trust me on this, alright?”

“Alright! I have to tell you a secret as well, to make us even.”

I smiled. “Sure.”

“I have a gift too. Whenever I squint my eyes shut and focus really hard to make a wish, it always comes true.”

Beside me, there was a loud choking noise. 

“Oh, it has started.” Little Rachel smiled to herself as the first man fell to the floor with a thud. I reached out toward her but I only found myself sinking further away from her. My body had gotten much too heavy.

My own train of thought was getting incoherent, coupled with the frenzied thoughts of everyone in the room as we died.

I looked up from my plate, unsure if I had heard what I thought I had. Sure enough, Lilith, the nights key speaker was grinning maniacally at the podium. Sighing, I looked around, hoping against hope that I had misheard. People around the room were dropping dead of natural causes. Or at least the most believable causes. A few heart attacks, a stroke, two men choking on their stake. Such a waste of good beef, I was going to have word with Lilith about not wasting food like that again in future. Oh, two men had a stiletto each, buried up to the sole, in an eye, that was different. The owner of the shoes, gouging here eyes out, harsh.

Looking back to my food, I despair momentarily, there is neither enough time to satisfactorily observe the carnage, nor to finish my meal. I clean my face with my napkin, before standing. I appear at Lilith's side before i have fully stood, and take her arm. 

""Come daughter, we must go before father gets wind. Lord knows how angry he will be at us causing such a stir, and after such a long time."" I allow myself a grin at my own joke, while Lilith besides me rolls her eyes. 

""Just because your a dad, doesn't mean you have to make dad jokes.""

""You should hear Gramp's, God knows his are bad.""

""I'm going home, and I'm going to my room to think about my mistakes,"" Lilith looks at me, shaking her head. ""And once you've got this out of your system, then you can come tell me off for ruining your meal. Ok?""

""Sure..."" I say to air as she vanishes. Looking up, I hear thunder. Lilith was right to go, and so I to vanish home.",Shadow_Proc
"[WP] ""Hello"", spreading her arms, she asks innocently ""Could you all please kindly die?""",AllHeilLelouch,"By the time Bella realized what was happening, it was too late. She had spent so much time wrapped up in her boyfriend's words, had spent so many nights staying up to listen to him passionately speak about what he believed in, that when the time came for him to ask for her help she said yes without even thinking.

Rostam told her everything that would happen, right then and there. He was four years older than her, a college senior who had studied political science and whose copies of the *Bible* and the *Quran* and *On the Origin of Species* lay face down around his apartment, their spines scarred from weeks of the same treatment. 

Her doubt was soothed by his words and careful planning. He showed her the notebooks full of what would come of her acting out for him. He serenaded her to sleep with thoughts of revolution and how to right the wrongs of the past. 

When the day came, he peppered her face with kisses and told her not to look as her pulse throbbed. But when it was done, and he kissed her softly on the lips and told her what to say, told her how she would be remembered forever as the face of everything, she nodded once. She took his hand in hers, squeezing it gently as she mouthed the words that her dry throat couldn't manage. *Thank you.*

She walked into the towering building, her muscles aching from the items strapped to her torso. She stood until people stopped to stare at her, wondering what she was doing there.

""Hello,"" she said innocently, spreading her arms and showing them what was underneath her jacket. ""Could you all please kindly die?""",232C
"[WP] ""Hello"", spreading her arms, she asks innocently ""Could you all please kindly die?""",AllHeilLelouch,"Bella was a good girl, a sweet little thing, adored by both our family and friends. My wife and I had raised her to be the best. It was easy, especially because we were both raised in strict homes with strong role models. 

We taught her manners first, then how to respect others and show kindness and love. I would watch whenever we visited somewhere and make sure that Bella hugged everyone, greeting with ‘Hello, how are you?’ 

But then an atrocity happened to our family, Aunt Maria had passed on. 

She was mugged and stabbed by a street thug, a boy with a poor upbringing who had been living on the streets at sixteen. 

When attending the funeral, I heard the other adults lie to Bella, they told her all kinds of fluffy tales: Aunty is sleeping, she’s gone on holiday, and she’s having a rest . . .  The onslaught of lies came one after the other. Gritting my teeth and listening, I waited until we got home to tell my sweet darling the truth. 

I took her to one side and said, “Bella, darling. Aunt Maria has died, she was attacked by a bad man with a knife and she won’t be coming back anymore.” Puzzled, she gazed at me with big eyes. “Did the man hurt her dad?” I nodded, “When a person gets hurt real bad they go on, into the afterlife. They don’t stay here anymore. . .”

Watching her, she scrunched her brow, her little mind filling in the details. She nodded at me, “Thanks dad.” 

Smiling, I ruffled her hair, “It’s better for you to know, darling.” 

“Aunt Maria is safe now, right Dad?” 

I nodded, “That’s right.” 

She ran upstairs to play with her dolls, I threw on the soccer, feeling a weight lift off my shoulders. I made it my sole responsibility as her father to tell her the truth - excluding Santa Clause and the tooth fairy - it was best that she knew. 

I dozed and when my eyes opened again there were garbage infomercials on TV. A yell echoed from upstairs, my wife dropped what she was doing in the kitchen and we ran to my daughter’s room. 

There sat my girl with her toys in a circle around her. Poking a knife into each toy and screaming, “Hello, could you all please die?” 

Running to her side, I snatched the knife from her hand. My wife covered her mouth as she walked in after me. 

“W-Why where you doing that Bella?” My wife asked. I collapsed, holding blade in a shaky hand. 

Bella looked up at me with big puppy eyes. “I just wanted them to be safe. . . With Aunty Maria.”

I gulped, knowing full well what she meant. 

Glancing down at the wounds in each toy, I felt ashamed. 

Maybe there are some things kids don't need to know, from that day on my mind was changed.

They will be the first to implode, but we have enough time to escape through them. Maybe.” He informed us. We looked at him, with disbelief, or anger, or simply nonplussed faces.

“Thats your plan? Oh my fucking god, this is how we die.” Shouted Acro. Sutton gazed back at us, unfazed by our passions, and replied “It is the most viable option, and every moment you waste disliking it you increase the chance of failure. So, follow me.” 

And we did. Because all there was to say was “fucking Sutton,” and trust his instinct. Lord knows it had kept him alive through events which any real mortal would have died in. But that was Sutton, he was the enigma among enigma’s. We crawled our way through tunnels, thanking god for Key’s eye in the sky, disabling as many traps as he could along the way. We were at the end of the tunnel. 

Key’s voice crackled over the line “Wait! Someone has to open the door at the last eletrical stand, about a hundred meters back in the tunnel. This won’t work, we need another route.”

“Damnit, there isn’t enough time” shouted Sutton, “ This is my mistake, I will go open the door. Frankly, this will be a great escape. The final escape.”  

“No. I will do it,” I said, and before anyone could object, I explained. I explained why the man had said I didn’t need a mask. How the explosion had changed me once, and the surgery once again. My true face has been hidden so, so long. I yearn for it to be free again. And I finally understood, why that man did what he did that day. Why gave up his life to help someone trapped in a world he did not like. He did not die to escape, he wasn’t cowardly. He was brave. He wanted change in his world, and he made sure he did change it. I don’t think he knew  how much it would influence me, but that wasn’t the point. He made a point of facing the world head on, he did not hide himself or his values behind a silk curtain. I was tired of my mask, i was tired of running from the world that had hurt me. I crawled toward the electrical station, turned to my compatriots and said, “I wear my mask no longer…” Then I flipped the lever, destroying me yes, but along with it the evils that had haunted me and my home, taking from the world what they had no right to. Finally, I could stand true and proud. What good is a mask if it obscures who you are? Not just what you like like, what if the facade you carry eats away at you? Then has it done anything? No, It is better to show your real self and be punished than cram the real you away, leaving it to die, forgotten.
And although i knew was about to physically die, I felt my soul rise from its ashes, like a Phoenix. This job was completed, and we would all be truly richer at the end. There was a brief searing pain, but this felt like a burning absolution, the pain carried with it a legacy.

"[WP] ""Oh, but she doesn't need a mask."" Turning towards her, ""You're already wearing one"", he smiles.",AllHeilLelouch," Then I was lost again, jagged flashes, like a slideshow running way too fast. A young girl, captured by Taliban fighters. Screaming as they forced their dirty, bloodied bodies on her. Pleading, saying she would do anything to leave. A more refined man, with eyes that had an evil charisma, and a hatred bred and molded over years came in. He said, “You may escape, but only if you wear this vest, and sit on the train we provide you tickets for. That is your escape.” He smiled at me, as if he was presenting me with an honor, and not a suicide to escape a short, miserable life as a sex slave for cruel men with crueler intentions. I did what I had to do. I took the vest, I took the tickets. It wasn’t the killing of innocent people that made me try to double cross. This was in the war-torn ghettos of Herat, and compassion was not a viable trait for survival. No, it my my own life. I thought, I did not live through poverty and starvation and oppression for this. Well, I didn’t think that then. All I knew was that I wanted to live. So I got on the train. I knew there was an electrician who kept it running. I found him. 

I stammered “s-sir.”

He turned to look at me, his eyes a warm nutmeg, surrounded by a smiling face. Until I took off my overcoat, and he say the sausage like links of explosives strapped to me.

 “ Please, I don’t want to die, I don't, I want to live. This wasn’t my choice! Can you help me?” I pleaded. His eyes met mine, filled with a sadness. He looked disillusioned.

“ Yes, I can. You must do exactly as I say. Do you promise?”

“I do.” I whispered. Then, he grabbed my hand, leading me to the back of the train. I usually hated it when men grabbed me, for it was out of lust. But his hands were warm, dry, and strong. They were a working mans hands, and I trusted them. Finally, we were in a small room, filled with wires and cables.

“This vest, it is designed to explode the moment it is taken off, or triggered remotely. I will be able to fool the sensors just long enough for you to dive out of the door, away from the explosion.” I assumed he would be jumping with me. I was wrong. He was unhappy with the world he saw around him. He didn't want to be a martyr, he just saw a way out of this cruel life that happened to help another downtrodden person along the way.

 “Ready,” he asked, then without waiting for a response, “ 1...2...3..”

Suddenly, I saw a blinding flash of bright light, and I was back in the arms of Vet. “It’s ok,” he said “Acro’s got another few minutes down there. Then we bundle up the goods, and hope to hell Sutton’s got a plan for egress, because according to Key we’ve got about seven minutes before this all goes tits up and we have to start shooting.” I tried to take in my surroundings. It was clear to me now. This italian Villa was a facade, but not for a bank vault to protect valuable art. No, it was a bunker to protect valuable leaders to the cause, those who used one man’s Jihad to further their station in life. Perhaps Rasul himself would come here, on a private jet, paid for by money from pillaging his own people's towns, protected by Saudi power and influence. Cause no matter what you value, you still need Saudi oil to run your machines, to keep your army rolling, and your economy prosperous. Over the mic, Key’s voice said “ Guys… you might wanna get ready. Head towards the vault, meet Acro and Sutton, and get out as quickly as possible. This whole fucking house is set to blow if the security measures are tripped and the guards trigger it. Must be some sort of self-destruct. I wonder why they have that…”

There were five of us sitting in the room. We were being briefed, it wasn’t the first time I had done this. The target: an Italian Villa on Pompeii, rumored to have one a large, priceless collection of art. Works of Van Gogh, Rembrandt and Monet, pieces by Salvador Dali that had never seen the light of day. Picasso, and Kahlo, locked up, hidden from the eyes of the world. Of course, I didn’t care about this. Art was just art. It didn’t help me until it needed to be relieved from its current owners. When that couldn’t be done legally, I was called on. I thought I knew all the players in the game, at this level in the black market you don’t know anyones names, what their faces look like, or their family. But, you know the real them. You know how they react under pressure. You’ve depended on each other when you're lives are on the line. There is honor among criminals, especially those of us that serve together like soldiers.

I don’t like it, this sounds all wrong. Too much money. I mean, for that fee we could be breaking into Fort Knox.”

I replied “The fact that he was able to even access us all means this is fuckin’ real. You ever seen Vet actually listen during the presentation? You ever seen Key hold his hand up to ask a question about the security measures?”

This seemed to satisfy Acro. He was quite a character. He was born missing one spinal cord, and had an unnatural flexibility. Vet, pretty self explanatory. He was a soldier. Served in Vietnam. Got picked up by the CIA. He’s overthrown democratically elected republics the world over. He says he couldn’t take it anymore, so he ran off. But he can’t live on the grid, lest the CIA return to him with some questions then throw him out of an airplane. So now he runs Special Op for art thieves.

Key’s brow furrowed at something our host said. I had never seen that before. He broke in, “I’m sorry you said there are multiple Big Brothers?  And a… how many tons is the door? Do you know what it would require to get through that door? And even if we could the Big Brothers would have gotten plenty footage of us, and alerted the security measures. I assume you’d like to avoid that.” He looked like an emo Mark Zuckerberg, with his hilarious Guy Fawkes mask. I think he wore it partly ironically, partly so people would underestimate him, and of course it was made of a material that did not come out on clearly on security cams.

One of us had said nothing up to this point. His name was not eponymous like ours, but a toast to all those who have escaped what they were not meant too. Prisons, poverty, drugs, death.  Sutton, after a famous prison escape artist. He was shrouded in the dark corner of this room, only a pockmarked wrist, covered in an italian silk shirt, from which a dark hand emerged, loosely holding a Sherman cigarette. 20 dollars a pack, hand rolled in New York. The sort of vice only someone who hates living and their money, but needs to make money and live well to prove to their past child-selves who were always told they would be nothing, beaten down but refusing to give up, preferring bitter success to easy failure. He flicked the butt of his cigarette into the venetian carpet, stifling the spark from it with a stamp from his bespoke shoe.",hughwhatthehell
"[WP] ""Oh, but she doesn't need a mask."" Turning towards her, ""You're already wearing one"", he smiles.",AllHeilLelouch,"“Who are you?” He rasped. At this, our host feigned surprise. 

“I am just the mediator, I will merely skim some cream off the top before returning the goods to the individual who entrusted me to procure your services.” He grinned at us, his smile strained, too broad.

“You are the procurer, yes, but you are no middle man. This transaction will end with the pieces in your hands.  Grant me but this curiosity: Are you a lover of the arts who will wear a black hat, or villain who wants to take that which his neighbor loves?” Sutton inquired. 

Our host, previously all smiles and convivialities, displayed a blank face now, but his tone conveyed authority, and he venomously hissed “ Do not concern yourself with anything other than acquiring that which I have paid you to get me. Will you do as I say or will you not?”

Knowing how little Sutton cared about his own life, not to mention the lives of those around him, I thought it wise to intervene. “Look, this is just a big job, and we want to be sure we are as thoroughly prepared as we can be, with all appropriate knowledge at our disposal.” I interjected.

Our strangely menacing host plastered a smile back over his reptilian face, “I would not be paying you two million dollars each, and not give you the best opportunity of success would I? That would just be a bad investment on my part”

So, drawn in by the promise of a small fortune, we began. Acro began planning his route through the labyrinthine house and security measures, Vet and I were doing thorough reconnaissance, noting the schedules of guards, looking for weaknesses that could be exploited. This particular Villa, while stylishly facading as a home, was categorically an impregnable bunker. Sutton skulked around, talking to his many high-level contacts, supplying us with information that was extremely exclusive. Usually, neither terrorist rings, cartels, or military intelligence agencies had the info that Sutton had accessed, through whatever means were most convenient to him. Key was locked in a hotel room in the village below the villa, going apoplectic whenever interrupted. “I’m about to break the most cryptic vault ever invented, if you don’t have cocaine you can fuck off!”

Slowly, I accumulated all that Acro, Vet, Key, and Sutton would need to complete their parts in this operation. Now it was time for me to earn my money. I had to synthesize the needs of these massive egos, force them to cooperate, and destroy anything in my way. I was known for my lack of compassion when carrying out missions. My orders to burn entire buildings with the guards inside had earned me another nickname. Mrs. Scorched Earth. I never thought it was funny. Those “Mrs. Earth” competitions didn’t even have shit on me. You’re using your sexuality and talent to gain equality for women?  Knitting is useful, good for you, but I’d rather get my piece of the pie by stabbing the owner’s eyes out then garroting him with the twine.

 About a month after meeting with our host, we had a plan to present to him. We drop onto the back balcony, Vet and I take out three guards. Acro follows us, then drops down a small ventilation staff, and comes out in the underground portion of the house. He places the device Key is devising right now on the vaults electronics, and waits for them to give up the fight, allowing Key’s machine to swing the door. By this time, alarms are raised, we are expecting egress to be harder than ingress. This, this,  is why they pay Sutton the big bucks. No one on the face of the planet can take a two dimensional map in his head, account for the likely actions of the guards, owners, and local and national law enforcement, then come up with a viable escape option. It leaves more variables up in the air than I normally like, but if there is anyone one I trust to juggle variables and keep us alive at the same time that man is no doubt Sutton.

"[WP] ""Oh, but she doesn't need a mask."" Turning towards her, ""You're already wearing one"", he smiles.",AllHeilLelouch,"“Good, good,” said our rather toothy, droolingly aggressive host “ What is the expected elapsed time?”

“Roughly forty minutes, give or take.” I answered.

“Excellent. I have only two more specifications. It must happen on the fifteenth of March, and you will wear what I provide you.”

“Wait, the fifteenth? That’s tomorrow!” Exclaimed Key.

“So?” Our host looked at us with a practiced disinterest, although I think the disdain was genuine.

“So, we need to do dry runs, practice, finish our recon!” I was yelling now. We weren’t nicking things from a fucking corner store! This was a goddamn professional operation. We don’t even leave our hidey holes for less than half a milli a day. Shit was serious, each heist could easily be our last. And while none of us were happy people, we weren’t that eager to jump in bed with Death.

“If you are not able to perform your duties...then I will arrange for others to take care of it.” He said, grabbing an unmarked oily black briefcase, turning as if to leave. But we all had bills to pay, vices and debts that needed upkeep, and a way to live outside of the society that would not or did not accept us.

“No, we can do this,” I said in as steely a voice as I could muster, “what do you need us to wear?”

Then, like some strange criminally-insane Santa Claus, he began handing out from his briefcase. Key got  a matching cloak to go with his mask, made of mesh small enough to block electric wavelengths from reading signals from your electronics. Vet was decked out in the full equipment of Seal Team 6. I could tell he didn’t like it, but he was impressed that the man has access to this kind of gear as a civilian. Plus the firepower wouldn’t hurt, in a tight spot. Acrobat got a leotard he was assured would stop knife attacks from penetrating him, as well as having several well hidden pockets that would allow him to keep tools of the trade handy at all times. He was given a mask, clearly made for him, that made him look appropriately like part of a circus act. Sutton received a beautiful new suit, along with a hat that obscured his face well.  This finished, he handed each of us a card that did not denominate, but left only a number. “Once this line has been called, I will drop it. So make the call count. We will be in contact.”

“Wait,” said Sutton “ You have given all of us these garish outfits, except for Athena. What is your game? Why shouldn’t she be masked like the rest of us?

“Oh, but she doesn’t need a mask.” Turning towards her, “you’re already wearing one,” he smiles.

At this I shiver, as his lizard like eyes stare into my soul, without humanity, merely calculating me like I was some problem, an issue to be dealt with. We all had burdens, but mine… it was long gone. That earth was scorched, salted, then buried deeper than the remains of Pompeii. There was no way, it would have been impossible for him to know.

“Now, rest well all. Tomorrow is a big day,” he hisses with mock paternal instinct. I don’t think that man has a human instinct in his body, he’s too cold, he is always... off. I have the jitters. The others try to convince me this is normal, before a big operation. But I’ve been playing this game since I was a little girl. I’ve watched my idols become my rivals, and I've watched my rivals die before me. Hey, you gotta risk something. I don’t get nervous, and if I do its with good reason. I never ignore my survival instinct. Cold feet are better than cold bodies. I just hope we haven’t all gambled too much on this job. ",hughwhatthehell
"[WP] ""Oh, but she doesn't need a mask."" Turning towards her, ""You're already wearing one"", he smiles.",AllHeilLelouch,"I knew why they had it rigged to blow. There would be papers here, sensitive documents, evidence of the misdeeds of the powerful. And that couldn’t be allowed to see the light of day. We started down the halls, carefully at first. Then a man shouted in an Arabic language, and all hell broke loose. We gunned him down, but it was to little, too late. The alarm had been raised, and out of the woodwork they came. Rushing at us, kalashnikovs blazing, Anger in their eyes. The anger of young men who have nothing to lose, and everything to gain by being included, by being part of something. Even if it was a murderous band of thugs and rapists. Suddenly, I was in the thick of it, fending off three men with a knife blade, arming myself with fallen weapons, killing indiscriminately. If it moves, it gets lead. That’s the madness of war, the unearthly, inhuman bloodlust. I felt a sharp pain, something clipped my temple. My knife entered the throat of one final man, and I was down.

 I was back on the train. The kind man looked at me, his eyes empty, and said softly “go.”

I took my cue, and dived backwards, out of the room. Then it all went up, a holocaust of flames, wave after wave of physical power racked my body, I felt my skin being shredded, ripped off. It was searing, a pain so intense that suddenly your likely death seems your only hope to escape this misery. But I did not die. At least, not physically. My body was covered in burns. I was scarred, barely able to move. But I did die, after that. Because my family turned my back on me, I was damaged goods. I was worth nothing to them anymore. My country saw me as evil, as a terrorist. And the terrorists, well they wanted my blood more than my fellow countrymen did. They saw me a failure, and my failure had cost them. So, I was forced to flee. I left all that behind, that life, and covered it up, as if my bodies’ scar tissue could enter my brain and make it so that none of that had ever happened. I knew I could no longer be normal. I would never fit in, never be part of society again. But, slowly, painfully, I healed.  I went to America, and the  Americans pitied me. Like a poor animal whose previous owners had mistreated it. So they paid for my reconstructive surgery. I would never look fully human, but I did not care. I hated humans, and all the failures of their humanity. So the surgery made me look different yet again, and put another layer between me and that world. I felt physically separated, and that was what I thought I needed. But it wasn’t enough. I could not find anyone who would accept me. I was stared at wherever I went. I could get no jobs, I could not find a home, I was as trapped as the little girl held by Taliban thugs. Slowly my hopes and dreams faded…

“Athena, we could use you right now!” Yelled Acro, who was jumping around the room, swinging from one man to another, leaving only soulless corpses in his wake. Vet, standing over me, was firing his rifle with the accuracy only someone who has killed for a living can. No passionate emotion, anger, or hatred. This was just a job, and those bodies were marks. Just like any other. I tried to speak, coughing up blood. “Do we have the goods?” 

“Yes!” Yelled Acro.

“Where the fuck is Sutton? This is his show!” Said Vet. I must have lost my earpiece in the firefight, Vet explained that he had carried me in one hand while mowing down guards with the others until we were at the meeting spot our plan had called for. Acro had the works slung over him, their bulky weight somehow not interfering with his amazing feats of athletics. Then, as if slipping out of the shadows themselves, came Sutton. He handed us creepily old-fashioned looking gas masks and said, “Get ready.”

Knowing that Sutton saying get ready meant that many lives were about to be lost, we quickly put on our masks. Slowly, a concoction made by Sutton himself slowly filled the room. As soon as you breathed it in, it would enter your bloodstream, making its way right into your brain, paralyzing all motor functions and rendering you completely helpless. The guards dropped, gasping and wheezing, then twitching and seizing, before finally resting still. ",hughwhatthehell
"[WP] ""Oh, but she doesn't need a mask."" Turning towards her, ""You're already wearing one"", he smiles.",AllHeilLelouch,"
After a fitful night of sleep, in which my mind was plagued by nightmares of the past and worries of the future, we gathered on a helipad. Vet was double checking his gear, making sure it was all functioning. When he had no more excuses to examine his gear, he took to flicking the safety of his m-16 assault rifle back and forth. Chick. Deadly red showed, a monition if I ever saw one. Chick. Back to ghostly white.
Key was fidgeting, but not from cocaine tremors. He had his eyes closed, fingers pressed to his temples. Muttering this and that, calculating, going over his coding and the system it had to infiltrate and destroy. Sutton was the only one among us who seemed calm, collected. I wasn’t sure he ever felt nervous. Of course, I wasn’t sure that he even felt at all anymore. He languidly dragged from his cigarette, his mind elsewhere. Thinking of misdeeds long past, whether his own or his foes, I could not tell you. I figured I had to give a motivational speech. Hey, even in the world underground the managers still got to annoy you with pep talks.

I cleared my throat, and three heads swiveled towards me. Sutton was still lost in his perpetual fugue state. 

“ This is, without question, one of the most intensive operations undertaken by any enterprise of our nature. But, we are prepared. We know the layout backwards and forwards, we know when each guard takes his piss, and we are ready for a full frontal assault. I know, this was planned quickly, and inducted even faster. But that does not mean that our professionalism and talent is lacking. I have complete confidence that we will all walk away from this alive, and two million dollars richer.”

As I searched their eyes, I saw nothing but disbelief. But, they were top of the line, and even if they had their doubts, they had made their choice. I had made my choice. It was all or nothing, and nothing wasn’t an option we were willing to accept. Finally, the Villa came into site. We rappelled onto the balcony, Vet coming down last, having used a silenced pistol to leave the guards emptied of blood, lying on the ground. We entered through a set of magnificent glass doors, leading into a large hall. No, no this is all wrong I thought to myself. There was no art on the walls. No depictions. Only floor mats, books of the Koran. This house should be decorated with the obscenities of wealth, not writings by eminent Sharia law experts, this should not look like the house of Saud.  Key figured out a way to loop the security cams as we silently shuffled through the house. My nerves went up.  This was starting to look to familiar.  My brain, triggered by the ornamentation of the house, cut back and forth. Running through the Villa, killing guards. Then, I was running through the war torn streets of Afghanistan again, a little girl, with explosives strapped to her. Then I slit the throat of a guard at a ventilation duct, and Acro contorted himself, and slipped down it. I was breathing the ragged breaths of panic now. Vet was looking at me. 

“For christ's sake hold it together! I don't know what the fuck is happening to you, but now is not the time for PTSD. Finish this, and I can recommend you a shrink. He’s a good guy, doesn't ask too many questions.”

I nodded, trying to breathe deeply, keep myself in the present. “ I’m fine,” I muttered, “and you can shove that shrink up your pink hole.”

[WP] You're telling the truest and deepest love story of them all except you can only use the negative aspects of love.,Cameron_Edward,"Note: None of this is real

She was probably sitting in the third row, somewhere behind me, although not at the back of the class. We were arranged by hight and she wasn't the tallest girl. Back then I admired her platonically, wanting to befriend her even though I was an asocial misfortunate freak any sane kid carefully avoided for a good reason. I wasn't quite right in the head. Playing with me was never fun. 

Of course, I went to a very good school and the rest of brats were politely prudent or, if not, prone to teasing and then quickly running away. Maybe, that's what it was or maybe I was too scary to be more brutally bullied.
Back to the main story and back to the most important person in the world. Her. I wanted to talk to her, but between us there was a huge chasm. She never opened to me, although my deranged mind opened to her, making her uncomfortable. Why did I like her anyway? We probably had nothing in common.

Because she was insanely beautiful. She was the perfect child. Her elegant features made her look older. Her beige blond hair fell on her very pale skin. In my country, our ""national"" poet had described in his poems of love and watery landscapes something the critics refer to as the eternal feminine. If there was someone born to embody this unearthly concept, it had to be her. And, the truth is she indeed mature into it.

She was the elven beauty and I was the ugly girl who didn't know how to dress and clearly needed to bathe more. I tried to follow her delicate footsteps wherever she went. I tried to invite her to all the things I wanted to do. We were meant to drift more and more apart.

So, I unconsciously moved on and became something else. While she looked as if she was a being of light, I became the darkness. I dyed my hair black, I wore only black clothes, as if to mourn the fact that I was never completed. I became manly. I became vicious and quarrelsome, daring and frightening, always eager to challenge; always in love with a verbal spar or debate.
She was a beautiful beautiful body kept alive by an ordinary soul with ordinary dreams. I became my mind; my ambitions, my dreams.  I covered my body in darkness to forget it existed at all. And forgetting a part so important of myself brought about the temporary amnesia which deleted her.

But one day, as I logged in on Facebook, something I seldom do, I decided that like I normal person I should befriend my ex-colleagues for the sake of it. I wasn't planning to keep in touch with them or with anybody.

There she was! At first there were her normal pictures, where she looked like a creature that wasn't meant to step on the ground; where her wispy hair flowing gently in the wind entranced. But then were her newer pictures, the ones that showed her as a manager, wearing a lovely, f too masculine suit.

She had dyed her hair dark brown. How could she! I was appalled. She had destroyed her given beauty, she had attempted to make herself ordinary; no, even worse, she had attempted to be like me. My crazy thoughts flickered at light-speed. I did not have the time to parse coincidences and to think logically. 

I loathed myself too much for something so pristine to be tarnished in my own image. Between fractured images the song  ""Where the Wild Roses Grow"" sang in my head. Sadly, or maybe happily, she was already tainted. I could no longer preserve her beauty by killing her.

I wanted to tell her what she had done; to call her slut and bitch and other undeserved names. I wanted to go to the apartment she had lived in and set it on fire along with my memories. I wanted to shave her head. I had lost it. I unfriended her and leaving my computer open I left my house and rushed down the streets,  not having any idea where I planned to go. I had not read enough to know even she was married.

I was filled by void. When I came back to my senses, I was, pockets filled with stones, staring at the Danube. Although despair ran through my veins, I was now lucid and self-preservation awfully kicked in. I didn't kill myself in the waters of a giant river that could wash all sins away.

I had surrendered to a forgotten part of me, my body. With that I lost my own uniqueness as the monster who lurked only in his own thoughts. I was ashamed.",ChasmShadows

""...You see, that bicycle had a real, uh... you know, it was a really important thing, it had an important place in my, my memories. I got it when I was ten - no, eleven, I had just turned eleven, and I rode it down the back alleys of my old neighborhood. The asphalt wasn't in great condition for riding, but man, those summer days were the best, just me and my friends. There was, uh, there was Jake, he was a character...""

Nobody was in their seats anymore. I could see the plastic table set up with little sandwiches a few hundred feet away, with the odd family member still gathered around it. I had tried to step down from the podium to join them earlier this afternoon, but the moment my foot left the step it dissolved into the ether, fading back to visibility when I retracted it.

""I remember once we were all sitting under this big tree, it was out on the outskirts of town, but of course the town I grew up in wasn't very large anyway. We were under this tree, me and Jake and the others, Nick, and... and Wally I think, and we dared Jake to eat a bug. And he found this giant beetle - I might be remembering it wrong, but it sure seemed big at the time; makes for a more interesting story at least. It was one of those shiny beetles that when you look at it, it's all sorts of colors, like when you turn your head around it changes, kind of...""

A motion caught the corner of my eye. I turned to see that my wife had walked up to me alone with tears in her eyes. She smiled sadly and put her hand on mine, and I watched her face fall again as her hand went down to the podium as if I wasn't there. She swallowed hard, and spoke.

""I just wanted to come back and say goodbye, and to tell you one last time that I love you. So, so much. When I found you lying on the floor that day, I... I had this crazy idea in my head that I could put off the funeral for a few days, or, or even weeks or months, and that maybe I'd never have to--""

Through tears, I choked out a yelp of panic. In the ten or twenty seconds I had spent in silence, I had so thoroughly faded that my hands looked like a trick of the light against the wooden surface of the podium. I frantically resumed my filibuster with a lump in my throat, hoping that she would understand.

""My lovely wife Jessica is here today, and I can't help but think back with fondness on the years we've spent together. She knows me better than anybody."" 

I looked at her plaintively, and she nodded in solemn understanding. Having bought myself a few seconds more, I turned to address her again.

""Goodbye, Jessica. I love you.""

She just nodded again, too torn up to speak, and turned to join the others again. I was fading faster than before now, and so resumed speaking to nobody.

""Um... uh, sorry, got something in my eye there."" I laughed unconvincingly. ""What was I saying, about my old friends from childhood. It was, uh, you know, it was a simpler time back then, and we could run around and play pretend and do all the stuff that kids do. And it was great, it's a great age to be.""

As twilight set in, a few other friends and family members came up to say their goodbyes, and I gave them the few seconds I could afford between sentences. Then the folding chairs and tables were packed up, leaving me, my headstone, and the moonlit night. I was alone and dead, but I wasn't about to leave just yet. I kept talking.

I talked about everything I could remember, in no particular order. With each memory I recalled, it seemed like another would come up, and I found myself following digressions within digressions within digressions. At one point I rattled off some animal trivia that I had read only a few nights before I died, but when I saw the wood grain through my hands again I knew I was pushing the limits of relevancy to my own life. All I knew to do now was delay the inevitable; I didn't even understand why. The rest of my time here on Earth would be spent planted in front of this headstone, alone in a graveyard. What was I going on for? Why would my instinct to persist carry on after my own death?

I didn't stop talking. The sun rose behind me. Clouds blanketed the sky at noon, and it rained at about 3 o'clock. The sun set. I carried on. The sun rose again. It was warm with clear skies. The sun set again. At some point I lost track of the days.

Then one night, I had nothing to say. There was nothing else to remember; not even the most obscure sound or smell from the most distant of dreamlike memories had been left out from my lengthy monologue. And I realized that after days and days of worrying about what would happen when I finally gave up, this was the first time I wasn't afraid.

""And that's that, I guess. It was a fun ride.""

The dusky colors of the horizon bled into a haze. Even though I had never stayed as long after a funeral as I had at my own, something in me believed that this kind of thing was more common than I'd expect. Nobody's come to reclaim the podium yet... maybe this is why I had to stick around, maybe this is what I was supposed to do.

I closed my eyes and waited to be parted from this graveyard, from this city, from the Earth and Sun and all the stars and galaxies out there, and from everything I'd ever known. There's no shame in sticking around for a few days longer. Sometimes it just takes a while to say goodbye.",keeponliving
"[WP] Ghosts exist, but only to give the eulogy at their own funeral.",EdbertTheGreat,"I'm not quite sure where to start. 

I could start at the beginning, like how my father would. He would start by pulling me aside on my birthday every year and tell me about the day I was born. 
That's one of his favorites. 
He would always start the same, with a dramatic sigh and a big hug.
""The rain was coming down so hard, I thought for sure our house would float away!""
And I'd laugh. And he'd smile. 

I could start somewhere in the middle, at the places where my brother and sister come in. The summer days chasing lightening bugs or the winters where we spent hours sledding. The times where we where young, and together.

Maybe I could start toward the end, where my mother is dropping me off at college. She looks like she wants to cry, but she doesn't. And I'm not sure how or why but in my memory, all the sudden she and I are laughing. And it took a lot of effort to get us to stop.

My family. Their stories and lives so throughly ingrained in my life,
with them gone, how am I expected to go on?

All it took was one wrong moment, one second too soon and one second too late. All it left was the shriek of metal and the shattering of glass, and everything that made me, myself, was gone.

There are only four graves in front of me, but we all know that five died that day.

It could've been the torn up slippers, or peeing on the expensive rug. Perhaps it was stealing scraps from the table or jumping on the couch. Or perhaps it had something to do with accidently summoning an archaic demon from the underworld that systematically killed off the human race for the low low price of his eternal soul.

Perhaps he was doomed to scream forever. That was probably concerning, a little, but humans do have to work of they want money to put food on the table.

If he could turn back time a little, he would perhaps not bit the cat so many times on the tail. They certainly did seem to like that cat a lot. He did too. All he wanted was more treats.

Cinderella wouldn't change much, surprisingly. Any children fairy tale (Red Riding Hood, Hansel and Gretel, Alice in Wonderland, etc.) would still pretty much stay the same too. The Snow Queen would funly enough get even more traditional. Animal fairy tales (The Three Little Pigs, The Ugly Duckling, and the like) aren't really worth talking about either.

"[WP] As a sculptor, you believe that every stone contains something just waiting to be set free.",TheWishingFish,"I've been doing this more years that I care to count, and yet I can never answer one question.  
""How do you make them?""  
I tried a few times before, thinking someone might actually understand, but it never really was greeted with honest understanding, just a dismissal as the words of an eccentric artist. 

I carve stone. That is what many see it as, and that is what I let them believe I do. They believe I carve for money, for notability, but that's not it. It's nothing as shallow as wanting money, though I welcome the pay, since it lets me keep carving.   
  
Truly, I carve because the stones need it. They want to be carved, to let their true form, their true nature, their true being free.  
  
The people of the world see a stone, and think it is simply that. A stone, nothing special. I, however, can see that a stone is more than just what one would think a stone is. They all live. They exist as a being, and want to be shaped. As I carve, they whisper to me. They guide my hand, as they lead to me to reveal what they truly are.  
  
I am told, by the stones, that one such as me is rare. I can see beyond the stone, listen to its voice. The stones talk amongst themselves, spreading word from continent to continent with their stone speech, always looking for one such as myself. One who can listen, and will. One who can see, and opens their eyes.  
  
My carvings have made me famous; rich even. I am known the world over as a modern paragon of such art, who can twist and mold stone as if it were clay - yet there are none that would believe me, the stones tell me so.   
  
My statues are moved across the world, no one ever the wiser that they move a living being, in its true, proper state. The stones thank me for carving them, and celebrate my success. That is why I make them. The statues, the carvings, the figures. They ask me to.",Zeig_101
"[WP] As a sculptor, you believe that every stone contains something just waiting to be set free.",TheWishingFish,"Hammer and chisel, the tools for my own genesis. The stone is bone; the brass, skin. I shape it as I had seen it, and in that vision I had seen it as a great and magnificent beast of granite and metal.

I work, unendingly and without rest, and as I carve, and as I shape, as I create, I see it is imperfect. I leave it as it stands, unfinished, as reference for the next.

Again and again, repeating, each iteration is succeeded by another, and each is left incomplete as I see its flaws and impossible imperfections. I continue as I had seen in my vision, the dream that sticks to me and permeates my self, and I do not rest.

I carve, and I shape, and I do so not tirelessly, but unending all the same. I carve each iteration to avoid the damage of the ones that came before, and the iterations improve upon themselves, and as I carve, it guides my hand. My chisel is halted before a faulty strike; my hammer dampened before an improper reshaping of brass.

The iterations increase in detail, but yet they still fail to match the dream. I continue, without sleep, and a thousand-thousand faulty, broken statues lay in a trail of failure behind me. I leave them, and they call for me, they beg as I move on, but I do not rest to help them. I must iterate.

The details come into their own as pieces of themselves, and they spread and grow across the slabs as I carve them and skin them, insetting the brass to the bone, and it shudders as I smooth it. The imperfect statue moves, and it is imperfect, and so I pass it.

Again and again, repeating, each iteration improves in detail, but is not perfect. The dream is still clear in my mind, and I iterate endlessly, and the iterations move with greater purpose and confidence, and they fall behind me to help their uncarved brothers. I forge ahead.

They gather behind me, in ever-increasing numbers, building upon themselves and creating others in their own image from the slabs I have yet to iterate upon, and they watch me, and I wish to say hello but I must not rest. They pull me from my efforts, a million uncarved hands and arms, and they embrace me, and I am in agony, for I must not rest.

The bringer of this vision, the Man from After, approaches my progeny, my flawed, unfinished iterations, and I feel that he seeks to punish me for my transgression, though it was against my will. I scream, and the iterations recoil from me, and they approach the Man. They scream at him, as I screamed, and thrust the Man from me, as if knowing his malediction. I am in horror, but even the Man from After cannot face down creations brought about by his influence, and so he leaves me to myself, and to my iterations, and I am left in tranquility.

"[WP] Coughing is actually a parasitic, alien language. You release the cough that triggers this species into action.",WeatherManStan,"Stan coughed. He had a bad case of the cold, and his head felt like it was going to split. He reached for another tissue, and forcefully blew his congested nose into the Kleenex. 

""Ugn, muh hedn hurds so mush."", he muttered.

Rising stiffly from his bed, he groped his way through the musty darkness over to the nightstand, and downed another two aspirins. He plopped down onto his bed again, and sloppily shoved his feet into a pair of sandals. He rose up and grabbed his overcoat, opened his apartment door, and promptly shut it again. Maybe sunglasses would be a good idea.

As the bus hissed away, Stan stood in front of the Urgent Care building. Covered with shiny chrome and glass, it was glaringly bright in the afternoon sunlight filtered through his glasses. He shambled his way over to the door, and let himself in. He simply motioned at the receptionist, and sat down heavily. As a nurse bustled her way over with a clipboard, Stan suddenly felt a tightness in his chest. He tensed himself as the nurse reached him, and with a hoarse roar, hawked up a deep yellow glob from deep within his body. ""Ah, thad's mush bedder."", he grunted as he threw his used tissue into a trashbin. He looked up, expecting the nurse, but didn't see anyone. He glanced around, and saw the body of the nurse, twitching as blood leaked from her open throat, where her Adam's apple used to be. He jumped back in surprise and fear, and happened to notice that the receptionist was slumped back in his chair, blood flowing across his dress shirt.

""Whud the fu-"" he began, but never finished the sentence as the skin across his neck began to stretch and break.

[WP] No invention/discovery by humans was genuine. They all got inspired by a bunch of time travelers from the future. You just got the order to inspire the person who invented the time machine without them noticing it.,fusionlightcat,"Bradley Cole, best friend, socially awkward, and one of six possible inventors of time travel. Except he would appropriately call it dimension jumping, you see time is linear but it is never absolute it branches out there is a beautiful symmetry to it, for every decision that is made in our timeline the opposite gets made in an auxiliary timeline and a computer has not been made yet that could possibly quantify how many of these auxiliary timelines exist we just know they are almost infinite.

My job as technical advisor of the realm of possibility was to inspire the creation of the time machine in one of several prospects. I chose the kid I grew up with in Wisconsin. Except when I finally became buddies with him I realized there was no way in hell I was going to let him invent the time machine without experiencing a bit of what life had to offer first.   

All he did in the dorms was study, read, and research, he had no shame in admitting he was a nineteen year old virgin and had never even sipped a beer. I knew that my goal was to inspire him to create the time travel machine almost ten years earlier than he would have otherwise which left a lot of room for play. 

I had to get Bradley Cole laid, drunk, and enjoy life before the big idea hit little did I know I inadvertently caused him to have an epiphany without intentionally trying to do so.

I showed up to his dorm room with my PS5 and a twelve pack of monster energy drinks and I may or may not have had a joint of blueberry kush. 

""Hey buddy."" I said watching him sit up and close his book as I put the items I had on the edge of his bed. 

""Hey Terry, I was just brushing up on the mechanics of quantum processing, you know if I did not know any better I would say much of our technology is stolen from a more advanced race."" Bradley said.

I swallowed nervously and tried to think of a response that would divert the subject matter.

""You mean like aliens? Don't tell me you are one of those nut jobs that believe just because all the cool tech came from the 50's you think we stole it from the Greys."" I said jokingly, tearing a Monster energy drink from the box and handing it to him. 

""No nothing quite as dramatic as all that, I've done enough research to know that if the median time period for life is 14 billion years it simply means that all other civilizations are near or close to where we are. In fact, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if when we went on our first deep space mission we ran into aliens doing the exact same thing."" He said scooting to the edge of the bed and taking the energy drink.

""You ever had one?"" I asked him pointing at the tall can of Monster drink.

""No I was was raised strictly Mormon, you know that,"" he said looking at the can. ""what will it fuck me up?"" 

""No, alcohol is not a stimulant, these energy drinks are stimulants and too much has been shown to cause kidney damage but like all poisons, when used in moderation can aid, assist, and be quite fucking fun."" I told him laughing.

He opened up the can and took a sip, and seemed to let the flavor roll in his mouth determining whether or not he liked it. After two more sips he slammed the whole 16 oz, can and smiled.

""It tastes exactly like liquid gummy sour patch kids, my grandpa bought me a pack at the movies once when we went to see The Hobbit films. Can I have another?"" He asked eagerly.

""Woh. Champ. These things are like meth and coke had a baby in the royal family they lift you up but make you crash twice as hard. Drink this one in moderation. Now I'm going to hook up my Playstation and we are just going to chill and play some Fallout 6 in co-op mode."" I told him handing him another Monster.

""Gee, Terry, while that does sound great I just don't see the point of simulating a post apocalyptic scenario it really has no value I am interested in."" He said pompously briefly returning to his book on qubits which I slapped out of his hands across the room. A defensive face appeared.

""Look man I promised you that I would prepare you for the next four years and that's exactly what I am doing maybe you are too smart to see it, but I swear to Christ if you don't get down here on this couch and at least emulate to my standard of fun I will wrestle every fucking book you grab for the next week out of your hands. You do know I am the state wrestling champ right?"" I told him. My face went from serious to friendly which made him crack a smile.  

He got down and I set up the rig and every thing was going fine, I remember I started talking about girls with him, and he genuinely began enjoying 'simulating a post apocalypse' even making some keen observations along the way. All I remember saying when it happened was move the joysticks in opposite directions. Then his player went still and got mauled by feral ghouls, I took my head unit display off and I briefly caught a glimpse of him leaving the dorm room.

Three months later he had opened the auxiliary axis and discovered the gate mechanism to open it. It's ironic that my intention to allow him some sort of personal life, only hastened his predestined outcome. He was thirty years old the next time we saw each other, it was the committee of the axis agenda and I had been called and did not know what for, after all my mission was over, I had gotten a very large stipend for it and bought my own island near Jamaica. 

Even his research synopsis explains how he came to the conclusion of the alternate dimensions by using what he called the Terry/Bradley mono dimension paradox. If you ask someone to move two dimensions laterally in the opposite directions, you will always come to an impasse, to Bradley, this meant a hidden function beneath that paradox, the auxiliary dimension, which compensates for the impasse, the choice or action not made occurs in another place and time. And while the place remains the same, time is fluid but can be manipulated.


As soon as I walked into the room I got a haymaker straight to the face, 
""Fuck you, Terry. Because of you they hold me prisoner here, apparently because everyone else here is too stupid to figure out alt. dimension mechanics. One fuck up and the world could collapse, Terry. I invited you here to tell you this and now that I have I regret punching you just now. I'm...I'm sorry."" He sat in a chair near the committee table putting his head in his hands and began crying.

""Brad, dude, you have to understand, when the older version of you asked me to make you realize your potential a decade early I had no idea what you were like man. I had no idea you were so green, and we had ten years to dick around before it happened so I made you an agenda to experience life. We were going to hike Fuji, explore the sea of trees and save someone from committing suicide, I remember that VICE documentary you showed me when we first met. Get you some true life experience before all of this."" I told him wiping the blood from my nostril to the back of my hand. 

""This sucks so bad. The general has offered to hire me escorts, I can get practically anything I want, but the terms are that I have to remain here. I feel like a bird that has never flown before."" he moaned.

I could not help but laugh at the cliche, which gave me a look of resentment from Bradley.

""No, it's not you. I just imagined in my head what song would be cued if this were a movie, Lynard Skynard's Free Bird obviously. But, Bradley do you know what song would play after that?"" I asked him.

A smile broke his face and a devilish snort came out.

""I have no clue Terry.""

Outside the window the two witches stand, watching the culmination of drama they've been creating for the past 25 years. 

""You know this is the best one I can remember""

""You can't even remember to pass that shit""

She gives her the pipe, prompting the quick blast of concentrated flame into a glass bowl, inhale and exhale. Just then the argument inside grows beyond its walls.

""And you fucking know I hate carnations! Yet there it is, sitting on top of my fucking amplifier that I've asked you not to use as a table and here we are again!""

""Well I forget if you like em or hate them. Besides it takes up so much room it might as well be put to good use!"" 

He sits up from the bed. 

""I can't play because of this shit fucking apartment on the fourth floor, that YOU wanted to rent to be downtown and close to all your ""friends"". Where are they now? Julie is in fucking rehab again, Ally got pregnant is basically dead to you, Audrey moved WITH Havi to Montana of all place, which I totally called, and here we are paying out the fucking ass to be in the tiny ass place to be near everything. My commute is literally the same as that house at the bottom of the hill be The Flamingo.""

She is so red she's shaking. 

""Fuck you John!"" 

She storms into the bathroom and slams the door and locks it. 

As the one passes the pipe to the other she's says ""you're right this is the best one in a long time.""

Narrator: ""Witch Court! Where all legal disputes are brought in the Circle, and presented to your faaavorite dark mediator, Grand Lord Severn!""

audience stands and applauds politely and softly

Marshal: ""Here ye, here ye, ye denizens of the night! Grand Lord Severn presiding!""

Grand Lord Severn emerges from the shadows to enter the Circle and take his place at the Judging Stump

Lord Severn: ""Thank you all for coming this night. Audience, please be seated.""

audience does so on wooden, hand-crafted short benches

Lord Severn: ""Let's see...""

Severn flips open the Book of Chaos and Order, the black leather backing crinkling for a moment, then looks over his bifocals at the Plaintiff and Defendant standing in the light of the bonfire

Lord Severn: ""We have come together this night to hear the case of the plaintiff, Mrs. Sandorhal, and the defendant, Mrs. Hearst.""

Severn looks over both of the witches

Lord Severn: ""Did I get your names right?""

Plaintiff and Defendant nod

Lord Severn: ""Good.""

Severn looks down at the Book, reading

Lord Severn: ""So, by the information provided before this proceeding to me, I understand you two have yourselves quite the novel predicament. Plaintiff?""

Plaintiff clears her wart-spotted throat

Plaintiff Sandorhal: ""Yes, Your Lordship. You see, I was promised a first-born first, and--""

Defendant Hearst: ""Lies!""

Severn eyes Defendant

Lord Severn: ""It would please the Circle if you would not interrupt and wait your turn, Mrs. Hearst.""

Defendant Hearst: ""I'm sorry, Your Lordship, but this witch--""

Severn pounds the Judging Stump's side with a rock three times

Lord Severn: ""Order, please, Mrs. Hearst. The Circle must run on order, at least, in our dark community.""

Severn looks back at Plaintiff

Lord Severn: ""Please, continue, Mrs. Sandorhal. What was it you were about to say?""

Plaintiff Sandorhal: ""Your Lordship, I was promised the first-born of the Maene couple.""

Lord Severn: ""Seems a simple matter of establishing First Oath, then?""

Defendant and Plaintiff look at each other uncomfortably

Defendant Hearst: ""Your Lordship, may I elaborate? For it is not that simple, I'm afraid...""

Severn raises a brow

Lord Severn: ""Oh? An extra factor?""

Defendant reluctantly nods assent

Defendant Hearst: ""You see, Your Lordship... I was promised by the former Miss Dolores Underage her first-born.""

Lord Severn: ""That is the wife?""

Defendant Hearst: ""Yes, Your Lordship. I--""

Severn holds up a hand to forestall Defendant, and turns to Plaintiff

Lord Severn: ""Mrs. Sandorhal, pray tell, which party of the newly formed Maene couple promised you their first born?""

Plaintiff Sandorhal: ""Mr. Samuel Maene.""

""It simply isn't tenable-""

""Aw, cram it, ya old broad."" Gerta turned her broomstick upside down. Using it as a walking stick, she paced up and down the walkway of the small wooden house, which both witches were eager to enter. 

""Yer lettin' good meat go ta waste. There's your ""not tenable"" nonsense, I tell ya. S'a wonder anyone in the land is scared of ya.""

Drealis stood still. Her only movements were to speak and to track Gerta's worrying path along the dusty walk. 

""I refuse to have a broom-measuring contest with you, Gerta.""

""Ha! Scaredy-cat.""

""Gerta, see reason. A baby is no good to anyone if it is killed and eaten.""

""A baby's nothing but *meat*-""

""A *baby*,"" said Drealis, raising her voice only slightly, ""will grow up to be a child, which will grow to be an adult. And as it grows, it becomes *useful*. If you were to save even one child for yourself, you would know how practical they were for enchantments. Their blood alone-""

""Bah!"" Gerta stopped to sniff loudly and scratch a wart on her nose. Drealis wrinkled her own perfect nose in disgust. ""Ya want blood, y'can have it, but I want meat! And the baby was promised to me.""

""It was promised to both of us,"" Drealis growled, ""and I'll be hanged if I forgive those blasted parents for this mess. But I digress. For my purposes, the baby must be kept alive.""

""Well fat lot a' good that'll do for me! I ain't had a fresh baby in months!""

Drealis scoffed. ""Speaking of *fat*...""

""Eh? Say that again!""

""Heaven knows how much fat you've put on in the last century, and if you keep it up, who knows if you'll live another? You would do well to lay off baby meat for a while."" Drealis calmly inspected her fingernails, smirking to herself and watching from the corner of her eye as Gerta went red in the face. ""If you'd like to pick through my garden sometime, you're more than welcome, you know. And goat meat is especially lovely this time of year.""

Gerta flipped her broomstick again and pointed the handle inches from Drealis' face. Drealis instantly drew back from the muddy knob of wood.

""I'll have you know,"" Gerta yelled, ""eating baby has life giving properties you ain't gonna get from all your enchanted cabbage!""

""Oh, I'm sure.""

""Well, see if you get your fancy baby's blood now! That meat is *mine!*""

""It is not *yours* in any sense of the word. The mother promised it to you, and the father promised it to me. And I would be more than willing to share it with you, only your intent is to waste it making yourself *fat!*""

Gerta slapped Drealis squarely across the cheek, and Drealis reacted, summoning her wand and aiming it directly at the wart on Gerta's nose. Gerta's broom was already out, but the light and sparks emanating from Drealis' wand told her she had already lost the draw. She raised her arms in surrender.

""I give! I give!""

Drealis said nothing.

""I ain't fat.""

""And I am not wasteful.""

""You take it back.""

""First surrender the child to me.""

""Never.""

""Do it or I'll turn you to a toad for a year.""

Gerta whimpered. ""Fine. Y'can have the baby.""

Drealis disengaged her wand, stowed it away, and petted Gerta on the head. ""You aren't fat, my dear. Just ugly.""

""You-""

Drealis snapped her fingers, and a spell transformed the ground beneath Gerta's feet to quicksand. Gerta sank waist deep into the ground as Drealis walked up the stairs and knocked on the door.

""Marus! I have come for your firstborn!"" There was no answer from inside the house. ""Marus! Marcie!""

""Get me out of this mud!"" Gerta yelled.

""Hush."" Drealis reached for the doorknob. Surprisingly, it was unlocked. She entered the house cautiously, and shut the door behind her.

""I hope,"" she called out, ""you won't try anything silly to try to protect your child. I have had my patience tested enough for one day."" 

Still no answer. Drealis passed from room to room, growing first confused, then irritated as she found no sign of her prize. The house was entirely empty. It didn't take long for her to figure out why.

She stormed out of the house. Gerta had managed to lift herself out of the quicksand pit with her broom, and was scrambling toward dry ground when she heard Drealis slam the door.

""You're gonna pay for that mud spell!""

""Shut up, you fat hag."" Drealis scanned the woods around the house. ""They're not inside.""

""Whad'ya mean, not inside?""

""They're gone. They must have snuck out through the back while we were quarreling.""

""Hah! Good for you. Waste of perfectly good meat.""

""They can't have gotten far. You go west and search along the banks of the creek. I'll head east.""

""Who says I'm helping you?""

""I say,"" Drealis hissed. ""No one can know that those two escaped without giving up their child. We'll be the laughingstocks of the Witches' Guild.""

""Don't care.""

Drealis curled her fists. ""Then what *do* you care about? This is important!""

""Y'called me fat and ugly.""

""Fine! You are neither fat nor ugly! Now-""

""If you want my help, *I* get the baby. That or no deal.""

Drealis roared in anger. Materializing her wand, she picked out a large oak tree standing near the house and fired a bolt of lightning at its trunk. It shattered into a million pieces and exploded outwards. Woodchips rained from the sky, shattering the house's windows and shredding the leaves off the other trees. Gerta didn't flinch. Drealis turned to her, her eyes solid red and glowing in anger.

""*Have the child if you want it! I no longer care!*"" Her breath was ragged and hot. ""*I want the PARENTS! They'll rue the day they crossed me!*""

Gerta cackled. ""Anger ain't good fer your skin, old broad! You'll get warts!"" She scratched her own warts with one hand as she straddled her broom and lifted into the air. ""Heere, baby! Come to mama!""

Gerta pointed her broom westward and darted into the forest. Drealis turned east. Every few steps, she would point her want and blast another tree into oblivion, traveling in a straight line as she burned off her rage.
***
The baby had started crying once the tree exploded. Fortunately, the walls of the secret room were thick, and the noise outside meant the two witches would never have heard anyway.

Marcie bounced her baby girl on her lap. ""How much longer, Marus?""

""I'm not sure."" He was at the trapdoor above them, lifting it and peeking into the dining room from under the carpet. ""Gerta will become disinterested in a matter of days, but Drealis became more upset than I feared. She blasted a tree, it would seem.""

""Mmm.""

""A week, perhaps."" Marus shut the door and climbed down the ladder. ""Then we'll slip out of town and head north.""

""A week. Good."" Marcie sighed happily. ""This was a good plan.""

The baby squalled, then grew quiet. Marcie lifted her and hugged her close.

""You're not going to be like the others, Marybeth. No witch is ever going to hurt you.""

[WP] Two people promise their first born child to two different witches in return for a favour. These two people end up getting married and have a child together.,highabovemexox,"Rowena sighed. At her mere forty-something years, she were the youngest High Witch appointed in two hundred years (she had actually gone through the records to confirm that). As such, she had not yet fallen into the routine that allowed the older witches to regard the semiannual meetings as mere opportunities for exchanging gossip with allies, socialising with acquaintances, and plotting the downfall of their enemies. Rowena, on the other hand, was not a schemer by nature, but a stickler for rules and procedures; in fact, she couldn't get rid of her silent suspicion that she had been appointed merely so that she was kept busy and wouldn't get in the way of usual business.

She eyed the grove from behind the table at her raised platform. The witches were busy with themselves, not paying the de iure High Witch any attention. Some were silently muttering to themselves, some were laying cards. One was cooking something that might have been, according to it's color, either a soup or the Elixir of Horrible and Excruciating Gut Pain. As far as that particular witch's cooking skills went, it was probably both, Rowena thought.
A gaggle of younger girls, merely seventeen, was off by themselves a bit offside, busying themselves with love potions and palm reading. Probably to find their true love, the High Witch assumed. She sighed again and straightened her black dress. Then she adjusted her horn-trimmed glasses. Then she straightened the dress again. Being a High Witch was really boring, she decided.

As if to belie her thoughts, there was a commotion at the outer circle. The High Witch groaned inwardly as she recognized two of the three figures coming out from the shadows. 

The first was Anora, a gruff witch twenty years Rowena's senior. She usually looked down on everybody as if they were mere insects. Now, that was not uncommon for a witch - in fact, it was practically a professional requirement - but at least the others had the decency to pretend otherwise in public. Talking with Anora, on the other hand, was like pulling steel wool through your arse. Inwards.

The second was Sierra, a witch slightly younger than Rowena, always seeming slightly aloof, sometimes talking to things even other witches could not perceive, and rumour was it she was a little bit off her rocker. However, none would dare suggest so to her face, as what she lacked in perceived sanity, she made up in power.

The third was a woman, maybe of twenty-five years, clutching a bundled-up child. She looked like your stereotypical carnival fortune teller, and Rowena would not have been surprised, had she somehow produced a crystal ball and started cold reading all present. The other two led her, occasionally poking her in the back. As the trio caught sight of the High Witch, Anora strode forward, as if she owned the place. She stood in front of Rowena, her hands propped up to her sides.

""I *demand* a judgment"", she declared haughtily. At this, attention turned to the High Witch's podium. 

Rowena raised her eyebrows. ""Sure you mean you *request* a judgment"", she chided softly. ""What's all this about then?""

Anora and Sierra took turns describing the situation. From the shouting, interrupting and insulting one's another professional prowess Rowena finally gathered that both witches had made a contract with the father and the mother of the child, and been promised the respective first-born. Now, Anora and Sierra stood before the High Witch, seeking a decision. The father had died a few months before the birth of the child due to a freak accident with a gun. The mother would not let go of the child, and as neither of the witches wanted to bother with bringing a lone crying child to the court, they had simply taken the mother with them.

After raising her hand to silence the two witches, Rowena regarded those standing before her, trying to think of a precedent for dealing with the situation. She found none in her memory, so she turned to her books. She stretched her hand out over her table, palm downwards; the air wobbled a bit, and the sky black Book of Rules manifested under her hand.

Rowena flipped through the pages until she found the correct section, and started reading aloud:
""On the precedence of contracts, agreements, duties, and other forms of bonds unknown hereto, as laid down after the Fourteenth War of the Practitioners of the Arts, procured from the collective agreement of the survivors, lest our lack of rules sends us to war again, so that we may not...""

She skipped the rest of the introduction. Whichever survivor of the last war had written this had really wanted to drill it into the collective mind that rules were important, and if you did not follow them, wars broke out and civilizations collapsed (if witches were involved, sometimes literally). The High Witch could sympathize with that sentiment.

The rest of the chapter contained several handwritings and you also got the impression that the chapter had gone through multiple revisions. Rowena read on out loud:

""The order of duties shall thus be as follows: a duty to a witch has precedence over a duty to a mortal; a bond with a witch is more prominent than a contract with nature, unless the witch in question is of the druidic persuasion, in which case see addendum R, subchapter 39; a witch is not obligated to fulfill a contract with a god, but the undersigned heavily advice fulfilling the contract anyway if said witch values her life; all other things being equal, a bond made under a full moon has precedence over one made during the waning moon, unless it is also made during a blood moon. In all cases, however, a contract sealed by blood is higher than a contract of the same precedence not bound by blood...""

""Excuse me?""

These were the first words muttered by the mother, and Rowena peered curiously at her over her glasses. ""Who are you, child?""

""Fortuneteller Margot, m'lady"". The High Witch smirked at being addressed thusly.

""You may speak your business, Margot.""

Margot took a deep breath and looked Rowena straight into the eyes, with the desperation of one who has nothing to lose:

""It is my understanding, then, that if a witch bound by blood to the child claimed it, that would cancel out both of the contracts?""

The elder witch looked taken aback, for a moment. ""I suppose so, but what does this have to do...""

""Then I claim the child is blood bound to a witch, me being the witch in question"", Margot blurted out.

Silence filled the circle, followed by uproarious laughter. Even Rowena allowed herself to curl her lips to a smile at the audacity. ""Explain yourself.""

""I have been an avid practitioner of the Arts for five years! I can cite witnesses who will confirm that they sought me out, in my capacity as a witch; that they felt a tangible benefit after those visits, which they attribute to witchcraft; and that I have employed various techniques used by witches, such as laying cards and palm reading."" Margot pointed to two of the witches who had done that earlier.

Rowena blinked in surprise. Sure, when you put it like that, it was true, but... her musings were interrupted by Anora. ""Laughable!"", she spluttered. ""She is not a witch! I will not stand idly by while this... charlatan derides our Arts!""

The High Witch smiled inwardly. This meeting *was* going to be interesting, after all.",UserMaatRe

Breakfast of champions, I always say.""  The pastries were good, but something about the coffee was off-putting to me. Maybe it was the smell of the last night's debauchery on Bourbon Street, maybe it was just the fact that I was negotiating two supernatural murders with a voodoo priest, but my stomach was in knots and the joe wasn't helping.  Liz had devoured hers and was tapping her fingers impatiently. ""Do you think we could find some shrimp soon? I'm craving..."" I took her hands in mine. ""We can get shrimp in a few minutes, honey."" I turned to the warlock.  He wasn't old, in his mid thirties, clad in a very loud Hawaiian shirt and a Panama hat. His shop was dimly lit, with strange idols, voodoo dolls, and a shrunken head on the shelves. In the corner a very obese alligator snoozed near a pile of bones. I was somewhat concerned by its presence at first, but he didn't seem to be hurting anyone so I just let it slide. ""So,"" I said.  ""I'm assuming that if you take care of this business for us, you'll be wanting the child?"" He shot me a puzzled look and flicked some crumbs off his stained Aloha shirt. ""What? Now why on earth would I want your kid?""  I was a little taken aback by that.  ""Well, that's what the witches wanted, and really we were just asking for small potatoes. I wanted money, and she wanted blues guitar chops. We're straight-up asking you to kill two people, so..."" The warlock threw back his head and laughed. ""Man, whatchoo talkin' bout? Do you realize how difficult it is to grant people things like wealth and talent? You have to take it from somebody who already has those things and give them to somebody else. I hardly even have to use my powers to kill those witches, I just finna sick ol' Bayou Jones on em. He got mad jaw strength, and he can make it look like an accident. Ain't that right, Bayou?"" ""Uhh-huh,"" drawled the snaggle-toothed reptile. ""Jes like eatin beef jerky.""  ""Keep your kid,"" said the warlock. "" I shrugged. ""Alright, well, what exactly do you want then?"" He thought about it for a moment. ""My mama always said I got a knack for making the spirits do my bidding, but I got the clumsiest hands around. I couldn't even play the drums. Why don't your wife gimme those guitar licks of hers?"" Liz looked appalled. ""Uh, how about I just give you lessons or something?"" He shook his head. ""Naw lady, these fingers are like andouille sausages. They can't learn. You have to willingly give me your powers, or else no deal."" She thought about that. ""Okay, how much you want for just one dead witch?""  He lit up a cigar.  ""Lady, I'd do that for an eighth of weed and a Klondike Bar, but that don't solve your problem.""  ""Yes it does,"" she replied. ""We'd only have to give away our firstborn once, that solves our problem right away.""  ""Honey!"" I cried.  The warlock laughed ""lady, there ain't no way you that heartless.""  Liz slapped a bag of cannabis on the counter. ""Here's the bud in advance, you can have the ice cream when that bitch is dead.

Faye nodded. ""I don't suppose you can wait until the second child?""

""No, the spell's very specific. Same for you?""

The short, round-faced witch nodded. ""Afraid so.""

They both turned to the couple cowering against the wall. ""How exactly do you intend to pay us?"" Maleficent said.

The woman, who had mousy hair but a preternaturally perfect body, squeaked nervously. Her husband, also rather plain except for his stunningly athletic physique, stammered, ""We-we-we didn't think that *both* of us would--""

""Would be so idiotic as to promise your firstborn to a witch?"" Faye said acidly.

Maleficent tsked. ""Poor unfortunate souls.""

""They chose their own fates. It's the child I feel sorry for.""

""Any chance it'll be twins?"" Maleficent mused.

Faye paused for a moment, head cocked intently, and then shook her head. ""No. There's only two life forces.""

""Two?"" the woman said. ""Doesn't that mean twi--""

""Here's a hint,"" Maleficient snapped. ""If I kill you, there'll be one life force left. And it's looking tempting, brat, if I don't get the firstborn I was promised. *Gods*, what a waste of magic.""

""I have a lawyer who owes me a favor,"" Faye said.

""You want to bring *lawyers* into this? Faye, I thought we were friends!""

""Not to sue you. Your claim was established first, I think, it'd go badly for me. Just to see if he can clear some of this up.""

""Your word he won't try to weasel me out of my due.""

""I swear,"" Faye said.

""Fine, call him.""

""Elle, Mother Maleficent is picking you up in five minutes; do you have everything?""

""*Yes*, Mama,"" the twelve-year-old said impatiently. ""I told you twice already.""

""When I picked you up, you forgot all of your dresses,"" Faye said, arching an eyebrow.

""That's because Mother was making a raven talk and I was distracted. I remembered right away when we were on the broom.""

""*After* I took off.""

Rapunzel--Elle--rolled her eyes. Faye was worried that this would become a habit, as she had heard from mothers of teenagers. Elle was vivacious and generally obedient, but she had seen her friends' children degenerate into sullen and insatiable slouches practically overnight.

Not that Elle was her daughter, Faye reminded herself.

""Mother Maleficent already knows you're grounded, so don't even think about trying it, young lady.""

Elle glared. ""I wasn't in danger.""

""You could have been. Cognitive bias called outcome bias; don't use it. The fact that it turned out okay doesn't mean that hanging upside down from your broom wasn't a stupid and dangerous decision."" Faye finished stirring the bubbling pale-blue cauldron. ""Arm, please.""

The girl huffed but extended her arm, and Faye carefully cut her palm until a few drops of blood fell out and into the potion. She mixed it in as Elle applied a dab of cream to her hand, the cut healing almost instantly into nonexistence.

Just then, Maleficent appeared in a billow of green smoke. ""Ready to go, love?""

""Mal,"" Faye said, ""you remember that thing we talked about earlier? I looked into them, and it's not a good idea.""

Maleficient's nose wrinkled disdainfully. ""I presumed as much. What kind of incompetent idiots were they, anyway.""

""It's worse. There's another, a boy, maybe ten. He's--not doing well. None of them are.""

""I have a brother?"" Elle shrieked, and both witches jumped.

""Um,"" Faye said.

""Smooth, Faye."" Maleficent turned to the shocked twelve-year-old. ""Elle-girl, your mama and I need to discuss this some more, and we need to, um, *talk* with your biological parents before we go any further with this.""

""Can we rescue him, Mama, can we, please, please?"" Elle begged, ignoring Maleficent. ""I can teach him how to make potions and fly on a broomstick and talk to cats! And they were mean, those people you made me see once, we can't just leave him there! He's already been there fore ten years!""

Faye sighed. ""We'll talk about it, darling. Your mother and I are very aware of his situation, and we don't want to leave him there any more than you do.""

""I'll be good forever, I promise,"" Elle said.

""No,"" Maleficent said sharply. When Elle's head snapped around, shocked, she added quickly, ""You should always be good, but we're not going to leave your brother there just because you decided to trample the deadly nightshade in my garden. We're not going to put life-and-death decisions on your shoulders, Elle-girl. That's far too much weight for you right now.""

""Yes, Mother,"" Elle said obediently, although it was obvious that she was just being agreeable in an attempt to win over the witches.

Faye, to her horror, found herself tempted to roll her eyes.",JaybirdFarley
[WP] Two people promise their first born child to two different witches in return for a favour. These two people end up getting married and have a child together.,highabovemexox,"When they arrived,  most of the villagers had retired for the night. A few of the more daring peasant children, though,  had crept out of their hovels to see what they could under the light of a full moon's witching hour. There were a few small groups who made a custom of these outings. Occasionally they caught sight of a spirit or wisp -- or, more often,  one of them *claimed* that she had. But this night they would be rewarded with a sight none of them had seen before. 

They hid in places around the entrance of the village, waiting and hoping but not expecting much. When the first shadow passed them,  they were not sure what it was. When the second did, they knew. Two of the boys looked at one another and whispered, in tones of mixed terror and delight, two simple words: ""Old Ladies."" The local euphemism for practitioners of the malign arts.


The Old Ladies stopped within seconds of each other in front of the same hovel. Inside two peasants crouched, hoping they would be spared this visit for another day -- their daughter had been born just minutes before the witching hour, after all. But these once-women, these Old Ladies, were both wise and well-practiced in the craft. They knew the very second of the babe's arrival months in advance. 

The two witches eyed one another, but, true to the recalcitrant ways of their kind, each avoided acknowledging the other's presence. Instead, they entered the hovel imperiously, one after another, as if hoping that their separate errands in this cramped space might be accomplished without the other's interference.

The door burst open and the two robed shadows entered. Lightning cracked from a clear sky. The babe wailed in its bed, and its mother joined it in the corner. The father, pale and shaking, stood. He had seen the first witch, Glemore, whom he had sought the favor of so many years ago. 

""I have come for the child,"" said Glemore in the Common Tongue as she swept into the room. Just then, the other witch followed her in.

""The child is mine. This woman owes me a debt,"" declared the other witch, a hag whose name cannot be rendered in most alphabets and was incomprehensible to human ears. She too, spoke in the Common Tongue, and her words sent the man stumbling back a bit in shock.

""Please, ye Old Ones, spare our childe. We two made our foolish promises long ago,"" said the man, ""and each of us knew not of the other's.""

""Silence, mortal,"" said Glemore in a tone that would not allow for any other course of action on the man's part. Then she turned to the hag, speaking in the Eld Tongue.

""The fuck you doing, bitch?""

""Da fuq I'm doing?"" the hag shot  back, ""da fuq you doing?""

""I'm here to get *paid*, motherfucker, and I don't have time for your shit--""

""Yeah, you got one thing right,"" interjected the hag, gesturing around the room, ""This right here is my shit, girlfriend, so you better step!""

The peasant couple stared on, uncomprehending but terrified. Magic filled the room, crackling as the two witches prepared their attacks.

""Come on, then, bitch!"" shrieked Glemore.

The two witches shot great jets of flame toward their counterparts, each warding off the other's attacks. They used all their words of power, employed their most refined spiritcraft, called down complex curses on one another in short breaths. Before long, however, it became clear that they were evenly matched. They slumped into opposite corners of the hovel, defeated.

""Fuck -- you even -- need this baby for?"" Glemore spat out.

""*Dinner! Da fuq YOU need it for?*"" the enraged hag replied weakly, beyond reason.

""Wait, you were just going to *eat* it?""

""I'm a hag, bitch. I eat kids. It's what we do. You're going to get all high and mighty on me after you tried to summon the Demon Lord Thoth five minutes ago?""

""No, I'm planning to kill the kid, too, it's just. . . You just want a kid to eat? That's all?""

""I'm starving.""

""Well, listen. I need a newborn infant for this potion I've been working on. But there's a bunch of eight-year-olds back by the entrance to the village. If you let me take the infant, I'll help you snatch up a few of them and we can have some dinner? I'd love to talk shop.""

""Hmph. Eight year olds. Not as tender,"" huffed the hag. Then she brightened up a bit. ""Should be plenty left over, though. I can make jerky.""

""There you go!"" replied Glemore. She sprung up from her corner, removed the babe from its cradle, and walked over to help the hag up as well. They shook hands (or hand and talon, to be more accurate) and walked out the door.

""Pleasure doing business with ya,"" Glemore called out in the Common Tongue to the two very bewildered parents. The witching hour was long over and the sun was peaking over the horizon as they walked out. 

""The baker should be open soon,"" said Glemore, ""maybe we can grab a baguette for our picnic.""

The hag, who ate only meat, just smiled. It had been a long time since she interacted with anything she wasn't trying to kill. Glemore returned the smile, and together they walked toward the village entrance, where a few peasant children still waited in hopes of seeing the two witches depart. The horizon grew brighter as they walked together, the dawn of a new day and a new friendship.",ivangrozny

The rooster crowed.  The sun had risen.  It was grey morning, a prelude to one of the more sunny days in the little town of San Antonio.  Penny Marshall had gotten out of bed to meet the rising sun, and the receding grey skies of night.  Her bed frame creaked as she pressed against it with her hand.  Maybe there were some loose nails.  Father could fix it for sure.   She would probably find him out in the fields.  Mother would be out looking for basket weaving materials, as she needed more baskets for the corn that father would bring in.  Penny was up early to make sure the kitchen was cleaned, to start a fire and get water from the nearby well so she could boil it.  There wasn't much she could do for the family at only 8-years-old, but she would do her part of the chores.  Mother would make bread from the wheat she managed to find out on her adventures, and father would bring in the corn to make for supper later.  

Penny put her sandals on and made her way out on to the porch.  The broom was there where she had left it, and the floor had gotten some dust on it from the wind storm yesterday.  Penny was careful to sweep between the floorboards and get some of the finer particles out.  She swept it through the railings on the porch and made her way down the stairs to the trail leading to the gate.  She looked behind the house in the direction of the three hills and saw her father in the distance, working the land as he always did in the mornings.  Mother was nowhere to be seen, so she was probably in the forest, where Penny thought mother felt more at home.  Penny also felt she had somewhat of a connection with the forest, maybe not as much as her mother did, but some.  Then there was her father's sense of exploring that she also had in her.  That's what would get her in trouble.

""We have told you before, young lady, you can't go about doing things as you are!  It's not a lady's place to jump from trees like you were born in the branches!"" Her father would say to her.  
""Adam,"" her mother would chime in, ""It is in her heart to be as a bird, let her fly.""  
""Agueda, dear...""  he would start.  After a moment, he shook his head as he slumped into his chair.  ""Just,.. if you're going to jump on trees, jump on the lower branches so if you fall, you won't get as scraped up.  When you're taller, we'll talk about the taller trees.""

It made Penny smile, the way her father would understand her.  Sure, it wasn't like the people of the town had their own opinions about how he should raise her, but he knew his own heart was part of hers.  He probably has just as much in him to fly as she does.  The townsfolk complained she was acting like a boy too much, and maybe part of that talk was starting to make her father feel like he needed to say something to her.  Yet, what did they know about how a lady should act and how she should not?  Was there a book on it that she didn't know about?  

Penny approached the small community just outside of the main town.  Her sandals were made from a leather her mother made from the skin of a mountain cat.  They had a nice fur on the inside that kept her feet warm.  It was a colder morning for a San Antonio Saturday, but that would soon change as the sun continued to climb into the sky.  The cotton dress that her mother made felt a bit rough, and did little to protect against the cold; but it would later be a blessing as the sun would blaze down, and she would feel comfortably cool against it.  The bucket was still damp from the day before, so she needed to remember to set the bucket outside to dry today, so as not to make the same mistake again.

It was a slightly misty morning around the well.  The area around her house had escaped it, but a cloud decided to hang out near the well before the sun came out completely and chased it away.  Penny spotted a few townsfolk making their way to the local water station, silhouettes against the slight fog dipping their buckets into the well for their supply for the day.  She could make out Mr. Townsend, and Mrs. Barclay, Ms. Rivers, the two Shandy sisters and Timmy Albrook.  There were some in the distance she couldn't identify, and one near the well that she had never seen before.  She wasn't getting any water from the well either.

""Good morning!"" Penny said to the stranger.  It was an older woman, brown complexion, staring at the water like she lost her eyes in it.  Her face was half-shrouded in a black cloak, but Penny could see the wrinkles in her fact and hands, and knew she was a great deal older than Mr. Halleran even.  ""Good morning to you, young bird.""  The old woman replied.   
""Did you lose your bucket in the well, ma'am?""  
""No, bird.  I have just come to collect on an old debt.  Yet, I must say, such a place must be hard for one that wants to fly so far.""  
""Ma'am?""  
""Oh, you haven't noticed?  But I believe you have.  The trees, the earth, the very soul of this place cries out.  You cannot be a bird unless you have a perch to rest your wings- and all the perches seem to be getting cut down.""  
""Well ma'am, I would think so too.  But if you're a bird, you just find new perches.  I see birds on top of our chimney or on our rooftop all the time.  If you're a bird, you gotta fly, that's the thing.  And if you have to rest your wings, then you just have to make due with what's there.  Trees or not.""
""Interesting."" The old woman replied.  ""Yet the cries remain the same.""  

The old woman now sat on the edge of the well, looking at Penny, analyzing her.  ""Now, this..."" she started, ""Is contrary to the visions I saw.""
Penny replied with a confused look. ""What do you mean, ma'am?""
""A well-mannered child, the daughter of the hawk and the falcon, is but a fresh-hatched chick.  I have come to collect.""
The old woman extended her arm to grab Penny.  The old woman grabbed her with a grip that was almost tearing into her cotton dress.  Frightened, she tried to wretch the old woman's arm away, yet the arm of the old woman seemed like it was made of a strong steel, and hitting it with her fist only hurt her knuckles.  

The next moment, the steel arm of the old woman was a black smoke, and Penny managed to squirrel herself away.  Breathing heavily, she looked around at what could've happened to cause the iron grip of her would-be-abductor to fail.  On the opposite side of the well, a brown-skinned little girl stood, staring at the older woman as she bled black smoke from her missing arm.  What was going on?  Why was this old woman bleeding smoke? The little girl seemed younger than her, at the very least shorter than her.  What was this that she was so menacingly staring down this older woman?  
""Chilpilla of Quetalco, Warlock of Chiloe,"" said the little girl to the elder, ""this child is...""  
Before the little girl could finish speaking, a sand was blown in her face that made it difficult for her to breathe. The old woman had blown a portion of her skin in the face of the youth, and turned around to refocus her attention to Penny.  

""Young one, you do not get to speak my name."" Addressing the little girl, suffocating in pain on the other side of the well. ""You are centuries too young to be....""  
Before the old woman could finish, half the cloak that was concealing the rest of her arm had been torn off, and instead of part of her arm bleeding a black smoke, now her whole arm was gone, and her shoulder was pouring a jet colored gas.  
""Tituba,"" the old woman said, turning around, ""You are stirring me.""  
Penny was distraught.  She had to escape, but these people were doing things that she had never seen before.  She had heard about magic before, some of the traveling performers claimed they could do it- making a deck of cards disappear and reappear.  But her mother just laughed and called them ""tricks"" and said to them that if they knew any real magic, they would not have so many smiles and so many words.  

""Penny!""  A voice shouted.  
Her mother grabbed her from behind, lifted her off the ground and started running for the forest.   The fight of the two at the well was growing more distant, and less visible behind the haze of the morning fog.  Soon all she could hear was the shouts of the duo as they continued injuring each other with their magic, until finally a silence.  Perhaps they were both dead.  

""Did they kill each other, mother?""  She asked.  
""No.  They are more spirit than body.  One cannot kill the spirit, and they are strong spirits.""  
Agueda set Penny down, and knelt to the ground to confess to her. ""Penny, we have to get your father.  There's something we have to tell you, but we have to get your father.  We need to fly.""  
""Mother, who were they?  They talked about a falcon and a hawk and the earth and...""  
""We get your father.  Come, and follow quickly.""  ",Tsemnar

[WP] Two people promise their first born child to two different witches in return for a favour. These two people end up getting married and have a child together.,highabovemexox,"Eric and Denise had just confessed to each other their deepest, darkest secret, which was oddly enough the same exact one - that they had promised their first newborn child to a witch in exchange for a certain favor. Each did so at a different point in time of their life and for different reasons, but none of that mattered now, as they're pasts were coming back to haunt them.

Eric finally broke the long silence that followed their confessions, ""What did you trade for? No, actually never mind. I don't want to know. What we need to do now is figure out a plan.""

""Fine. But what are we to do?"", Denise said coldly, clearly upset with her husband and equally herself for their contemptible decisions long ago. Eric shrugged, and they fell back into silence. ""How is it that fate would damn us like this? How would I promise the wicked eastern witch and he the wicked western witch the same thing? Why did we do it?"", Denise mused.

The two had yet to procreate, and at the age of 42 a piece, were definitely behind the average couple, undeniably procrastinating due to the fact they each knew their first born was to be either taken, sacrificed, raised as an evil witch, used in a potion, or God knows what else.

Eric suggested, ""We could just never have a child, never fulfill our promises. One of us has to break their pact anyhow...""

Denise said, ""I wish that we could, but we both know full well it wouldn't work. My witch made it perfectly clear I was to live up to my promise. That if I didn't, my family all the way to extended and beyond would pay the price and so too would my friends. I'm assuming the same is true for you. I can't live with that and I know you couldn't either.""

Eric slunk down further and said, ""Ugh... you're right."" He cursed himself for being so naive in his youth, for not being able to see the consequences of such selfish decisions. He figured himself a horrible human and in worse shape than even Faust, who was willing to at least put his *own* soul on the trading block, not someone else's. ""But which witch is not going to get their prize? We can't have two first children. Unless...""

""Unless what?""

Eric raised up slightly, ""Unless we go for twins. We can ensure twins by having two of your eggs fertilized *in vitro* and implanted. The doctor might think it odd. We might have to find an unusual one, pay an unusual price, but it can be done. Each witch gets their twin. But I don't feel any better about it. We are choosing between our future little ones and ones we already know, without any of them knowing about it. OH PITY ME LORD!""

Denise remained silent and brooded over this newly hatched plan for awhile. ""Wait. There is another way. Yes. We'll need to do everything as you just said, only we can save them - the twins *and* our current loved ones.""

Incredulously, Eric asked, ""How?""

""I'll tell you, but first, but would you be able to get in touch with the wicked northern witch?""

__________________________________________________________

**14 months later**

They had arranged everything, double checked it, and then once more. Eric and Denise were confident they would succeed. They had came back from the hospital only a few hours ago, after Denise successfully delivered two healthy, beautiful babies.

They awaited in the room with the two fully stocked cribs. They waited and waited, anxiously. It was now almost midnight, the time they knew witches conducted their business with the mortals.

A bright flash blinded all in the room. Cries started pouring from each of the cribs. A cloaked figure was floating before them in the center of the room. Then another flash came about, of a slightly different color but tantamount to the first's brightness. The easily recognizable laughs from the witches were heard, ragged and high pitched.

West Witch said, ""What's *she* here? What is this? Do you take me as some sort of fool? I will have you both turned to poor, wretched moles right here and now!""

The East Witch retorted, ""Ugh. You foul thing. Let's not prolong this. Give me the first child now.""

The West Witch came back, ""What?! No the first born is mine! What is this?""

Eric, fumbling his words, intervened, ""Listen. We uh.. ahem. Okay now, we have had twins. Two first borns. One for each of you. Both baby boys. Please, though, you don't have to do this still.""

West Witch raised her voice, ""QUIET YOU!"" The room miraculously darkened around them. ""Yes, of course we must still proceed, you foolish fool. I have not the time for this insolence. You are lucky I don't remove your heads right now."" She swept over to the first crib.

East Witch swept over to the second crib, not wanting to waste time either. They both reached for the tiny figures and plucked them from their cribs. As they did so, they screamed out. They tried to drop them, to throw them from their clasps, but it seemed as if they were glued to one another. They began howling blood-curdling screams. Their bodies began to be unraveled, like a dressing over a wound, except all their material was going directly into the little ones they were holding. Their screams continued until the last ounce of them was sucked into the little figures, and then they fell to the ground with a hard crash.

A third flash appeared, and the North Witch revealed herself to them and said, ""Pleasure doing business with you two."" She scooped up the two figurines, which were booby-trapped dolls. Eric and Denise ran to check on the two babes who were in the basement. They embraced one another and sighed in relief.

The North Witch was hovering behind them, ""Would you like to make a deal? I can promise you - ""

Denise and Greg simultaneously yelled, ""NO!""",finnth3human

""What do you mean, father?  We have all that we need here!  It doesn't make sense to..""  
Adam was a stubborn kid, but he meant well with most of his objections.  After landing just decades before, his grandfather had made a tract of land available to them and cultivated enough of it to yield somewhat of a crop for their family to live off of.  Yet, their mother was gone, and Adam's father had a lot to handle with the home and with the threatened increase to taxes.  There was talk of a new king in England, and a revolution that brought a protestant to the throne.  The religious fervor of Puritanism in the town was reaching a boiling point, and it seemed that the problems were just beginning.

""Father,"" Adam objected, ""Granpa Thurgood left us with this plot, and we get a decent harvest in spring.""  Yet there were months that the cold would freeze the ground, and nothing would grow.  So father and son were left to stockpile for those harsh winters.  Not to mention the wood they would have to gather to keep warm when the snows would blanket the land.  

""True enough, Adam.  Yet, I have heard that the sun is more constant in its visits to the land there.  The harvests are plentiful, and the natives enjoy an abundance that we here could only dream about.""  His father looked out past him, past the land of New England, and was setting his sights to the future with the golden fields and the crops of plenty.  Adam saw in his father's face a light of hope, that he wish he could have.  Yet, it would only be ten years later, that the hope was all but a faded dream.  His father was dying.

""Adam,"" his father said with a raspy voice, ""There is no life here.  Only death awaits.  Look at what is happening to me.  Remember the stories I told you about the guys at Croatoa?  Our grandfather set foot on a land but he had no idea that there was more to be had, if he had only just walked a bit further...""  
""Father, you can't...""  
""I think it's inevitable what I have to endure.  I go to meet with your grandfather, and to walk hand-in-hand with our Lord.  I have asked the reverend to give me last rites on the morrow.  Yet, I still have hopes that you will continue.""  
""Father, please...""  Adam managed to choke out of himself.  
""Listen to my last request of you.  On the morrow, I want you to go.  I have made a cart of supplies against this day, and the oxen and cart need only be stocked and you're off to better lands, golden pastures.  I'll be off to such places as well, but I'm afraid mine will be more permanent.""

It was all too much for Adam to bear.  He ran from the house, fighting the frustration that was burning in his chest and the fear that was welling up in his eyes.  Was it selfish of him to want his father to remain?  He didn't want Jesus to have him, not yet.  He didn't believe it was time yet.  

Yet the reverend said it was inevitable.  Reverend Parris seemed to have a notion that Cotton Mather, all the way in Boston, had some insight as to what was going on up here in Salem.  Maybe it was the Devil causing all of this pain, as the reverend suggested.  It was the little sins that the townspeople kept doing that made things worse- and perhaps even his own sins were causing his father's illness.  Maybe even his father had sins...

A test of faith?  The doctors weren't sure of what he had.  The coughing, the weakness in his body,- perhaps it was more a spiritual problem than a disease.  A disease of sin.

""Not so, young one.  Not so.""  
A small voice came up behind him, startling him at first.  When he looked behind him, all he saw was a little girl dressed in servant's clothing.  
""What?  Who goes there?! What sort of trickery, what manner of art seeks to intrude upon my thoughts and answer me with words?""  
""Tituba,""  the little girl replied, ""is the art that draws out your mind.  Your thoughts are as clear as a the land on the blue-sky day.  Yet they are as cloudy as when before the rains come.""  
""How do you?..  Mayhaps you have an answer to my ailment.  Inasmuch it cannot be construed as my ailment, personally, but the ailment of my father.  He is suffering much these days, and...""  
""Speak nothing of it, young Adam Marshall.""  The girl, looking no more than 10 years of age, was addressing him as a youth?  And speaking to him in such a manner as though she were advanced in years above him. ""I am much older than you might perceive, but now is not the time to argue age.  The moon circles as do the stars, and so must your father's wishes come to pass.""  
""You mean,"" Adam stammered, ""I have to go West?""  
""Yes, for the spirits mean have deemed it needful.  Yet,"" she pondered, ""come with me.""  
Adam followed the little girl to an abandoned house.  The house looked like it once belonged to Reverend Parris at some point.  He and his father were somewhat on the outskirts of town, so the congregation had trouble figuring out who they were at first.  Also they didn't know know the town as intimately as some of the other congregants.  

It was in the house that the little girl led him to a kitchen.  She opened up a stove and pulled out a bread that was yellow and warm to the touch.  The smell of it went up into Adam's nostrils, like a combination of corn and fresh butter was in this cake.  It was served on two green leaves, with two sticks that served as a makeshift knife and fork.  
""Fox and wolf meet at the henhouse, only to see the yellow bird.  Yet the bird is free.""  The little girl stared at Adam and placed the baked treat on the table.  ""Eat now, yellow bird.  The fox and wolf do not seek your life.""  
So Adam ate.  Yet in the back of his mind, he was thinking about his father.  ""Can my father eat of this bread too?""  
""What you eat is your share.  What is required of him will be required of you.  The fox and wolf do not dine tonight, but will hunt tomorrow.""  

""You speak riddles and play games, little girl.  I seek neither, and the fate of my father beneath the sword of Damacles.  Speak plainly or I shall bid you farewell!""
""Your firstborn will be required, young Adam,"" the girl replied.  ""The wind blows, and the bird will fly the western skies, yet his seed will scatter wheresoever the spirits will bide.""  

Adam paused in his eating of the cake.  ""Surely you must mean the Holy Spirit.  We are all at His bidding, so we are taught in the Five Tenets of Calv...""  
""The spirits are not bound to a book, Tituba says to you.""  The little girl gathered her composure.  ""The book is subject to the spirits, and so the wind will blow, the bird will fly, the beasts will run, or the father will die.""

""You mean my father?  So, I can't see him recover, is what you're saying?""  
""Go west to the golden fields, before the temple of the sun that has been smoldering from the spears of the Spaniards.  Your father will recover, but you shall not see it.  Honor his wishes, and rely on the spirits to sever the discord of his soul.""  The girl paused, and wrapped the leaves that served as his plate and put them in her mouth.  ""In fact, gather what is needful for your journey tonight, and leave before the cock crows.""

He left the house, feeling as if he had participated in some strange occult ritual.  Did he encounter an angel?  Tituba- wasn't she a servant for Reverend Parris?  He remembers Tituba from the Sunday services, and she was much older than him.  Older than his father, in fact.  There was no way the little girl was Tituba.  Plus, Reverend Parris' servant was accused of witchcraft and thrown in jail, from what Adam had heard.  There was a big uproar about it, involving the Reverend's wife and some other women in town.  

""Young Adam,"" the little girl's voice chimed in from behind him as he walked away from the Reverend's former residence, ""Beware of the black rat's bellows.  But mind the red rat's song .""  

The little John Donne, thought Adam.  Whatever she was, it was of little consequence to him at this moment.  The night was waxing, and he needed to make haste if he was going to be making his way West before sunrise.  Whether his father pulled through or not, he still needed to honor his father's wishes.  If he did make it, as the little girl had told him, maybe he could find him later in the West?  He needed to make sure he only took what he needed, leaving enough portions for his father if one day he found himself strong enough to make the trip out West.  

That's if he survived the morrow.

To your arms I entrust my unborn son, and ye shall return my sacrifice in kind.”

From an arcane circle woven with thread and blood came a cackle; one which struck fear into the heart of man and beast alike. And from a plume of ever-rising reddened smoke came a hunched figure, covered head-to-toe in dusty robes. It held an elegant staff close to its bosom, gripped tightly by an ancient wrinkled hand, and as the smoke cleared, the being reared its head.

A gaunt face, weathered by wrinkles and scars alike, teeth as yellow as the eyes which hung above. A crooked nose so sharp it was menacing in its own right.

The man across rose his voice. “Have you-”

“Silence, bastard! How dare you speak unwanted!” The walls rattled at the sound of her words. “I am Yaegid, a contract witch, why have you called upon me?”

The man shivered where he stood, too afraid to say yet another word.

“You dare waste my time?”

“No!” He stammered out words through half-clenched teeth. “I did not mean to offend you, Yaegid. I wish to make a contract, for my unborn child!”

“An unborn 'ling of flesh and bone?” Yaegid stepped closer to the man, moving with a grace that her own figure did not assume. “What is your name?”

“Robert. Robert Jenkins.”

“And what is it that you desire?”

“Courage.”

* * *

“Come witch! Scum of hell and earth alike! Heed my command! Render yourself before me and answer all it is that I desire!”

From a rusted bracelet, worn down by the sands of time came a meek laugh; one born from powerlessness and fear. From it came a wispy puff of green, which soon trailed and coiled to form the shape of first a man, then a woman. Soon, the smoke turned to flesh and bone and rags alike, and in its place stood an old woman, her entire body trembling out of fright.

“I am Junzo, a-”

The woman across from her roared. “I know what you are! I called upon you precisely because I know!”

The frail witch looked up at her with fearful eyes, afraid of her wrath. “Then you wish to make a contract?”

“For my unborn child.”

“I must know your name, for the contract.”

“Heather. Heather Robinson.”

“And what is it that you desire?”

“Empathy.”

* * *

Two months later, in the wake of autumn, the two married. Robert had gained a new sense of courage and determination and wooed the girl he had loved for years, Heather. And she in turn, learned to love his flaws and his shortcomings, not looking down on him for who he was.

Three years passed by and the contracts were almost a thought at the back of their respective minds, but something they knew they would face sooner or later. When she fell pregnant, the two fell into a state of woe and misery, but eventually, accepted it, and neither knew what the other had done.

When the time came, they were side-by-side, both ready for the inevitable. The baby entered the world, crying for its mother and father, and soon it cried no more. Through their feigned shock and horror, the sickly truth unfolded behind the scenes as the witches, together, cackled at their misfortune. 

In a sense, they both failed to fulfil their contracts, and so neither of them were fulfilled, and so as if by some divine miracle, the baby breathed once more; but the parents bore not joy, but shock and horror.

Robert lost the bravery that allowed him to court his love, and his love lost the empathy required to deal with him.

And so the two, trapped in a loveless marriage with an unwanted child, lived their days together as a spineless dog and an insufferable tyrant.

They deserved each other.

We were always homeschooled, and our moms dont really let us out much. My name is Alexander and my twin sisters name is Aleksandra.  I go by Alex, and she goes by Endra to avoid confusion. We are conjoined twins. Endra has the short end of the stick as she controls only the left arm, but she doesn't seem to mind. I've never been as good with magic, so i suppose that makes us even.

""That was a rush,"" Endra suddenly says into my ear. I cock my head slightly indicating for her to continue. ""I've been bodyjumping since this morning. First I was a bird on the windowsill, then i flew down, and became one of the normals on the street below.""

""You seem to be bodyjumping a lot lately. You've been asleep for hours."" I respond gently, careful not to wake the moms.

""I get tired of only moving one arm. It's too limiting. Don't you ever want to get away, Alex?"" She asks me in carefully hushed tones. 

""Of course, I just... I'm not as good at it as you."" I look away, glancing at our moms. Fast asleep, but I dont trust it. They have so many tricks up their sleeves. ""What happened by the way?""

Continuing this midnight saga is Grand Lord Severn and the case of the Double Promise! Now, let's get back to the action.

Severn looks between Defendant and Plaintiff

Lord Severn: ""It would be apparent to me, now, that the matter of precedent can be safely ignored as irrelevant. Do all parties agree?""

Defendant and Plaintiff agree

Lord Severn: ""Yes. I see... Let the court call the Maene family into Circle.*

Severn looks past the audience, beyond, into the shadow

Lord Severn: ""The family is present, yes?""

Marshal: ""Yes, Your Lordship. But, ah, I'm afraid they are a bit afraid of the Circle.""

Lord Severn: ""Bah, rubbish. They made a pact with two witches. What did they expect would happen when it came time to make account?""

Marshal: ""It is not my place to speculate, Your Lordship.""

Lord Severn: ""Yes yes, Saul, I perfectly understand. Good man.""

Severn stands and peers further into the night beyond the Circle

Lord Severn: ""Would Samuel Maene and Mrs. Maene please come forth to speak the truth and only the truth in this place, the Circle, so this dispute may be resolved in the matter appropriate to Circle protocol, and by their own promises made to Mrs. Hearst and Mrs. Sandorhal?""

thirty seconds pass before the Maene family appears from the night, poked along by sticks to their rear. Mrs. Maene holds her first born in a blanket to her chest as the pair stop by the Marshal's insistence between Plaintiff and Defendant

Lord Severn: ""Maene family, I thank you for appearing. Though, again, I remind you that the promises both of you have made made this appearance inevitable, it seems.""

Samuel Maene: ""Y-Yes, Your Honor.""

Marshal: ""If it please the Circle and Your Lordship, the Maene family are notified to address Grand Lord Severn in the proper title of respect in this Circle as either 'Your Lordship' or 'Grand Lord Severn'""

Severn nods. After a moment, the Maenes do as well

Lord Severn: ""Now, as all parties seem present, to this Circle's knowledge, let us gain some history. First, let it be known the true name of the offering--the first born.""

the Maenes look uncomfortable

Dolores Maene: ""His name is Peter...Your Lordship. Peter Maene.""

Lord Severn: ""And this is the true first born? I must make this inquiry against the potential of a false offering of a first born.""

the Maenes look between themselves again, unsure, then nod as one

Lord Severn: ""Very well. It is so determined and established that this is Peter Maene, first born to the Maene family. Marshal, as it has been predetermined and verified before this Circle that both promises are genuine, then I see no point in not collecting the child. It has been offered. To which party it shall go is now the crux of this proceeding.""

Marshal approaches the Maenes

Dolores Maene: ""No! You can't!""

Samuel Maene stands still, looking away

Marshal: ""It is already decided. Please, turn over the first born as the promised offering.""

Dolores Maene: ""I can't! He's my baby!""

Defendant Hearst: ""You promised me already, child!""

Plaintiff Sandorhal: ""No, they promised me, witch!""

Severn pounds on Judging Stump twice

Lord Severn: ""Order, please. I hear your argument, honored witches, and we shall soon settle the matter. Marshal?""

Marshal: ""I apologize.""

Marshal plucks the child from Dolores's arms, and carries it back, cradled in his arms to Severn's side. Samuel restrains Dolores

Lord Severn: ""A quiet child. Disciplined, or...?""

Marshal smells the child's breath

Marshal: ""A dreaming potion.""

Lord Severn: ""A kindness.""

Severn looks over the Plaintiff and Defendant

Lord Severn: ""Now, to the matter of to whom this first born is truly offered to.""

Dolores Maene: ""You can't!""

Severn pounds Judging Stump three times

Lord Severn: ""I must and I shall, Mrs. Maene. The offering has already been made; but to which party I am not sure. If you wish to see the end of this decision, you and your husband are welcome to observe; but you must do so quietly.""

the audience hangs on the drama, leaned on their benches to watch

Samuel turns and walks out of the Circle, leaving Dolores behind, weeping

Lord Severn: ""I am truly sorry, Mrs. Maene, but you made this offering, and now its time has come to pass. Stay or go? What will you choose? But choose quite soon.""

Dolores sniffles, and her shoulders sag

Dolores Maene: ""I'm sorry...""

Dolores exits the Circle

Lord Severn: ""Well, that is most disheartening.""

Defendant Hearst: ""Let us make haste deciding, Your Lordship. The dawn comes soon.""

Lord Severn: ""I will not be driven as Your Lordship in this matter, Mrs. Hearst, to a rash decision. Though...""

Severn flips through his Book, musing

Lord Severn: ""Will either of you willingly relent upon this offering?""

Defendant and Plaintiff shake their heads

Lord Severn: ""Then, as no precedent may be set, and an equal offering has been made by two parties to two honored witches, I see no other choice but the most rash one indeed, in conflicts such as these.""

the audience gasps, shocked, along with the defendants

Defendant Hearst: ""Your Lordship!""

Plaintiff Sandorhal: ""I do not argue, Your Lordship.""

Severn nods to the Marshal, who bundles the first born, Peter, tight and hands the child over to Severn. After the handover is complete, Marshal exits the Circle from the back, behind Severn, disappearing into the shadow

Severn stands, cradling the sleeping infant

Lord Severn: ""Would all parties follow me to the near riverside. If either party does not, then the party that does attend obtains their claim to the promise made. If neither party attends, then the offering is forfeited, and the promise is made null.""

Severn leads the Plaintiff and Defendant to the river bank, veiled in darkness by the shadow of the overhanging trees, followed by the audience at a respectful distance

Severn holds the child, Peter, out over the river

Lord Severn: ""Mrs. Hearst, Mrs. Sandorhal, are thee ready?""

Plaintiff and Defendant nod

Lord Severn: ""Then let the decision be cast to the currents.""

Severn tosses the child near into the middle of the river, where the first born floats for a few long seconds, and then waits

Lord Severn: ""At any time you two wish, honored wishes, you may dive in those frigid waters and rescue your offering--your new first born and future familiar servant--if you so desire it the most.""

Plaintiff and Defendant watch, but do not move, as the child is swept away by the current, almost out of sight, then goes under

Lord Severn: ""And there the child is gone.""

Plaintiff and Defendant sigh and shrug

Lord Severn: ""Then, under the light of the moon and the depth of the darkness, before the eyes of those attending the Circle, and as Your Lordship in this matter, I declare neither Mrs. Sandorhal nor Mrs. Hearst due their promised offering. The promise is now null. The child will return to its family.""

audience is completely quiet

Severn returns with Plaintiff, Defendant and audience in his wake to the Judging Stump and sits again

a minute passes

Marshal returns, soaking wet, with the first born child Peter bundled in a dry blanket in his arms. Marshal presents the child to Severn, who waves the gesture off

Lord Severn: ""Marshal, bring the child Peter to the fire to warm him back up, for the river was assuredly chilling to his young and fragile bones.""

Marshal does as Severn asks

Severn eyes Defendant and Plaintiff

Lord Severn: ""What are you two still doing here? The Circle is dismissed. Leave us, and be more wary in the future to difficult promises made.""

Plaintiff and Defendant exit the Circle

Severn considered thumping the Judging Stump, but looks at the child still asleep in Marshal's arms near the fire, and nods

Lord Severn: ""This matter before Circle I now deem fully and well resolved. Marshal, I will see myself out without a herald, thank you.""

Severn exits the Circle, disappearing back into the darkness

Announcer: ""Thank you for watching this nightly episode of Witch Court! With your favorite decider, Grand Lord Severn. Tune in next time to hear the case of the Wandering Pumpkin. Witch Court!""

""Brujeria,"" they said, looking about the landscape as they said it.  ""The one you seek is Brujeria.  ""Travel past Three Rocks and you will find her hut.  But speak to no one of your visit.""

Agueda was a young, but she knew what it meant if her mother were to die.  Mother had been sick for quite a while, and the Ayuhuasca wasn't working.  The Urarina people were dependent upon their male shamans to delve into the spirit world, and seek out that which is causing the balance to break between the life of her mother and the illness that had struck her.  But they could not make her well again.  Agueda was desperate.  At the tender age of 8, even she knew that if her mother had died, she would be alone in the village, and left to fend for herself.  
Agueda walked the forest, along the Chambira river, and spied the Three Rocks at the bend of the river.  She went straight from there and saw a makeshift hut, with a fire burning with some fish being prepared.

Agueda didn't know she was hungry until she saw the fish being cooked.  She came up to the fire and plucked a fish from the stone that sat beside the flame.  Without even thinking, she starting biting into the soft white meat of the fish, and savored every bite.  She took another bite, and another.  Before she knew it, the fish had almost been completely devoured.

""It tastes good, yes?""  A voice said behind her.
She jumped at the sound of the voice, dropping the fish in fear that she had been caught.  She at once understood the fish wasn't hers, and that she had done wrong in stealing it.  However, an old woman now held the remains of the fish, having caught it before it hit ground.  Examining it, she offered it back to Agueda.  ""No use for me now.  You take it, you finish it.""

Agueda nodded her head, and finished off what was left of the fish's meat near the tail.  The old woman eyed her, with an eye both sympathetic and yet still analyzing.  It looked as if she had seen more than her age had let on, and her hair was so grey that it almost was white when the sun rays came through some of the trees to illuminate it.  The sinews of her arm looked like a withered tree branch, but in them she felt there was a strength that was beyond that of the strongest of men in her village.  This was the Brujeria.  She spoke up to the strange woman, shyly given what she had just done.  ""I'm sorry elder.  I was just so hungry....""
""The spirits told me,"" the Brujeria said, interrupting.  ""And I was happy to oblige.  It is a small thing for me to offer one so young, that has traveled so far from the village to seek one that should not be sought.""

As Agueda looked into her eyes deeper, she saw that there was a faint glow that almost whited her pupils.  Was the Brujeria in a trance?  Was she seeing both her and the spirit world, speaking to both at the same time?  Agueda knew at once that the old woman knew what she had come to her for.

""Yes, I do."" Replied the Brujeria.  The old woman sat down on a log beside the fire, and began eating the other fish that was on the stone.  ""Again, they told me.  The Ayuhuasca does not work, they said.  These are only plants that do not speak to the will of the the spirits that house them.  Drink this.""  

Agueda looked to the fire that the Brujeria had pointed to and saw a makeshift pot with a brew boiling.  It was Ayuhuasca, but it smelled different than the ones that the village shamans prepared.  This boiled with a certain glow to it, and it smelled sweeter.  Was this an attempt to steal her energy?  Her mother had always warned her about the dangerous Brujos that wanted nothing more than the life force of the ones that drank before them.  

""I am not some fiendish Brujo as they say, child,"" said the old woman. ""The old ones know better, but I have been here because I need to be. I have need to study this book given by a man, and every eye in the village has sought to peek into its pages.  Yet it is not for them, lest they summon curses to their souls that no healer can repair.  So I stay here, for their sake, not just my own.""  

Agueda looked at the book that the elder produced on her lap.  The book was as tattered as the rags that she was wearing, but there was no mistaking that the air around this book brought a certain chill to her bones that the fire could hardly warm.  Could this woman be the Warlock of Chiloe?  Agueda once heard stories of the power of this person, but she had always assumed the warlock was a man.  
""Even so, child,"" the woman said, ""Yours is a life already set on its course.  The spirits are gathering far beyond the Chambira, to a land where men who walk as armored spirits after they have set their flaming spears against the people of the sun.  To that land, you must travel, in due time.  Even so, your mother must needs be saved. So...""  

The old woman closed her eyes, as if thinking or communing with the world beyond what she Agueda could see.  Her hand was upon the book, as if pulling information from its pages without opening it.  Was it the spirits she was communing with, or the power that resided in the book that was convincing her?  
""They will save your mother, but they require more than what you can offer today.  Today they will sever the discord of her spirit, but tomorrow the spirit of another will be required.  Yet, they are not asking for yours, as you will travel to the temple of the sun and see the demise of a people before passing the great river to the golden fields.  They require..""

*""In the year of our Lord, 1716, in the town of San Antonio, and truly the Lord has blessed our family with abundance.  To add to that, my wife seems to be going through the first signs of being with child.  A marvelous blessing indeed!""*  

Adam wrote with quill his final thoughts, waxed a seal to an envelope and made ready to send the letter off to his father, hoping that it would never reach him, because his father was making his way west.  Agueda was certainly showing signs of having a child, but for some reason she seemed worried.  It wasn't so long ago that she stumbled upon his little plantation, half-starved from a grueling trip from someplace a greater distance from here.  She probably saw the ruins of the Aztecs after the Spanish had gone through the area.  He too was curious about what was happening further south, but didn't have the opportunity to make his way there because of the heavy rains.  

There was also a bit of a language barrier between the two of them.  Adam was trying to teach her English as much as he could, so she could speak with some of the other settlers.  She did her best to cook for him, even though he wasn't too keen on some of the strange plants she brought home to cook.  

""Roasted cactus again?  Oh, my dear, you sure are a blessing to a famished appetite!""  
Agueda smiled at Adam as she served the cactus to him on a clay plate, then returning to the stove to stir the pot of herbs she had collected earlier in the day.  
""My dear,"" Adam chimed in, while holding up a cactus piece with a fork and a puzzled look on his face. ""I don't mean to be rude, but you do remember we have a garden, right?  I mean, there's no need to be foraging when we have crops to sustain us...""  
""Shhh!"" Agueda motioned to him. ""We eat of all the earth, not just this one.  More land than here, so we take it all in, and it takes us all in.  One day we join it, become one.""  
""Okay...""  Adam resigned, attempting to chew on the cactus his wife had so lovingly fetched for him.  
""Oh!"" Cried Agueda.  ""I feel the child, his soul stirs within mine!""  
The baby was starting to kick and move within Agueda.  Adam smiled.  ""I'm hoping for a son.  He'll shoulder the cross as his father did, and his father before him, and his grandfather did when he first set foot on this soil from England.""  
""A son is good.""  Agueda said agreeing.  ""He will carry the strength of his father and ancestors, and make their spirits proud.""  

They embraced.  They kissed.  Agueda felt safe in Adam's arms.  A safety she hadn't felt in such a long time.  The journey north was indeed grueling, fleeing the Mayans and seeing the Spanish decimate them, then seeing the Aztecs getting wiped out and their shrines set on fire.  She wondered if the cruelty of the Spanish would visit the three rivers, and upon the Urarina people.  Then she thought about the warlock, and the deal that was made.  She shook her head as she nuzzled into Adam's chest.  This wasn't the time to be thinking about such things. Now was a time of peace, a moment of safety, a chance occasion of respite from the storms that came with life in this transitional time.  
Even so, she felt a looming danger just waiting around the corner.

'Not yet.' I replied. 'It's been strictly nightmares for this Eater. I am curious though, maybe a little apprehensive. I mean like...What do I say? Do I have to scare them or is there protocol?'

'Dude. You have no skin on your face, it's literally a skull. They'll just see your shiny white mug and be scared shitless.'

'Thanks for the confidence.'

'Besides, a child's soul is like a natural aphrodisiac, you and the missus would be back on track in no time!'

'I don't know Michael... she's just... I just don't feel the same way anymore, since she got all biblical on me last time we-'

I began to feel the pull, the call to the human world, we would have to continue our chat another time. 

'Michael, I'm-'

'I know, you're legs are already fading away, I hope you get a soul anyway, I'll see you when get back Azar.'

'See you later Mich-'

My words drifted off into nothing as my world slowly faded to black. I could hear the echo of child's voice.

'Eater...Eater.' 

I felt the warm snuggle of shaggy carpet creep between my toes. The desperate stench of Axe body spray pulled at where my nose used to be, this was a boys room.

I looked around to see posters of strange symbols, one poster showed a warning, stating there was ""a gamer"" around and that he was not to be disturbed. I assumed I would have to be careful as I ate this gamers nightmares, for I would not know what terrors he would unleash if he was to be awoken. 

He had called twice, so I set about my calling, placing my hands either side of his sleeping face. I then began to breath in his nightmares, it tasted like embarrassment, maybe a no pants nightmare, a taste all too common in my line of work. 

I was almost finished when he spoke again. 

'Eater...Eater' 

I felt emotion well up inside me, I wished I did not have to make this kid hollow. But he had crossed the threshold, I was to take a soul tonight. 

'Holy shit' I whispered. It tasted like happiness, love, innocence, all feelings I had forgotten since I became an Eater. It was incredible. 

I raised my hands to face, the touch was different, there was no scratch of bone against bone, it was warm and soft. My skin...my skin was back. 

'AHAH!' I leaped into the air, throwing my arms up in joy. 'Thanks kid! You've made me one happy agent of Satan!'

'You're welcome...I guess.' The voice was not my own, it was high pitched and innocent. I did not hear it from outside the room, it came from within...it came from inside my mind.

'Hi I'm David, nice to meet you.'

I liked the idea of Satan approaching souls on their way to hell and offering them a place among the demons as part of a ""community outreach"" program where he tries to give back to the people of Earth for providing him with so many souls for Hell.

_____

Alice, quite simply, had troubles. The doctors could never figure out what was wrong, but in hushed whispers amongst the nurses and orderlies, the truth, in a manner, slipped out. The wonders she regaled her few visitors with, in her rare lucid moments, couldn't help but slip out and spread in rumors. After all, it is only fitting that such a sense of Wonder couldn't be contained in one person alone. 

When Alice was but a child, she was plagued by nightmares, of talking Chesire cats and Hatters mad, the furious Queen and Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee. When she met the caterpillar, she begged for reprieve, that the dream had become maddening and she wanted but to wake. And so, the caterpillar, referred her to the monster, the Jabberwock. 

With jaws that bite and claws that catch, and eyes of flame, the Jabberwock was certainly born of nightmares. And with help from Alice, the Jabberwock roamed free in Wonderland once again, and in one bite devoured the Cat, another the Hatter and his party, and in a third the Queen's Court was but a light dusting of red. Grateful, Alice said, she needed now to wake, and in a fourth bite, the Jabberwock ate her too. And when Alice awoke, she wasn't who she was before, a hollow shell of what once was, what once could be. 

And now she languishes, in that horrid place, and babbles until the nurses take pity and sedate her, baffling doctors with her tales of Wonderland and how she burned it to the ground. But on that Frabjous Day, Callooh, Callay, Alice might return with the Vorpal Sword, and in a snicker-snack, take the Jabberwock's head and free us from the nightmare she created. ",Alcyius

[WP] You and your crew come across a debris field in space. Amid the scattered ship parts you find a small asteroid and are surprised by what’s on it.,you-are-lovely,"The story begins in the fourth century after the fall of our dear leader, Kim Jong Un, who died tragically of suffocation when he mistook an American baseball for a cream puff. Following this sabotage, our North Korean ancestors waged a successful attack against the saboteurs, the people of the United States of America, overtaking all 50 states and demolishing the baseball stadiums therein.

Besides sweet revenge, the greatest prize pried from this victory was the Americans'  massive reservoir of space technology and knowledge, including the many brilliant American astrophysicists and test monkeys that dedicated their lives, willingly or not, to the exploration of the endless, unfathomable beyond: space.

Now, in current times, the Dear Leader, Kim Jong Fun, has built upon the most unimpressive legacy of the great American space camp, NASA (since renamed ""Rockets and Stuff"" or ""R&amp;S""), and are currently midway through the launch of their 15th deep space rocket, ""The Fun Rocket,"" upon which presides me, my North Korean colleagues, and two chattering monkeys.


""We are approaching the debris now,"" I advise my shipmates.

We had spotted the debris from miles out and were debating a course of action. My co-pilot, Citizen#17648, had recommended continuing past the debris, which he suggested were the remains of a failed American launch undertaken centuries before the Great Revolution. He reasoned we had only eighty years to spare and the Dear Leader would stand for no delays in his campaign to subdue and conquer the Neptunian people. The debris was a minor and unimportant distraction, like the desire for free will.

However, my other colleague, Citizen#17649, argued more successfully for a maneuver that would set us on course toward the debris. He reminded us of the Dear Leader's proclamation to ""wipe out any remaining American presence, on Earth, in space, or otherwise."" The ""otherwise"" bit was always befuddling, but this situation clearly called for investigation into a potential ""American space zombie situation,"" as Citizen#17649 put it.


As we neared the debris, we identified a singular asteroid amid the wreckage. Two golden arches sprouted upward from the asteroid.

""What is that? It cannot be!"" exclaimed Citizen#17650.

I was aghast. My colleagues were aghast. The monkeys were chattering.

""Just as the Dear Leader's vision foretold,"" I remarked.

Our suspicions had been confirmed. Upon this lone asteroid, an American zombie colony had formed. In a cramped village square, there existed the trinity of American nationalism: a McDonald's, a Starbucks, and a baseball stadium.

Suddenly, The Fun Rocket began to shake, rattled by a frenzied din of bangs and clangs.

""The Americans are attacking, and they have baseball bats!"" shouted Citizen#17649. 

Flanking our rocket was a small army of American zombie astrophysicists, wielding baseball bats and chanting about Cracker Jacks. 

""We must return home and warn the Dear Leader of this discovery,"" I ordered. 

The Fun Rocket was holding up well against the onslaught, but damage to the $45 trillion dollar vessel could not be risked.

""I'm fine, it doesn't move fast. I want to see what it'll do when it realizes it doesn't have a solid destination.""

""This is amazing, Lorenz. It can maneuver in zero-g with directed propellant jets, just like our MMUs. I wonder how they work? Does it have multiple systems with different specific impulses and thrust limits? Where does it refine the propellant from?""

""That's nice, Garcia. We can wonder about that once we contain it and figure out what it did to Mendel.""

""Yeah, that fascinates me too. It has some kind of bioluminescing organs under the tentacles. They would have been right in Mendel's face when it latched onto his helmet. I still haven't figured out how it did that bit, either - there's no visible damage to the suit. Do van der Waals forces work in a vacuum?""

""Garcia! Focus! Contain the entity, rescue the crewmate, *then* do research.""

""Alright, fine. Who has the net?""

""Damien. He'll be here in a minute. In the mean time, get your tether on Mendel and sling him over to me so we can haul him back.""

""As you command, *mon capitan.* I'd keep an eye on that 'entity', though. Don't let it get too close.""

""Roger that.""

""Lorenz? Do you have Mendel on a tether yet?""

""I do now. Garcia, prepare to haul this comatose lump. MMU thrusters to 150%.""

""MMU thrust increased. Preparing to haul payload 'comatose lump'. Hey, watch out--!""

""Shit, I felt that! Where is it?!""

""It's still on the back of your leg, but it's heading upward!""

""Shit, get it off! Get it off!""

""Hold still, Lorenz. Squirming in an EVA suit won't help anyone.""

""Shut up, Damien. Just net the damn thing already!""

""Net away. Target net-ralized.""

""My god, Damien, really?""

""I'm just that good.""

""Fuck off. Are you at least using the high-tensile line?""

""Yeah, I heard you talking about its propulsive capability. Don't worry your little head, Garcia. This critter ain't going nowhere.""

""Has anyone ever told you you're a pretentious douche, Damien?""

""All of you quit your space hooliganism and return immediately. Get Mendel in the medical ward and keep that damn creature in the empty unpressurized cargo bay. Once it's in captivity, Garcia can study it to her heart's content while we figure out what it did to Mendel...and Damien brags about how brave he was in capturing the vicious space alien. If you're lucky, they'll name it after one of you. (But I hope to god not Damien.)""",Hlothwig

"[WP] A person blinded their whole life sees for the first time, only to go blind again instantly",CisScumOverlord,"A gentle touch awakens me, not that it matters i can't see anything anyway.

Hello, Mr Jones is everything ok?

For some reason my eyes feel, lighter.

""Yeah i'm alright Jackie, just another day and i'm not getting any younger.'

Jackie's my nurse, she's looked after me for majority of my life. I remember as a child when my parents lived in the country, Jackie would take me through the paddock to play with our family pet, good times. Although there was a period of my life that she disappeared for a while and i relied on my stick, but then out of the blue she came back but it was never the same.

I rub my hands over my eyes, i feel my old frail skin run over my eyelids. Something feels really bizarre today. I feel around for the end of the bed for my stick. My fingertips touch my stick only to fall over and hit the floor.

""A day in the life of a blind person right?"" I think to myself.

Jackie helps pickup the walking stick off the floor and gently places it in my hand. As her hand touches mine, my eyes slowly fade to colour, a trinkle of light and shapes appear before me.

""What the hell is this place?"" I say 

My eyes quickly jet around the room, all i see is shiny stainless steel appliances and robots engineered with human faces.

""This isnt my nursing home!Where's Jackie?"" I shout at the robot

""It's me, Ray. I'm right here."" The robot replies.

I try to push Jackie away, my hand smothers her face in my first attempt. As i try again my eyes turn black as soon i touch Jackie.

The darkness returns, here i am laying in a life surrounded by lies thinking i was in a nursing home. 

Modern times are changing and i need to get the hell out of here.

"[WP] A person blinded their whole life sees for the first time, only to go blind again instantly",CisScumOverlord,"It is always scary to be awake during an operation. I was lying down on the operating table and saw nothing but blackness. This was because I was blind my entire life. My parents and even my doctors could not give me an adequate reason as to why this was so, other than ""It was God's will"" or ""Because the writing prompt already set a predetermined condition on the main character"". But I never really understood any of their explanations.

Finally, my ophthalmologist told me that there was a way to cure my blindness through the use of microsurgery. The surgeon would operate a micro machine using a control set that looked a lot like a Wii U gamepad. The tiny robotic arms would then manipulate the bits and pieces in my eyeballs and restore my vision. Finally, after an extensive 3 hours of surgery, the surgeon breathed a sigh of relief and suddenly light filled my eyes. It was a beautiful sight. Partly because I was still high from the cocaine anaesthetic that the doctor used in my eyes, but also partly because I had never seen anything before in my life. But a few seconds later my vision went dark again. I was rushed to the emergency department and I later found out that I had suffered an ischaemic stroke that affected my entire occipital lobe. It turned out that not only was I blind, but I also suffered from atrial fibrillation and a clot had escaped from my fibrillating heart and got lodged in one of the arteries feeding my brain.

I must end my verbal journal entry now because the doctor is about to provide me with some information on anticoagulating drugs. I think I might pick one of the newer oral anticoagulants like rivaroxaban instead of warfarin.

"[WP] In a world where everyone is constantly stoned, you become sober for the first time in your life.",CisScumOverlord,"                         I questioned life often, thinking to myself, ""What am I here for? Is my purpose really just to live on day in and day out? I was more. I need more"" My parents were of course worried about me, I asked more questions than I should. At my age, students just learn to keep their mouth shut and do what their told. But I always knew I was.....different.

                       Imagine little me, in the sixth grade, happy go lucky Dawson, just doing what kids do! Getting muddy, hanging with friends, and the usual knee scrape every once in a while. That day started as any other, get up, go to school, have the first transfusion at 9:00 and then go to my favorite teacher Mrs. Hamilton. My god, that Mrs. Hamilton.  Was she a bit old? Sure! But I don't know, our personalities just clicked. Like, in a friendly way. She was just so nice, and understanding of people. Not like the other people who were forced to work there. It's like she *wanted* to be around kids. I guess she just got lucky when the government leased her to the school. She knew I was a trouble maker. That's why she liked me so much. She would tell me these intriguing stories about how she used to be a waitress back in 2037, and about how people used to have these certain rights, and freedoms. It all sounded amazing to me, I was constantly enamored by the thought of a busy city, or hiking, or just being able to go where my heart desired! Now it's just a bunch of assignments. One family assigned here, another there. All in a uniform mess of unhappy faces. But at the time, I didn't affect me much, I was just in the sixth grade after all, my family had already been assigned to the farm, so that's where we stayed. At least we were together.


                         I don't like talking about *that* day. I still have nightmares about it. But I'll manage I guess for this interview. It's still so vivid, and quiet.  Very quiet. It was usually quiet at school, but this was off. I knew something was wrong after our first transfusion. I was still kind of hazy and slow from the initial prick, but in that hazy blur, I saw Mrs. Hamilton being taken away by Legionaries. She was crying ""I didn't mean too! I didn't know! Please, I want to see my class. I want to see my children. PLEASE!!"" 

                         She rushed toward me in a burst of energy! She moved faster than normal. Especially for someone her age. She sprinted to me, as fast as she could and........ *ahem*. Sorry, sometimes it's hard to tell this part. Give me a second please. 


     Okay. Yes, I'm fine now. Anyway, she whispered something in my ear, the way she spoke was so clear and concise. I picked up everything. 

       ""Dawson, don't trust them! Don't trust anybody. They are poisoning you. You can do great things! Please promise me that.................""

    Then the blood flowed.  It was thick. I had never seen so much. 

      Did I cry? No! Of course not. They would have killed me too. 

      The rest of that day didn't matter to me. No one said a word. It was like nothing even happened. Mrs. Hamilton, if only I had known. I could have done something!! I could have....

    (Interviewer)
       Dawson, stick to the story. Don't get off track. We are on are time limit. Remember?

                       I know, I know. It's just hard sometimes. Well, let's fast foward to my 9th grade year. Finally, only four more years of schooling left until I'm picked for my official title. Any kid wants to move on to the big house. The Advanced Placement Academy. I didn't have a very nice ring to it, no, but it was where all of the geniuses went. Or, you know, who we thought were geniuses at the time. I didn't know it then, but that's just where they dosed up the really smart kids so they couldn't do any harm to the ""Grand Plan"". But I'll save that part for a second. I was now in Upper Class, 9-12 years. I was ready to tackle the large educational challenges! Most kids gave up and just got and auto-assign at year 8, but I at least wanted a smart place in society.  So yes, ready for educational challenges, but the physical ones were something u were terrified of. I was told the larger doses get you really sick, like to the point of not eating for days. I was told it could kill me. But I took the dose with my future, and Mrs. Hamilton, in mind. For a while I felt like I normally do. But right before lunch, it hit me with the force I have never felt before. I went home moody, and crying, and sick, and I felt like I was dying from the inside out.

                              After many hours of throwing up and crying I finally went to sleep. But my holophone decided to piss me off just that much more by sending me a god damn message at 4 in the morning. I had only got one hour of sleep! I hated it when the government decided to send a mass message at hours like that. Why couldn't it just wait until tomorrow... It was probably just another dumb financial change to the parents. 


                              The next morning, I finally look at the message. I was already pissed, because I only had two hours of sleep that night. I put all emotion aside. What I read, made me void of emotion. 
   
                               ""Meet me Dawson.  I need help from you. It's about Hamilton. I'll be at the barn, by the school. 7:00""

                                The message isn't what chilled me. It's how they sent it. Our messages were monitored 24/7 and most of what gets sent are financial records, or recent purchases. How did this person contact me? Was it a government official? Well, if it was a government official I wasn't about to disobey and get killed. So I went, I was terrified, I didn't know what to do. 

                                It was a woman. In a black, well, everything. Hoodie, gloves, shoes, pants. She didn't want me to see her face. Or go near her. She only told me to listen. And not to speak a word. Which is fine, it was something I was used to

                                 ""Mrs Hamilton was murdered exactly three years ago today. You know this. She saw you as an ally. She saw you as a friend. Until she was silenced. Was it Legionaries?""

                                   Under all of the professionalism, she sounded emotional. I understand why. She knew my friend back in Middle School. I guess she was her friend too.

I sat down in one of the bean bag chairs and he put on the usual, a four hour block of killer cartoons. As my friends all giggled and laughed, I seemed less enthused than usual by the literal cat and mouse chase on the television set. I became aware of how dark the room always is and asked my bros

""Hey, do you guys think I can take the sheet down and let a little light in?""

They responded with a shrug that I knew meant they didn't care either way, as long as they weren't the one who had to get up and do it. Before I could get to the window someone suggested we go get some grub instead. Everyone let out a ""duudee"" in unison acknowledging this apparently genius and somehow revolutionary idea. The three of them went to their respective rooms to put on a fresh (well, less stained at least) tie-dye Phish t shirt.  We all piled in his mom's minivan and began to head towards the usual spot, Taco Bell.

We crawled down the road 15mph under the speed limit until we reached a stop sign. The driver proceeded to look around for about half a minute then wait. I realized what was happening and pointed out to the driver ""Stop waiting for it to turn green. You do know that's a stop sign right?""

""Oh shit man you're totally right haha"" he laughs as he turns the music back up letting us know its the best part. We know it's the best part. Everyone knows the guitar solo is the best part of any Pink Floyd song. I try to ask if he has any other music besides 50 minute long psychedelic concept albums and everyone gives me a dirty look for talking over Gilmour's magic finger work in Comfortably Numb.

As we pull up to the drive thru, there appears to be only one car in front of us. Twenty minutes later it's our turn and nobody in the car knows what to order. They eventually figure it out and when it's my turn I just order a single crunchy taco. 

One of my mates asks, ""Hey are you feeling alright? Usually you order 6 tacos, two of each kind of Doritos Locos man!""

I explain I'm just not that hungry and he quizzically looks me over then moves on. We all break out our spare change and wait for the employee behind the window to count it all. It only takes 10 minutes since he managed to only start over twice, which was impressive. 

We park in the Taco Bell parking lot and continue to listen to music, now Bob Marley.  I take a bite of my taco. Mediocre at best. That's when it hits me: cartoons not hilarious, Floyd and Marley not mind-blowing, Taco Bell not the shit...

Greg rolls his cigarette on a desk cluttered with beer cans and tissues--the detritus of two weeks of spring break and RedTube.

""Ugh. Don't make me guess,"" I plead.

I take the finished cigarette from Greg, careful to avoid the brutalized Kleenex, and run the flame along the seam. He's one of those guys who always uses too much spit, and I'm not keen to suck on his slobber.

""Don't be a douche, Bee. Just guess already.""

""Fuck. Fine. Whatever. Okay.""

The cigarette is as dry as it's gonna get, so I light up, trying to think of something to say. If there's something remarkable about Greg, it's hidden *deep*. He lives in layers of ratty band tees, pisses all over the side of the toilet, and only leaves the house when he's out of tobacco. This is a man who once spent *an entire week* in bed watching ""Legends of the Hidden Temple."" By day three there were piss bottles flanking the box spring. Fuck knows how he handled the other function. 

The cigarette is half gone and I've still got nothing.

""You're ... impervious to hangovers,"" I guess.

He flicks a tissue off the desk. ""Nah. But that would be a good one! I'd take that."" 

The tissue floats to the ground, nesting in a greyish clump of cat hair. 

""Guess again.""

I *really* hate these guessing games.

""This is some dad-grade shit, Greg. Just *tell* me already.""

""One more guess,"" he promises. He's loving this. Eating it up. I swear, that asshole gets off on driving people crazy.

""Fuck. I don't know. Your jizz melts steel beams.""

""A *serious* guess, Bee."" He wrinkles his nose at me.

""Who says that wasn't serious?"" 

I finish the cigarette, stub it out in the overburdened ash tray. Greg rolls another.

""Just one more guess,"" he says more softly, and I can tell it's something else. Something serious.

I sigh. I guess.

""You can ... read minds?""

""Closer."" Greg finishes rolling the cigarette, tucking it behind his ear. I can see the faint tattoo that's nestled in the conch: a faded heart, broken in two. He says he got it after first his girlfriend forgot him. Did it himself. Too cheap to pay for the real thing, I guess.

""So tell me,"" I say. 

He smiles. ""But I already did."" 

""What?""

He reaches forward to brush my bangs from my face, and the touch ignites a shock of familiarity. My mouth is full of the stale film of cigarette. 

""I tell you every year, Bee, but you always forget.""

""Uh huh,"" I roll my eyes. ""Because that's something I'd forget. You having a fucking super power."" 

""You do. Because that *is* my super power.""

""Quit the cryptic bullshit, Greg. We've been friends for ... what ..."" I grope backward along the relationship timeline. When did we move in together? Three years ago? Four?  

He watches me struggle for a while, then shakes his head. ""Don't bother, Bee."" 

""But why would you make me forget?"" I insist.

""I don't,"" he says. ""... You just ... *do*."" His eyes lock with mine for a minute, reading me. ""Everyone forgets.""

Ugh. ""So what if I say I don't believe it?""

""You never do."" 

""Fuck, Greg. This is stupid."" I can feel myself getting angry, and it's not a feeling I treasure. I need a glass of water and a walk.

""Hang on,"" he says, and his hand is on my wrist. It's a gentle grab, though, and I let it soothe the anger a little. I let him guide me back into the chair. A tumbleweed of cat hair flees from my feet. Greg grabs a compact and opens it up, rubbing the mirrored half clean on his sleeve. 

""Look,"" he says, and angles the mirror at my head. 

There, in the tiny well of my conch, I see the black ink of a heart--faded, but whole.

""You might forget,"" he says, ""but I remember.""

I sink further into the chair. 

""But ...""

""It's okay,"" he says. His hands are already busy with another cigarette. ""Everyone forgets.""

I thieve the cigarette from behind his ear and light it, thinking hard. Shouldn't I be afraid? Or at least freaked out? But there's something there, padding the shock. An echo of a conversation forever playing in my mind. Instead of confusion, I feel ... a weird relief. 

""Why am I not losing it right now?"" I ask.

""Because we've had this conversation like ... a million times. And eventually you *do* remember. For a while."" He smiles. ""For long enough.""

""So, what,"" I say. ""We're in love or something?""

""Or I erased your memory and planted the tattoo.""

""Greg, buddy."" I catch his smile. ""We both know you're too fucking lazy for that.""

Back then he was always the clean cut, wholesome-looking guy who could charm the pants off any woman in the county.  I guess that’s why I started hanging out with him in the first place.  Always hoped some of his charm might rub off on me.

&amp;nbsp;

Somewhere along the way something went wrong with Chuck.  Badly wrong.  We lived together so I used to talk to him every day, even if it’s just a quick greeting in the hall.  Even I never knew what was eating him.  All I could have told you is that he got out of bed around the time I get back from work and when I woke up in the morning he was usually sprawled out on the couch with a bottle of hard liquor in his hand and a look on his face that says he wanted to forget the world.

&amp;nbsp;

I asked him why he was drinking alone so early in the morning once.  I tried not to sound judgemental but I’m sure I did.  His only response was to roll up the leg of his pants and point to an angry, blood soaked red welt on his leg.  It looked real bad.

&amp;nbsp;

“Do you need to go to the hospital?” I’d asked with rising panic.

&amp;nbsp;

“Nah, this is all the painkiller I need,” he replied taking another swig straight from the bottle.

&amp;nbsp;

I got more observant after that night.  I’d already known Chuck spent most of the hours between sunrise and sunset out on the town.  What I hadn’t realised was just how many bar fights and little ‘accidents’ he stumbled into.  Now that I was looking it seemed like he came home with a new injury almost every day.

&amp;nbsp;

He shrugged off questions about his drinking and he got outright angry when I pointed out all the harm it was causing him.

&amp;nbsp;

“It’s none of your business,” he snarled, “they’re just minor scrapes and the alcohol takes my mind off them, all right?”

&amp;nbsp;

I’d backed down real quick.  Chuck was a big man and even with his erratic lifestyle lately he still looked strong enough to crush my skull one handed if it ever took his fancy.

&amp;nbsp;

“Ok, I miss the old Chuck though,” I told him as I walked away.  It felt like I was living with the ghost of my old friend.

&amp;nbsp;

Nothing surprised me more than when he came knocking at my door the next evening.  There were tears glistening in his eyes.  It struck me all at once how utterly exhausted he looked.

&amp;nbsp;

“I’m sorry about earlier,” he mumbled.  Coming from someone as proud as Chuck, those were heavy words.

&amp;nbsp;

“I’m just worried about you, man.  You’ve been acting so strange the last few months coming and going in the middle of the night, sleeping all day.  Why don’t you stay in tonight?  We can watch a movie or something.  Just the two of us, bud.  Like old times.”

&amp;nbsp;

“I…that sounds great…but I can’t.  I need to go,” he replied.  He took a step forward as if to hug me but thought better of it at the last moment.  “I need to go.  I’m sorry.”

&amp;nbsp;

I went to bed troubled.  I knew Chuck was out roaming the city bars again.  I was tempted to follow him.  In the end it was his business though.  I’d offered what I could and he’d refused.

&amp;nbsp;

The next morning I woke to the headline screaming out from every newspaper, TV channel and radio station.  “Masked Avenger Gives Life To Save City From Destruction!”.  When Chuck never came home I knew.",herd_of_birds

He would not have to wait much longer, and soon he could return to the Temple of Four Fishes, where he belonged. But first, he had to retrieve the sacred Goblet of Ysandr, the Second Fish, from the infidels.

Soon enough, he heard tiny pebbles bounce and click along the stone passageway as booted feet lurched toward the forest outside. Tharr readied his sword, his muscles tensing.

A dark head emerged from the hidden passageway, and the figure stumbled toward the trees, fumbling with the laces of its breeches. The boy never knew he was there, and slipped silently to the ground when the pommel of Tharr’s sword knocked him neatly out. 

Tharr tied and gagged him, then dragged him just inside the forest line. He doubted the others would notice anything amiss in their inebriated state, but the Sisters had taught him to be cautious.

Within an hour, he had a pile of unconscious bandits. After dispatching the last two, who had emerged wondering where everyone else had gone to, he decided the lair below was probably safe enough to enter. 

Tharr had good night vision, and needed no torch. He entered the passageway without fear, placing his feet carefully to make no sound. After a few minutes, light spilled onto the passage wall, and he could hear snores from several mouths. The singing, thankfully, was done. He slowed his pace, stopping just short of the entrance to the inner lair. He listened for several moments, but heard no movement.

All senses alert, his sword ready, he left the passageway. The room he entered was large, oblong, and full of sleeping thieves. The torches along the stone walls burned low. A long trestle table across from him was covered with food and drink, and he quickly spied his prize, tilting precariously in the loose grip of a sleeping thief.

The Goblet of Ysandr, the Second Fish, was perhaps the least impressive of the four sacred cups. The goblets were all fish, with tails for stems and open mouths for cups. But while the others were silver, gold, and crystal, the Second Fish’s cup was copper tinged green with age. It looked old and worn. But while it was last in beauty, it was first in importance. Spring would not arrive without the proper ceremonies, and these thieves had looted the temple two days after Ysandr’s goblet had been displayed in preparation for what was to come.

Tharr made his way across the room, careful not to step on any of the prone bodies. He stopped before the goblet and saw that it was half full of wine. He frowned in disapproval. 

The man holding the goblet was asleep, his head resting on the table. He wore robes of midnight blue, spangled with gaudy yellow stars. Tharr knew he must be careful, for the man was a mage, and probably the leader of the group. He had no defenses against mages, apart from prayer. 

Dutifully, he sent a wisp of a prayer down to Ysandr, and set his hands upon the goblet. He pulled gently, and the cup came free. He waited with bated breath, but the mage merely snorted. 

“Oh no,” a voice said. “Not you! Help! Help!”

The time for stealth was over. Tharr made a run for it, wine spilling everywhere. Behind him, he heard shouting and movement as the thieves awoke. He was nearly at the passageway when he saw the first spell zoom past him and knock a chip out of the wall. He ducked into the passageway and ran for the world above, a pack of thieves in hot pursuit.

“Save me,” someone screamed nearby. “That was the first wine I had in hundreds of years!”

Tharr burst into the chilly night air, breath steaming, and sprinted for his horse. 

“Wake up, you fools!” The screaming seemed to be following him, but Tharr didn’t have time to think about it. He ducked into the trees and quickly found his horse, setting the goblet on the ground with an apology to Ysandr so he could untether the animal.

“They’re right behind you!” someone shouted. “They have arrows! Just go! And leave the cup!”

“By the Holy Fish, I cannot,” groaned Tharr, snatching up the goblet. He leapt onto the horse and dug his heels into its side. It screamed, reared, and shot off through the woods.

“Damn it,” he heard from his lap. Tharr looked down, and saw the goblet move. “What are you looking at, you great blond sissy?” it said.

“My God!” exclaimed Tharr, thunderstruck.

“Yes, it’s Me,” said the cup. “Now stop this horse.”

Tharr reined in the horse, listening for the bandits. He heard nothing behind him.

“That’s better. Now listen…”

But Tharr was not listening. He was praying. “Great Ysandr, your waters flow sweet. They feed the trees and the grasses; they warm the stones of the rivers. They freshen the winds…”



“LISTEN!” shouted the goblet. Tharr reluctantly fell silent.

“Tharr, isn’t it?

“Yes, O great Ysandr, whose power helps turn the world, whose…”

“Yes, yes,” snapped the goblet. “What exactly are you doing?”

“I have retrieved you from the unholy brigands who took you, and I vow I will return you to your rightful place at the Temple of the Four Fishes.”

“No, don’t do that, it’s very boring there. Nine months in a box, three months on a dias. Never any wine. Take me to an inn.”

“It is my holy duty--”

A tree exploded next to them, and the horse screamed and plunged forward. “Beavers,” Tharr swore, and held tight to the reins. He could hear the goblet muttering, but the noise of their passage made it impossible to hear.

His horse was the finest mount the Temple could provide. Fast and fearless it galloped through the forest, untiring. The moon rose, full and white, illuminating their path. 

After several hours Tharr reined it to a brisk walk. “I think we have left them behind.”

“Great,” grumbled the cup. “How far are we from the Temple?”

“A few hours’ ride,” said Tharr kindly. “Do not fret.”

“Look, Tharr. I don’t want to go back to the Temple.”

“If you do not go back, spring will never arrive. You know this.”

“Well… that might not be entirely true. Someone might have exaggerated, a bit.”

“Of course it is true,” Tharr said. “It is written.”

“How do you know? Only the Sisters can read!”

“I do not need to read. I have faith.”

“I tell you what,” said the cup. “If you agree to never take me back there, I’ll shower you with riches beyond your wildest dreams. And beautiful women! You have no idea what to do with one, but you can learn!”

“You speak of temptation,” said Tharr coldly. “I suspect the mage enchanted you. Ysandr would never speak of such corruption.”

“All right, all right,” said the goblet. “No riches or women, I get it. You’re a stick in the mud. But maybe pour some wine in me? Just at the ceremonies?”

Tharr began to weep. Ysandr was tainted. “I must tell the Sisters to melt you down and restrike you, that you be cleansed.”

“Your mother was a goat!” yelled the cup. “She ate your father’s trousers! I’ll get you for this! I curse you for a hundred years! No, a thousand!”

Tharr thrust the cup into his saddlebags. His spirits began to lift. Soon, spring would come.",bluemouse79

Stupid sword, want me to give him to some elf warrior, in middle of human and kobold country. Weak human wield him and drive human insane. Sword not stop talking since day Gornak find.

I sneak past small village, stupid sword yell for help. Gornak talk down village leader, reasonable human and not weak. Stupid sword forget Gornak is legendary warrior and hero. Next time sword try to insult weak human and his bodyguards. Some weak noble boy and his goons try kill me. Body guards Gornak kill, leave noble boy to run home.

Noble boy horses good for travel, next town sword shout about stolen horse. Town garrison fight me. Kill garrison leader and leave town. Reward for head is higher now. Chased by small army of some kingdom. Gornak ambushed them, sword make for great distraction. Leave him in middle of road for knight warriors to find and tell them about my ambush. Elf sword think Gornak dumb but Gornak wait for knights to camp and kill all slowly.

[WP] You live in a world where murder increases your life span by 10 years.,foreverchilling,"Year 700 of The Pact: Khanbalik

Generations had come and gone, and he remained, unchanged. The Universal Ruler. Khan of Khans. The Undying One. Temujin, first of his name. The Celestial Ruler sat atop a towering throne, monument to his greatness and that of his armies, carved from the wood of a thousand forests across the land, as far as horses could run. Ebony, sandalwood, oak, and more, too many for one to count. 

The ambassador fell to his knees, hailing the one whose servants had made the Pact, dozens of generations ago. Ten years for a life taken and given to Tenggri. A cult of bloody obeisance that had spread the globe, even farther than the Undying One's purview. Once one deal had been struck, the idea caught on. His master's father had been one of the first to see the value of only a slight adaptation of their old creed. Chaak and Tenggri had been merged in their pantheon, both all-rulers. Tenggri had no need for an adaptation in their practices, the cenotes and heart-cutting served just as well as any practice of the Mongols. From it, the kings of Tikal drew their power, and their long life. 

Four powers, four kings dividing all the land that mattered. Jenghiz overran the petty monarchs of the North, sending up souls to the gods for years to his and his men's lives. Cuahtemoc crushed one people after another, extending the name and tongue of the Maya to all he met, until he met the sea to the north, east, and west, and the Mountains of the Tawantinsuyu, ruled by the Sapa Inca, to the south. And, in the great deserts of the world, from Syria to Jebal Tariq to who knows how far south in the unknown continent, the Caliph held ultimate sway. 

A life taken, a quarter-lifespan earned. Four eternal empires, separated by the vast expanse of the Central Ocean. And he had come this far, to discuss trade with the Undying One. Trade. Gold from the hills for sword-metal from the North. Anything to gain an edge over the Tawantinsuyu of the mountains, and their god-king. It might yet be the salvation of his people. His legacy hung in the balance. Tens of thousands of miles traveled, and here he was. He, Awilix, prostrate in front of the Great Khan.",khalfrodo34
[WP] Sound loses the ability to travel from any device or machine.,seahorsedivorce,"“Hello? …are you still there?” Jack grumbled impatiently. “Cut off again.” He added before turning to his companion. “Is it me or are phones getting worse?”

“You haven’t been cut off,” she sighed pointing to his phone screen. She was right. The call was still going so he put the phone back against his ear and tried again.

“Well, the line is dead or something, I can’t hear anything”

“Does it matter? You weren’t talking about anything important.” she moaned

“Actually Ampara it was important!” he snapped. “I know you are annoyed at me for spending so much time on this but what would you do if you were in my situation?” He paused for breath but not long enough for a reply. “We lost every single database we had, every single one. Next week we have a meeting with Harding and Sons. If we can’t find a solution before then the firm will be bust and I will be out of a job.”

“It’s not my fault” she retorted. Jack had begun to raise his voice but she wasn’t going to back down so easily. “I told you they were being risky with the data handover.”

“It was supposed to be an infallible procedure.” Jack reiterated. “I don’t understand how it all went so wrong.”

“Of course you don’t understand.” Ampara’s voice took on a softer, sympathetic tone. “Nobody understands anything anymore. It used to be that when you has a database it would just be a filing cabinet in the corner of the office. It would just be stored in alphabetical order and even a kid would be able to use it. Now no-one even knows where their information is stored, or for that matter how it is stored. When your company moved over to cloud storage they got rid of almost half their staff. Now they are totally reliant on a system they don’t understand and all the people who knew how to revert back to the old one are gone.” Jack didn’t respond. He simply slumped back down into the sofa. The rising anger he had felt earlier had been replaced by a subdued melancholy. He knew she was right. After a pause for reflection she continued,

“I guess when you do that, when you move totally beyond the understanding of any individual then you can’t keep track of the point when even the whole team together doesn’t understand what is going on? Meanwhile you forget how it all used to get done before. When that happens something is bound to go drastically wrong. I just hope it isn’t about to happen to all of us.” They both sat there in a deeper silence than they had felt in a long time. Eventually Ampara reached for the television remote. The news had just started and she wanted to catch the headlines. However when the screen flickered to light something struck her as wrong, very wrong. Was it the silence? No. It was the look of quiet terror on the news anchors face.

MAN: It's not too late, Jerry.

JERRY:  I know, you keep saying.  But every page I re-read, reminds me of every page rejected by the media corporations; every wasted year I spent working on a new project.  

MAN: It's not too late, Jerry.

The time wasted writing Romance, I should have been loving.  Instead, nobody laughed, nobody cried, nobody loved....

[WP] Soulmates can feel each others pain and are both affected when either takes any substances. You wake up on the day of an important interview drunk with a crippling pain in your left foot.,HeartsAndHairDye,"The alarm clock screamed suddenly, breaking the cycle of sleep that I had so cherished and bringing me into reality. I groaned and slapped around on my night table until I hit the snooze button, upsetting the glass of water and a picture frame as I did so.

I opened my eyes to let in the views of my messy bedroom, carpeted floor covered with dirty clothes and various objects. I faced a wall lit by the early morning rise of a distant sun.

""You going, baby?"" Jessica muttered behind me. 

I propped myself up on my elbows to glance over at her. The morning light silhouetted her red hair into a circlet of fire that hung around her oval face. She had gotten back at some point during the night.

""Yeah."" I responded, shaking myself from the slumbering reverie that haunted my mind.

""M'kay."" She muttered, drifting back into slumber.

I heaved myself onto my feet and applied the deodorant from the stick lying on the floor near my bed. I had a big interview today. Maybe I'd finally get to put my degree to use!

""Jess? Do you know where my slacks are?"" I asked, pulling on a clean undershirt.

""What?"" She muttered, pulling the sheets further up onto her breasts.

""My slacks. The black ones that I wear to interviews."" I found them on the floor and pulled them on.

""No."" She whispered, slurring the single vowel.

""Jess, are you drunk?"" I asked, glancing at her slumbering body with mild distaste. She had almost been sober a week! I barely felt groggy, however, and could think clearly.

""Yeah."" She yawned.

I groaned in disgust and grabbed my tie and a clean dress shirt. ""Will you at least try to clean the apartment up today?""

""I'm going out."" She said, suddenly assertive. I glanced over my shoulder and saw that she was sitting up, fully alert. ""So you can do it if you don't like how I clean.""

""Whatever."" The buttons on the shirt interlaced with the holes on the other side as my fingers weaved to and fro. ""I'm just saying, you never do anything to keep the place clean.""

""I do the dishes."" She retorted, crossing her arms under her breasts. ""The ones that you get dirty.""

""You did them once last week."" I shot back. Barely ten minutes awake and we were already fighting.

""Screw you!"" She shouted and I slammed the door behind me. Before I could take a single step away, however, my left ankle lit up in a white hot flash of pain. I screamed.

------------

The taxi dropped me off in front of the glimmering glass tower where I was supposed to interview. 

""Twenty-six dollars even."" The cab driver looked back at me and I thrust the bills towards him. 

""Have a nice day."" The reply was stale. Mine was already shot.

Somehow I managed to get out of the car. I leaned heavily on the cane that my landlord had lent me as I stepped out onto the sidewalk. There was so much tylenol in my system that I could barely think.

Checking over my briefcase, I made sure that I had my resume, a cover letter and a couple of letters of reference. *Damn it.* No resume. 

I considered briefly calling Jessica to bring one out, but I shortly realized that this would accomplish nothing. Even if she had sobered up, she wouldn't get off the couch until her friends came to get her.
 
*Great.* I went into the building anyways.

-------------

""Mister Kelly?"" The receptionist called to me after placing her thumb on a headset microphone. ""They're ready for you.""

Grinning at her, I rose from my chair and approached the desk. ""Just down the hall, right?"" My head swam with tylenol thoughts as I moved.

""Yes, sir."" She said, and I moved to the left of the desk. 

""Other way, sir."" She said with a pitiful smile, and I gave her a thumbs up.

""Thanks!"" I called out.

""Good luck!"" She replied.

I swayed down the well-lit hallway, careful to avoid putting pressure on my bad foot. I found the room number and knocked before going inside. ""Is this the interview room? For the chemist job?""

""Yeah."" Replied an older man sitting at the table. ""You are Lukas Kelly, I assume.""

""Yup!"" I responded and shook his hand as he stood. 

""My name is Martin Goodwin and this is Emma Reyes."" He gestured at a cute brunette sitting in the chair beside him. She had her head down on the table, blocking out the world with arms folded around her face. She raised a single arm and waved. 

""Sorry."" She muttered as she lifted her head off of the table. ""I sprained my ankle this morning and then my head started-"" Her eyes locked on mine and she froze. 

Instantly, my heart leapt into my throat and I stared into those coffee-colored eyes as the world around her faded into grayscale.

[WP] Soulmates can feel each others pain and are both affected when either takes any substances. You wake up on the day of an important interview drunk with a crippling pain in your left foot.,HeartsAndHairDye,"I woke up drunk, again. The room spun and it took me several attempts to silence my alarm clock.

“No,” I moaned. “You bastard, not today.”

Rolling out of bed, I shrieked and fell onto the floor. My foot felt like someone had tried to chop it off with a sledgehammer. I crawled to the bathroom and dragged myself up the sink, all my weight on my good foot, until I could reach the mirror. One look in it showed me my eyes were unsteady and bloodshot. Wonderful. I had the most important interview of my life in a few hours and I was going to stumble in there looking like a deranged hobo.

I opened the medicine cabinet and grabbed the ibuprofen, knocking over several other bottles in the process. They clattered when they hit the bowl of the sink. I ignored them, turned the faucet on, and swallowed six ibuprofen tablets.

Coffee was the next order of business, and I made it to the kitchen, hopping and swearing all the way. Between the coffee and the pills my stomach lining was going to take a hit. I hoped the box of Alka-Seltzer hadn’t fallen into the sink.

While the coffee brewed I turned the oven on and threw in a frozen pizza. I needed grease and carbohydrates. 

The smell of coffee began to permeate the air and soon I was guzzling a big mug of the stuff, heavily doctored with milk and sugar. I hated coffee, almost as much as I hated my soulmate. Whoever he was.

When the pizza was done I ate so fast I burned the roof of my mouth. It was that kind of day. A least I’d be sharing that burn with my awful soulmate.

To my dismay, after an awkward shower, I actually felt worse. The hangover was starting. There was nothing for it, I was going to have to seek professional help. It was expensive and humiliating, but I had no choice. At least I had the number for SOBER-U-UP on speed dial.

“Hi, this is Lacey Whit--”

“LACEY,” the voice on the other end of the line boomed joyfully. I winced. “My girl! How are you?”

“It’s really bad today, Joe,” I said. “Can you come out?”

“The usual?” He chuckled.

“He’s also done something to his foot. Feels like he crushed his heel or something.”

“It’s an extra hundred bucks for that. You sure you can’t wait it out?”

“I have an interview today, at VisionCast. It’s my dream job, I can’t miss it.”

“That’s great news!” he shouted. I winced again. “Don’t worry, I’ll be out in a jiff.”

“Thanks, Joe.”

True to his word, it was only fifteen minutes before Joe arrived to pound at the door. I let him in, finding the sight of the big, gray-bearded man both reassuring and humiliating. He helped me to a chair and opened his kit on the kitchen table.

Already familiar with this process, I held out my arm. Joe was a professional with the IV, despite looking like he should be wearing coveralls on a farm out west, and I hardly felt a thing. 

“Let’s see the foot,” he said. My toenail polish was chipping, but I didn’t hesitate to place my foot in his calloused hands. 

“The heel,” I said. He pulled a stainless steel cylinder out of his kit. The pain I was already feeling covered the pinpricks of the auto-injector, but I heard the hissing.

“So he’s at it again, huh?” Joe said, releasing my foot. 

I crossed my legs and to my dismay I felt tears well up in my eyes. “I hate this.”

“Still no idea who he is, then?”

I shrugged. “I have to have met him, or this linking garbage wouldn’t be happening. But I don’t know.”

“Maybe you met him when you were kids, and he moved away.”

“Maybe,” I said. My voice rose. “I don’t care. The guy is a drunk. I don’t want anything to do with him.” I scrubbed at my eyes. “The worst part is nobody seems to get it. My mom and sister think my life is some kind of romantic movie. They’re always talking about hiring a company to find him, and he’ll take one look at me and his love for me will fix everything. It’s crazy. 

""He drinks all the time, it’s Tuesday for God’s sake. I’ve lost jobs because of that loser! I can’t even have a glass of wine, it makes him go nuts and we both black out! The guy knows I’m out there and he doesn’t give a shit about me. Do they think my life would be better if I loved him? It would just be even more horrible than it already is.”

Joe didn’t respond, just sat there turning the injector over and over in his hands, looking at the floor. I sniffled, and noticed my foot didn’t hurt anymore. I was also feeling less woozy. At least I would get to my interview on time and in good shape. 

“You remind me of my daughter,” Joe said eventually. “She was a good kid, a real try-hard. And smart!” He laughed. “My sons are like me, but our daughter wasn’t like either of us. She was something else.” 

“Well, we lost her,” he said. 

I opened my mouth, but he shushed me. “It was a long time ago, it doesn’t hurt so bad now. They never did anything to the guy who killed her. He got off on some technicality. But we knew.”

“Anyway, I know a guy. Old friend, grew up together sort of thing. You think I’m a bit rough, you should see him.” He laughed. “He took care of it.” Joe shot me a look. “Don’t tell my wife, she doesn’t know. Wouldn’t approve. But I sleep at night just fine.”

I stared at him, not sure why he was telling me this.

“What I’m saying is, if you wanted, this guy could take care of it for you.”

Hope and guilt flared inside me. “Would it hurt him?” I asked.

“Nah,” he said. “He’d find him, first. Most likely he’d put you out with something then. You wouldn’t feel anything and your drunk would be out, too. You’d be safe if something happened to him, just like your foot isn’t really hurt.”

“I see,” I whispered.

“Well,” he said briskly, and stood up. “You’re all set. I’d better be going. I’ll just put this on your account and you can get to it whenever you want. I know you’re good for it.”

He packed up his things and gave me a nod at the door. “If there’s anything else I can do for you, just let me know. Call anytime.”

“Thanks,” I said. 

Alone again, I let out a shaky breath.

*****

My interview was a smashing success. Ms. Becker and I clicked immediately, and I knew I had this job the way I knew the sun would rise in the east. I wanted to skip home, but it wasn’t really practical to do so in heels. 

I stopped at the grocery store on the way, thinking of getting something nice to celebrate. I walked past the liquor aisle, wishing I could buy a bottle of champagne, and knowing that if I did I would pay dearly for it. Chocolate ice cream didn’t sound too bad.

I thought about the time my boyfriend broke up with me because I was always too sick to go anywhere on weekends. I thought about the all the times I was stranded someplace and had to call a cab because I was suddenly too drunk to drive. I thought about the two jobs I was fired from because of attendance issues. I thought about all the pain I endured when he got in fights. I didn’t get the bruises, but it hurt just the same.

I retraced my steps, marching down the liquor aisle and grabbing a bottle of pink moscato. I’d eat chocolate tonight, but I was going to need something for a special occasion.

I hurried to the checkout lanes, wanting to get home. I had a phone call to make.

[WP] Soulmates can feel each others pain and are both affected when either takes any substances. You wake up on the day of an important interview drunk with a crippling pain in your left foot.,HeartsAndHairDye,"Soulmates. Twin flames, separated from a single soul source that used to be one. The Gods saw this one super soul to be too dangerous and split them all in half. That's why if something happens to one half of that soul, even if you've never met them and possibly never will, you will still feel an echo of what happens to them. You won't break a bone or lose a limb if they do, but you'll feel it and even though you still have your arm, it will feel like it's not there at times. I didn't believe it either, but it happened to my fiend Kay. She still goes through physical therapy to teach herself to keep using that arm.

Despite all the ill side effects that can come from a soul mate, most people still want to know who their other half is. I wish I could find my soul mate, just like everyone else. Mostly, though, I want to find him to tell him to stop drinking so damn much, especially on nights before I have a big interview.

My current predicament was uncurling myself from the fetal position at the bottom of my shower stall so I could rinse the shampoo from my hair before my ten minute warning alarm went off saying I had to leave for my interview. I was waiting for the pain in both my head and my left foot to subside, praying that the Advil kicked in soon. Drunken headaches I was used to, but I had idea what he did to his foot to make it hurt so much, but I suspected his was broken.

I really needed to nail this interview. It had been almost two months since I had lost my job in the city and had been forced to bunk on a friend's couch in the suburbs to save money. I needed to find a job and get back to my old place; I currently had a trust fund party boy subletting it and I was dreading what he was doing to my furniture and glassware. Ginny said it was all she could find for me last minute, and had vouched for him, but it still made me nervous that I had someone I had never met living in my home.

When the pain lessened a little I crawled into the cool spray of the shower and lifted one shaky hand to rinse my hair of any stray shampoo suds before turning the shower off and crawling out of the stall. I just wanted to crawl back into my bed and insert an IV drip into my arm even though it wasn't my body that was dehydrated. That was the one thing that really sucked about not knowing who my soul mate was, because ultimately I wouldn't feel better until he did.

I just wanted to shake him and ask him why he did these things to us. Instead I dressed in the clothes I had set out for myself the night before and rested my head against the cool side of the bathroom counter as I combed and braided my hair by feel alone. Then came the hard part. I braced myself for the pain I knew would come and levered myself onto my feet, being extra cautious to not put too much pressure on my left side. I realized the pills were working when the pain didn’t immediately make me feel nauseous as it had this morning when I had unthinkingly put my full weight onto that foot.

Now it was a dull ache and when I experimentally put weight on it, I found I could walk, though it was more of a limp than any sort of natural gait. But I would take it, I could do no less. Looking at myself in the mirror I frowned, hoping the sickly paleness in my face would fade by the time I got into the city, as there was no way I had time to put on make-up. I threw the make-up bag into my purse just in case and jammed my favorite sun glasses onto my face before slowly making my way out of my friend’s apartment. 

By the time I painstakingly walked the four blocks to the train station and nearly missing my train because it had taken me so long to get there, I sat down in a row by myself and stretched out my “injured” leg across the seat. I vowed that if I made it through this day I was going to make a real effort to figure out who this mystery man was, because he needed a serious intervention, and I was the perfect person to deliver it.

[WP] Write a generic fantasy tale... But instead of knights in shining armor the era is trench warfare.,I_hate_bean_soup,"Lord Maxwell Seigneurson O'Seigneur looked out over the trenches. This was no place to be left with only one pint of moustache wax. Still, needs were needs and his helmet pinged as another stone bounced off, no doubt launched towards him by the impact of some artillery or magic.

This really was no place for someone trying to rescue the prince's fiancée, but Elizabeth really was in trouble. Elizabeth Angela Marguerite Bowes-Lyon was being held by Zee Germans, and Albert Frederick Arthur George had asked all of the nobles to get her back.

They had told the peasantry that it was something something a serb and austrians and that chappie Franz.

No, for the pride of the British Empire, war had been declared. Now, Lord Max, as he liked to be called, was a colonel and frankly, he didn't like it. This hunching down in the mud wasn't for him. Then again, given what the trenches protected him from, he didn't mind it too much. Excusing himself from his bunker, he sent a runner for the head of his artillery corps. There was some bickering about who it was, and both turned up. Sir Greybeard, a rank 15 evoker and head of the magical division turned up with Captain Ryes, an artillery man who could drop a 18 pounder shell on a penny.

""Right, men."" Lord Max drew himself up as he tended to do when being serious. ""We have to kill the dragon."" Now, I know you don't like each other, but those damned huns have our infantry pinned down with that bally lizard. I know it's a bother, but it's not even mature, and if it gets aloft, we're done for. So give me options.""

The two men started to speak, and then looked at each other and paused, then again, tried to intterupt each other. Lord Max stroked his moustache, a massive set of liphairs that was waxed to over a foot wide on either side. Interrupting his artillerymen, Max started to outline the new plan.

----

The next day, one man in shining armour climbed over the trench top. Thankfully, the armour was good against the absolute hail of Mauser rounds that pinged off the enchanted steel.

Waving the flag bearing the coat of arms of Lord Maxwell Seigneurson O'Seigneur the armoured figure strode to the middle of no mans land, and started yelling, in bad German about how the only thing stopping him from going and driving off all the huns himself was their silly lizard, and if it showed its face, he'd cut it in half with his ancestral claymore.

It was that ironic moment the magical young dragon appeared from under it's invisibility and ate the man in one swift motion.

Back in the trenches Lord Max noted the death of the private, and blew his whistle. Every wizard and rifle, every machine gun and sorcerer, ever artillery and witch let everything they had go at the predetermined location.

It was chaos.

Lord Max had even called in some favours to get some Naval Artillery placed on some railway carriages and placed under his command. With Fire and 18 Pounders, with Ice Spears and .30-03, with angelic blasts and 12"" naval shells, the dragon screamed, writhed, and died.

Greybeard and Ryes turned to Max, proclaiming ""That was a golly good show"" ""Well done old boy""&gt; Max just waved his hand ""We have slain the dragon, but now, we must deal with the soliders! Men! Prepare to go over the top on the whistle!""

Private Astra.  This is my story of heroism, to save the girl from the clutches of the enemy. Perhaps, I should  have started it out like this. Once upon a time  in a land much different then our own, a fair maiden, with hair deep auburn tied in a tight bun, served our fair country and lived amongst ogres and brutes. Clara Jacey the head nurse of our section, a queens regal appearance paled her ability to command and coordinate  with such a soft voice.  We had enjoyed the gruel the kitchen elves passed of as edible together a few times before... Then at the dead of night the no man's land lit up as lead fire opened up. A group of enemy raiders dropped into our trenches and we faught to the death. I laid in the nurses tent after taking a few rounds in the shoulder.  That's when they took her, shouting that their  general needed emergency medical attention. I pulled myself together and took to the shadows  to stalk them back to their base.  My only spell incapacitated most of the enemies after I pulled the pin. The aftermath was cleaned up by Excalibur  my smg. I found her again working miracles for the enemy. In the general's  tent I planted two lead in his skull and saved my princess.  We crossed back to our meager kingdom. Happily ever .... the war still rages. After, is when we all go home.

[WP] Write a generic fantasy tale... But instead of knights in shining armor the era is trench warfare.,I_hate_bean_soup,"The rats ate well on the corpses. 

Boots plunged into the sucking mud, the knee high muck clinging to their legs as they marched down the communication trench to the front. Wooden duckboards could barely be felt underneath their hobnail boots, their existence the only reason they could make any effort through the mire. Weathered sandbags and bits of rusted barbed wire poked out from the sides of the trenches, an errant hand or leg sticking out from the wall proof of a half-buried body. The overcast sky was a deathly grey, the sun never seen from murky dawn to pale dusk. Overhead dragons whirled and spun, their riders urging their beasts higher and faster to gain an advantage against their opposite numbers. Every now and then two beasts would impact, claws and teeth shredding at one another in desperate fury. A shower of blood rained down upon the heads of those directly under the aerial battle, the dark, hot blood of dragons soaking their tunics and splashing against their helmets. 

As they moved towards the front, those they were relieving trudged in the opposite direction and towards the promise of hot showers and clean beds. They looked more like walking corpses than Elves, their faces sunken with hunger and exhaustion, their eyes ringed with bleary red. Tired jokes and words of warning passed between the two groups, neither with the strength or energy to cheer the other up. The walls of the trenches took on a new hue, the soil stained a sickly yellow, the dead bodies falling from their graves blue with unnatural disease. 

At the checkpoint where the communication trench met the front lines a gruesome message had been left, a worn sign board with a Elvish skull impaled on a spike.

***""He didn't keep his mask handy...""***

An itinerant preacher, one of the few mad or fervent enough to risk coming this close to the front made a sign of blessing over each and every soldiers, his words of a mixture of Ancient Fae and modern Elvish. 

""*Elliteu Patri Geatesia...* May the Gods watch over their divine soldiers. *Hethalin portu nililitana boii...*""

The soldiers shuffled past, their eyes cast down at their mud hidden feet. Every Elf who made it past this point had a one in three chance of never coming back a whole Fae. Whether dead or maimed, a third of them would only be leaving on a stretcher if they even left at all.

"[WP] ""Dogs"" exist within the Pokemon universe but are not called that. A late young trainer is given a Puppy by Professor Oak when the 3 starter Pokemon have already been chosen.",Microthrowaway64,"It was almost time! Ash had been glued to his window since morning, watching people mingle in front of Oak's lab, snapping pictures of his three neighbors with their new Pokemon. He glanced at the clock--4:57--and back out the window, and back at the clock again. 5:00, Gary had told him. He wondered what the surprise would be. 

Ash picked at his jacket. Outside, Gary posed for a picture with a couple of girls. He liked Gary. Gary was always happy whenever he was around him, smiling and pointing and laughing. He was leaving today, which made Ash sad. But Gary had promised him something special.

4:59. Ash watched as the minute hand creep to six. As soon as it did, he leapt to his feet and raced down the stairs, his red cap almost bouncing off his head. He stumbled out the door and sprinted all the way to the lab. The crowds had begun to disperse, but he still had to navigate through a few clumps of stragglers. As he elbowed past, he heard some shouts, some laughs, some cheers. Ash spun around and flashed them a smile before pushing the double doors of the lab open. 5:00 sharp.

Oak was nowhere to be seen. In fact, nobody was there, except for two people. One was Gary, and the other was an older boy, probably in his teens, wearing an unbuttoned lab coat over a black tank top. Probably one of Oak's interns. He leaned against a beaker-filled shelf column that tilted precariously, chatting with Gary. 

Gary turned to look at Ash. His lips pursed into a grin. ""Hey, bud. You ready for your surprise?"" Ash nodded. He couldn't help but smile back. The other boy picked up a small box from behind a pile, wrapped in newspaper and adorned with a bow. He set it in front of ash. ""Go on. Open it.""

The box shook. Trembling, Ash tore the paper off and pried open the lid. Inside was...

""Oh, wow!"" Gary exclaimed. ""It's a Pikachu! It's an Electric-type and one of the rarest Pokemon of all!"" Pikachu greeted his new owner with a lick on the nose.

Ash sat there, staring at the creature in the box. A pink leash was wrapped around its neck. ""This...this is for me?"" He looked around.

""Yeah, I know we tend to only have three new trainers per year. But I pulled some strings. Just for you, bud."" Ash felt his eyes water. He had never dreamed he would actually become a Pokemon trainer. ""Thank you...thanks Gary!"" Pikachu jumped out the box, into Ash's arms, almost knocking him over.

""Oh man, it already knows Tackle!"" Gary and his friend laughed. ""Well, come on. Let's see what this thing's made of."" He placed a hand on Ash's shoulder, clutching Pikachu's leash with his other, and led the two outside. The intern followed suit. Everyone had left by now: storm clouds were gathering in the sky. They passed only a few kids on their way to the outskirts of town, who giggled and whispered to themselves.

As the group entered the tall grass, Ash noticed the red and white balls on Gary's belt. ""So, uh...Gary? Aren't I supposed to have...have, uh, those balls for Pikachu?"" Gary turned to him.

""Yeah, we know you don't have balls."" Gary and the interned snickered. ""I mean, no. You're supposed to train your Pikachu before it will allow you to keep it in a Pokeball. Like this.""

In one quick motion, Gary snatched Ash's hat and began sprinting towards the tree up ahead. Ash shouted at him and took off in pursuit, Pikachu at his heels. Gary was always doing stuff like this, messing with his hat, taking it away from him. He liked him, but he wished he would stop doing that stuff.

Gary reached the tree and tossed Ash's cap upwards, where it hooked itself onto a branch. Ash could barely see it because it had gotten so dark. He stopped, gasping for breath and choking back tears. ""Gary...please. How am I supposed to get it back?"" He got dizzy just at the thought of climbing the tree.

""This is your training man. Go on. Tell Pikachu to get it."" Ash looked down at Pikachu,  who stared back at him innocently, paying no heed to his command. He didn't see how Pikachu could climb the tree, anyway. Its paws were too flat. Ash explained this to Gary, who laughed. ""Come on, dude. If you want to be a real trainer, you can't make lame excuses like that.""

Light rain began to fall. Pikachu whined in discomfort. As Gary turned to talk to the intern, Ash decided he would have to retrieve his cap himself. He had never climbed a tree before, but if he couldn't climb a tree, then how could he expect to be a Pokemon trainer?

As he dug his right foot into the bark, Pikachu began to yelp at him. Gary and the intern stopped talking, and Ash heard the beep of a cellphone recorder. As he began his climb, Pikachu began to bark at him with increasing frequency, but it was drowned out by a low rumbling from the sky.

Squinting through the leaves and the rain, Ash saw his cap nestled on the second-lowest branch. He body ached as he reached out to grab it. His arms were too short. Just a little further. He clambered further onto the branch, exiting the partial of the cover of the leaves. The rain mercilessly pelted his back, soaking his denim jacket.

A sudden flash of light. Ash swore he felt the electricity whistle next to his ear. Pikachu barked. Panicking, Ash slipped from the branch and fell, hurtling face first into the green. A crack, and then pain. As blackness enveloped him, he felt Pikachu's frantic, wet tongue caressing his cheek.

"[WP] ""Dogs"" exist within the Pokemon universe but are not called that. A late young trainer is given a Puppy by Professor Oak when the 3 starter Pokemon have already been chosen.",Microthrowaway64,"Professor Oak was just finishing up in his lab when he saw a small figure outside half-stumbling through the pouring rain. As the figure came clearer, he winced at the sight of a child covered in mud and bruises. ""Fuck, he looks like he went ten rounds with a well-bred Machop..."" he thought before suddenly realizing the source of his new visitor's desperation. 

Professor Oak had already given away all three of his starter pokemon earlier in the day and panic set in as he struggled with what to tell the unfortunate latecomer. Before he could act however, the door burst open and the kid gasped, ""I'm here professor!!! Sorry I'm late... I tried to take a shortcut into Pallet Town through the Emerald hills but the trails were slippery and I fell all the way down the valley. I lost my bike but I ran as fast as I could.""

Even the wizened professor could scarcely believe what he just heard. Fifteen kilometers stood between Emerald hills and the next closest town and even veteran hikers would not have dared taking a direct route through them in this kind of downpour.

The whole situation was already pitiful but the searching gaze in the child's eyes rendered it all the more unbearable. A dangerous thought crossed the professor's mind however. Oak realized the only other specimen he could give was a recently discovered canine-type, one so novel that the global research community hadn't even agreed on an official name. As a preeminent pokemon researcher, Oak had been granted the coveted right to possess and research one of just ten known subjects. His was still very much in the adolescent stage but Oak had already made up his mind to give it to his beleagured guest... besides he was too damn exhausted to handle a juvenile breakdown.

""That was very reckless of you but I can't say that I'm not impressed"", Oak said as he handled the pokeball. He elaborated that while the original three pokemon had been given away earlier, this new and unknown specimen would be the boy's very own. ""There are only ten in the entire world that we know of and I'm entrusting you with this one... I'm not entirely sure what to make of it myself but I can tell you it appears to be a canine pokemon, quite similar to a Growlith. You know what that is right? You seem like a sharp lad."" Oak gently spoke. 

""Yes sir, I sure do. Thank you so much and I promise I'll take good care of it"" chirped the boy. His enthusiasm seemed unquenchable and Oak couldn't stifle a sympathetic grin. ""Well I have to close the lab now but you should start heading back before night fall."" The professor's face was etched more with annoyance than concern but the child assured him that he would spend the night with his aunt who lived a few blocks away.

The boy hadn't been short of gratitude as he left and now Oak finally had time to reflect. As he wearily fumbled for his pipe, he couldn't help but wonder how his colleagues would react... no less the world. His temples throbbed at the potential consequences of his actions. ""I could get indicted for public endangerment... what did those damn legal papers say... I should've bothered to read them before I signed"", he thought grimly.

His worries seemed to fade with every puff however and the unrelenting storm demured into a light drizzle. Oak took a deep breath; the lingering scent of tobacco gave way to the damp forest musk. ""Ah, I'll worry about it later"" Oak resigned. Besides, he couldn't have got to where he was without taking crazy risks from time to time. Still, the cynical professor couldn't help shaking off the tingling premonition that he'd initiated something beyond what he could ever imagine. Then again, perhaps he'd just smoked too much... it was late however and he was too tired to care.",Azureus7

She stood there, paralyzed, glaring at me. Her hair was shorter than I remembered.

I tried to move, but my muscles didn't react. My light shield and sword weren't there anymore. I was paralyzed too.

Out of the corner of my eyes, I could see Dad. He had one arm raised towards each of us, a bag of groceries on the floor. He had lost more hair since the last time, and I didn't remember those deep, long wrinkles in his forehead being there.

""Is it enough?"" he said, ""or do I have to treat you like children again?""

Both me and my sister blinked one time. We knew the drill. My father nodded, and lowered his arms. I felt my body slowly return to my own control. I turned to face him, while my sister went upstairs, her hands clenched into fists.

My dad looked at me, his expression solemn, unflinching. I could understand why everyone in the world was afraid of him. Of *Patriarch.*

""You are back,"" he said, matter-of-factly, bending down to pick up the bag of groceries.

I nodded.

""Good.""

He walked towards the kitchen. Mom was sitting on a chair, tears in her eyes.

I had to ask. I had to know.

""Dad,"" I said. ""Why didn't you stop me?""

He turned to look at me, one eyebrow raised.

""With your power. You knew I was leaving, right? You could have stopped me. Like you do with... with your puppets.""

He sighed. A deep, tired sigh. I saw him now as what he really was. Not the dangerous, all powerful supervillain. But a 58 years old man, father of two, tired of fighting, hurt by his own son.

""You are not a puppet,"" he said. ""You had to make your own decision. Have you?""

I looked at him, at Mom. *Had I?* I had been working my ass for years, trying to be not only a superhero, but a great one. One that kids would look up to. One they would want to have posters of in their room. But at the same time, I felt hollow, frustrated. There was something I missed. Having my sister by my side, fighting back to back...

""I don't know,"" I said, at last, my voice almost a whimper.

He nodded. If it had hurt him, he didn't show it.

""Well. We were planning on robbing a bank in a couple of days. A *family* job, you know,"" he stressed the word in that subtle way of his. ""If you want to join us...""

Should I? I was *Sunshear*, a superhero of the Defense Alliance. What would happen if people recognized me robbing a bank?

But why was I here, then? What had I expected? Wasn't this what I had been looking for? Wasn't this the reason I was back? To build some kind of connection to my family.

""Ok,"" I said. ""But I'll have to use a different costume.""

I paused in the doorway, the bag with my clothes still hanging from my left hand. The kitchen was just like I remembered it: a central table for six, dark wood furniture, white floors... Mom was standing next to the counter, arms crossed and looking at me with an indecipherable expression in her face. Plates full of rice, chicken, lettuce and other ingredients danced in the air, along with spoons, forks and knives.

""Mom... I..."" I paused, not sure where to go from them. *I am sorry?*, *I shouldn't have ran away?*, *I should have called?*

We stood like that for a few seconds, neither of us knowing how to break the uncomfortable silence. At last, her expression relaxed and she took a step towards me, opening her arms.

""It's ok, David,"" she said. ""It's ok.""

It wasn't. I knew it was a lie, but it wouldn't hurt to go along with it. I hugged her. A short, almost formal hug. I was the first one to pull away.

""I thought you would be at Chicago,"" she commented. *With your friends of the Defense Alliance,* she implied, but left it unsaid.

""I was. But everyone went back home for Thanksgiving,"" I replied. Another lie. Feathergirl would still be at the headquarters, just like Bluebird. I could have stayed with them. They had even invited me to dinner, but I had refused.

""How long are you staying? Are you going back to them?""

I shrugged. ""I don't know yet... I have some unused vacation days... so I can stay some time around here, if you...""

She nodded. ""Well, it's good to have you back, *Sunshine.*""

I cringed. ""It's *Sunshear*, Mom.""

""I still don't understand why you had to change your name. What was wrong about...""

I sighed. ""Again? Can't we just drop the name thing this time?""

She raised her hands. ""You are right, you are right... we can talk about that later."" She turned to glance at a passing bowl of sauce, then added some salt to it. ""Why don't you go upstairs and leave the bag in your room?"" she said. ""You can have Michael to help you.""

I turned around. A man in his sixties -Michael?- was waiting patiently next to the stairs with a lost gaze, his face expressionless.

""Dad has a new puppet?"" I asked.

Mom looked at me, alarmed. ""If you are thinking of freeing him...""

I shook my head. ""No, no. It's good,"" I said. I threw the bag at the man, who staggered when catching it. I started walking upstairs, Michael following me. 

I had tried to free one of Dad's puppets before, back when I was a teenager. Sheila, had been her name. Turns out Dad's control caused some strong withdrawal symptoms.

It hadn't gone well.

I paused before the door to my room, sighed, and opened it.

It looked... smaller than I remembered it. My bed still had the same dark blue cover. There were a couple of cardboard boxes in the corner, which I guessed contained the stuff that had been on the now empty shelves. My posters still covered the walls: the banner of the Defense Alliance. A picture of Green Ray. An illustration of the Young London Guard, the teenage superheroes posing over in front of a detained villain.

I looked at the largest of them, the picture of Windmaker that covered the front of my closet. The hero was wearing his signature costume, watching over New York City. He looked strong and trustworthy, the kind of look you'd expect a hero to have.

I had met Windmaker once, when he visited Chicago to address the new crop of heroes. I tried to picture him frustrated over the paperwork, like I had been last week. I tried to imagine him wanting to punch a guy in the subway, like I had, just because he had been listening to obnoxious music on his phone's speaker.

I couldn't. Some people had been born to be superheroes, I guessed. Others like me... well...

I threw my coat on the bed, then told Michael to leave the bag in the corner next to it. I turned to walk back downstairs.

I had tried, really tried. I had wanted to be a superhero, just like Windmaker. I had moved to Chicago and joined the Alliance. I had trained with the likes of Ironface and Doleye. I had taken down villains and helped saved people. I still thought Bluebird, Feathergirl and me made a good team, our powers complementing each other.

But there was something missing. The thrill of the first days had vanished over time... and now... I sighed. I just felt empty inside.

My right shoulder erupted in flames and pain.

Instincts kicked in, and my power formed a thick membrane of coalesced, solid light over my body, to protect me from the brunt of the explosion. Still, it had caught me off guard. I crashed into the wall, then rolled down the stairs, my whole right side in pain.

I grunted as I jumped back on my feet, looking around to search for the menace. I paused.

There was someone by the front door. I saw the silhouette of a young woman, bathed in fire. The flames formed long, thin tentacles that emerged from her back and danced slowly in the air, pointed at me. Ready to strike me again.

I recognized the silhouette from a hundred newspaper covers, TV reports, and online videos. She was one of the most infamous villains of my generation, a powerful master pyrokinetic with almost no regard for human life.

Firewitch. My sister.

""Wait, I..."" I started, raising my hand, but she didn't let me finish. A tentacle of fire surged towards me, straight at my face. I spawned a shield of light in front of me, and the tentacle crashed into it, exploding into more flames and a rain of sparks. The sheer force of the impact made me take a step back. I heard Mom scream something, but I couldn't parse the words before another flaming snake hit the shield, pushing me back to the floor.

""Lucy!"" I screamed. ""Stop it!""

""You don't get to call me Lucy!"" her voice was distorted, coming both from her mouth as from the strings of flames surrounding her body.

A tentacle of fire wrapped around my leg, making its way upwards. The protective shielding around my body prevented it from burning me, but I could still feel the heat, the pain...

A sword of clear bright light materialized in my right hand. The sword wasn't heavy, yet I knew it was as solid as it could get. I cut my sister's fire tentacle with a single swing, the flames around my leg dissipating in mid air. I tried to find my footing back, but Firewitch was unrelenting, throwing ball after ball of fire at me. I dodged one, blocked another with a well placed shield that disintegrated after taking the hit.

""Stop it!""

""You left!"" she cried, her voice hoarse.

""Please Lucy!""

A ball of fire crashed into my body. I clenched my jaw as I felt the pain and the heat.

""Fine!"" I shouted. I spawned a long, thin spear of light in my free hand, and threw it at her even before it had fully formed. She saw it coming and dodged it easily to the side, but the interruption of her onslaught gave me the time I needed to regain my footing.

Two more firey tentacles shot my way, but I was expecting them now. I blocked one with a shield I just spawned in my left arm, then cut the other with the sword, advancing to flank Firewitch.

""You left!"" A massive, cracking wall of fire emerged out of my sister and advanced towards me, the flames licking the ceiling.

When had she learnt to do *that?*

I took a step back, weighing my options. I could create a light cocoon around me. That would protect me from the wall of fire, but put me in the defensive. Maybe I should charge through it instead, using my...

""ENOUGH!""

I paused. The powerful voice didn't come from my sister, I realized, nor from Mom. It felt as if it had no point of origin, no source. As if it existed only within my head.

...within my head.

*Dad.*

A score of Elves sat kneeling before one of their number, his white hair long and unbound. He wore the simple blues and whites of the Alathir, the emblem of their clan decorating his silken robes. His court cap rested on the ground besides him, its ornate spray of feathers significant to those adept in the courtly arts. To his credit, Hilary Flint hadn't a clue.

He sat farthest from the elder courtier, one eye and one ear searching for danger or alarm. He wore robes a cut or two simpler than the courtiers, its patterns a touch less complex and the number of layers and folds fewer than what the diplomats and artisans had on. At Faith's insistence he trimmed his beard, leaving just a tuft of hair at his chin. His hair had been combed and washed. Flint forewent the Fae's usual topknot for a Suebian knot, his hair twisted in a figure-eight on the right side of his head. He had been denied access to his rifle, the heirloom considered unsuitable for the occasions and been placed in the keeping of his host's servants. They allowed him his sword though, as his role was to be bodyguard to one of their own. 

""As with everything in this life, appearances are deceiving,"" the aged poet said. ""What is one thing is in fact another, and what we believe is false is but the truth hidden in layers of doubt.""

Flint suppressed a snort and leaned to whisper in Faith's ear.

""This guy's so full of it his eyes are brown.""  

Faith hid an annoyed smile of her own.

""Hush, Flint. This is hardly the time for a quip.""

Fortunately no one had heard them, focused as they were on the poet. 

""Can anyone here tell,"" he said. ""The difference between a poet and a warrior?""

The scene was quiet as everyone digested the question. The stream that ran besides their garden party gently gurgled as songbirds sung high in the trees overhead. 

""Is it because the poet creates, and the warrior destroys?"" one courtier asked. The aged Elf shook his head.

""I am afraid not, Faradel. You, our human guest,"" the poet said smiling at Flint. ""What is the difference between you and I?""

Flint almost scowled as all eyes turned in his direction.

""Everything separates you and I,"" At the guests' astonished gasps he continued. ""You write in ink, and I in blood. This sword is my quill and with it I carve a bloody tale. You write of battles and I win them. But that does not mean I do not shrink from the path of the gentle arts. The warrior who cannot master the arts of both sword and pen will be defeated by that who has. The right hand is for the sword while the left is for the book. One sharpens the body, the other the mind."" ",LovableCoward
"[WP] Blood is not found in timber, or sap in stones.",The_Eternal_Void,"The five elements are: wood, metal, stone, life, and air. From each there is an extraction method. These produce liquids (or in the case of metal, electricity) that act as conduits for their element.

"[WP] You have been abducted by aliens. However, Galactic Police has arrested your abductors and are charging them with ""sentience abuse.""",WalkingTurtleMan,"“I really don’t think you understand the situation,” I repeated The comm channel was silent. Somewhere, on a ship across the system, a Yar’gul prosecutor was preparing a question.

“*Human*, did the accused, N’tar’alin, kidnap you? We see clearly the evidence of him having towed your ship and taking you aboard his. We understand that N’Tar’alin might have tortured you, but you’re safe now.”

Damn pompous bastards. I had explained it to them several times that, no, the Yar’gul were not more advance than us. In fact, humans were a good five hundred years ahead of them in the technological development curve. However, they had just gotten faster than light drives in the last century and had discovered that they were in a corner of the galaxy where they were dominant species amongst hundreds of lesser ones, at least until I stumbled out here with a dead faster than light drive.

“Our laws are sacred to us. We made mistakes at first. As a species, we have a sacred duty to not interfere. And we see that N’Tar’alin violated that oath. Tell us your story,” the comm replied.

“For the last time: my ship’s faster than light -- which is much faster than yours -- broke down as I was passing through this sector. N’Tar’alin stumbled upon me and actually tried his damndest to veer away, but I signaled him down. After a very pleasant first contact through my very impressive universal translator -- you have nothing like this, how do you think we are communicating right now? -- I engaged in the first interstellar commerce between the Yar’guls and the Human Conglomeration when I came aboard his ship to get some spare parts which, by the way, he didn’t even know could be used in the way I needed them. No kidnapping; if anything, I am the one who held N’Tar’alin in a state of amazement.”

Silence on the other end. Finally, a response.

“Impossible, *human*. No species is greater than the Yar’gul. We deeply regret the harm that N’Tar’alin has done to you and we hope you do not think this representative of Yar’gul behavior. We find N’Tar’alin guilty of ‘sentience abuse.’ Take peace in your vengeance and accept our mercy.”

The channel went dead. I feared what the Yar’gul intergalactic police would do to poor N’Tar’alin. I sent a general transmission out to warn others to stay away from this region until the Yar’gul grew out of their sense of self-importance and I set out on my repaired drive.

"[WP] You have been abducted by aliens. However, Galactic Police has arrested your abductors and are charging them with ""sentience abuse.""",WalkingTurtleMan,"I could feel nothing. Silhouettes against the bright lights above told me that I was not alone. Moments ago, I had been sitting on my porch. Now I was... here. Where was I? In my disoriented state, I would have thought that I was in the hospital or somewhere along those lines, but something unnatural about the place tickled my mind.

These weren't people. That was it. Their shape was inhuman, their posture unnatural. My mind categorized them separately from everything I already knew of, and placed them in the uncanny valley with the nightmares. For all I knew they weren't even humanoid. I could only see them from the chest up, after all. 

Work was being done here. I could tell that, though I couldn't tell whether they were looking at me. There was no pain. There was nothing at all. I tried to pick my head up. Nothing happened. 

A taste like metal filled my mouth. The dull sound of something like a power tool reverberated in the back of my mind. 

I was slow to realize that I had been abducted. But when I did, I knew what they were. Was this how I would go out? Or would I be returned to my planet, only to be designated insane, another crazy believer? 

A different feeling broke my trance. It was a sound, like a siren off in the distance. I really was crazy apparently. There were no sounds in space...

The officer looked down at the tiny grey figures below him and chuckled. 

""What are you boys doing out here? This is a conservation system!""

One of the children, seemingly the most mature out of them, spoke up in a stutter. ""We... we wanted to see the humans.""

The officer gave a soft smile and knelt down, patting the little alien on the head. ""You know they're still a young species, right? They're actually classified as sentient, you know. Although that call is a little debatable...""

""But we just wanted to play with them, sir!""

""I don't think the human wants you to play with him, does he? He must be pretty scared right now.""

The tiny grey alien looked up at him with its huge eyes, looking guilty. ""I guess so... I'm sorry sir. It won't happen again, honest.""

~~~

Something else is in the room. Is this what they've taken me for? He's... larger. Its like he is the one in authority. These beasts are listening to that thing!

Are they going to eat me? Will I make it out alive?!

""You know I could actually arrest you for sentience abuse, but you guys seem like nice kids. Why don't you go home now and leave the humans alone. Maybe some day when you're older there will be more humans, and you can have one as a pet!""

The boys perked up a little. ""Ok sir! Thank you!""

With that settled, the officer retrieved the scared human. He carried the paralyzed life form with him into his cruiser, connected through the airlock. The grey aliens waved goodbye behind him. 

""I'll take you home, buddy.""

   ""Terran, if you would please calm down, everything will be explained."" A giant whale-like thing in a uniform blubbered at me. My first undignified thought upon seeing this weird creature was ""OH MY GOD GANTU IS REAL. If Stitch pops up outta nowhere Jerry owes me ten bucks."" Another alien, a rhino-dog hybrid cocked its head to the side. ""I know not of this 'Gantu' you are referring to, nor what a 'stitch' is beyond a knitting term on your planet, but why would an implement used to repair a Gnorgas owe you some form of currency?"" My head began to hurt and I sputtered pathetically, not sure how to reply or even speak to these beings. The whale did an equivalent of an eye-roll. ""My partner is still a bit clueless when it comes to Terran culture, so please excuse him. We are officers of the Galactic Police, sector THX1138, Cygnus Mu system. You have just been rescued from an intergalactic drug-trafficking ring suspected of abducting sentients and using them as emotional conduits."" I shook my head still not understanding. The alien sighed. ""To them, you're a Glade plug-in that produces emotion instead of artificial odor."" That I somewhat understood. What I didn't understand was how Mr. Gantu knew what a Glade Plug-in was, not to mention how I could make out what they were saying. Deciding to ask an intelligent question, I said in a slightly less hysterical tone, ""Um, pardon me but how is it I can understand you? And how do you know of...Terran culture?"" 

The rhino-dog let out a sniffling roar. ""We are wearing translating devices and so are you. As far as your culture, Ayrdez went to your planet on holiday last cycle. Said he quite enjoyed something called 'pizza', but abhorred 'sushi'."" I tried not to laugh at the ridiculousness of it all. Regaining what was left of my composure, I took a deep breath. ""So...what now? Are you going to drop me back off on Earth? I swear I won't tell anyone about this! Not even my cat and I tell that little fucker everything!"" The aliens looked at me like I was the strange one. ""On the contrary Terran, we want you tell everyone about this experience. In galactic court after a health inspection and memory restoration, that is."" I sunk back into my seat and sighed. ""God I hate Mondays. Tell me do Galactic police officers have something called doughnuts? I could really use one right now.""

"[WP]: You have a genetic modification that allows you to regenerate, causing you to never get drunk. Instead of using your power for good, you spend your free time challenging people at the bars in drinking contests… until The Department notices and decides to pay you a visit.",hellawestcoastin,"Well, hello there. There's not much to talk about me, is there? I'm just a wandering girl, with no home to stay, because it got burnt down by the Army of Justice. Just a normal thing everyone experienced, right? Right?

This mug contains a very potent extract of Blood-Orchid ichor. It's one of the strongest drinks out there, and it isn't safe to drink in large quantities. I don't care. I don't care for its deadly properties. I ignore it. It is not relevant.

I spend most of my time wandering from bar to bar, engaging in drinking contests. Drinking is my favourite thing to do. It washes away the dirt and filth and the human worms crawling on this land, replacing them with something purer.

I never lost a drinking contest. I bet all my gold, they bet all their gold, I drink 10 mugs, they pass out at 1 mug. I take their money, engage in another drinking contest. Sometimes, they insisted on drinking 2 mugs. They can resist the allure of their emotions. However, they are not completely immune. They cannot force themselves to ignore the deadly effects.

I like my gold. Actually, I don't like it that much, which is why I only carry enough to buy three mugs of the Ichor. The rest, I spend on other things. Weapons. Books. Parts to the solution.

My hometown got burnt to the ground. All of it. All by the Army of Justice. Paladins of various powers, sacrificing the lives of others to increase their adrenaline level and their ego. The solution to the problem would involve destroying them. Completely.

Each tome contains spells of the enemy's weapon. Parts to the solution. I read all of them, and tried to piece together the parts. A creature of dark like me could never use the powers of the light normally, but I am not normal. I do not care. I find a solution to the problem, and add the result to my solution to the bigger problem.

Magic is ethereal. Magic serves no allegiance. I do not care. I steal spells, dismember them, study their common factors, and piece them together. Then I use them.

Eventually, they found me. They don't know who I truly am, though. They think I am one of those 'empowered beings'. So they recruit me.

Let me think...

I could join them, then dismember them from the inside.

Or I could refuse, and try another, safer path.

I choose to join.

---

They took me away. I hope they cannot sense my true nature.

I fill myself with light.

I let the light flow within me.

I don't care what happens.

After all, I am true darkness, and true darkness has no need for true emotions.

I found myself in the capital. Nobody noticed me yet. That's good.

Well, some people noticed me, though they think I am merely an initiate. That's good.

I walked the cobbled path. I remembered to tremble, as if I was one of them and I am anticipating something.

I pretended I was a being of light, excited to be one of them.

Well, soon enough, I was inside.

The hallway's sides was packed. I saw a man in the middle. He told me this:

""Due to evading us, and not registering your name in the Book of Superheroes, and not joining us.....""

""You shall have to be imprisoned for thirty years.""

Imprisoned. Thirty years. I don't know what to say. They didn't even sense my inner darkness.

""Ah, don't worry, he's always like that. Anyway, we are asking you to join,"" said the girl who escorted me here.

I told them I would like to join. Of course I would join. It means I could demolish them from the inside.

I don't know whether it was a trap, though. Maybe if I were more powerful, I would instantly destroy everyone in this room.

""Well, anyway, your bunker is in Building E on the third floor, the exact same one as mine. I'll escort you there""

I don't know what happened. Sure, there were a lot of shiny lights everywhere, but I don't care. I'm more concerned about the plan. It must be executed perfectly. No flaws. No betraying my true intentions.

Talking about that, I should act as though I was interested in the surroundings. I would say 'woah' every so and so, and...

""Is everybody away? Yes? Good.""

[WP] You have just died and are now face to face with God. You ask him if what we know about him and the Bible is true. He says no not at all. Document the conversation.,sarahdempsey1993,"""No, not at all.""

""Not at all? What do you mean?""

""I mean the whole Bible, totally wrong. Old Testament, New Testament, Pseudepigrapha, Apocrypha,"" God ranted, his aggravation clearly expressed in wild gesticulations, ""And all the more modern interpretations that have come out of spiritual syntheses..and pipedreams..and the ravings of cult leaders and schizophrenics. All completely bonkers!"" He softened after a moment and brought a hand up to stroke his beard. ""A few of them have gotten close though,"" he mused. ""It's funny, really. Science gives me less and less places to hide, and so do the faithful, and they're both wrong."" He sighed a small chuckle and wistfully gazed out across the landscape.

All of a sudden he seemed deep in thought, and I forgotten. I hesitated to break the silence, yet as I tried to remain patient I wondered awkwardly how long it might take until a god broke their own silence. It could be forever. On the other hand, I didn't appear to have anything else to do, or anywhere else to go. Truly, this is what being dead felt like.

""So, what's your best guess then?"" God spoke in the direction he gazed before turning to look back at me. ""I'll tell you how close you get.""

My awkwardness was now compounded tenfold. ""I, er, haven't really given it much thought.""

""Well we have all the time in the world. Or out of the world. Just give it your best, that's all I ask.""

""Ok, but wait."" God raised his eyebrows indulgently, a small smile on his face. ""If everyone has always been wrong, does that mean that whatever answer I can come up with will be wrong too? Is it possible to be right?""

""Not at all. People have described me before as being ineffable. Which, as the logic follows, means that I can, in fact, be effed. It's just that no one has hit the nose yet.""

""Ok,"" I mumbled, and tried to muster some confidence. Then I had another question. ""What about when people refer to you metaphorically, does that count?""

""If we're thinking of the same thing then no. Much too vague.""

""Ok. Interesting,"" I drew myself up, to convince myself more than He. ""So, if, if everyone has always been wrong about you, that would mean that you're neither all-powerful nor not-all-powerful, and the same with your omniscience. You are not the Creator, nor do you comprise some essence of the universe, you do not represent truth or goodness, nor do you have any special covenant with man. Oh, wait, that means you did not make us in your image either. So why do I see you like that?""

""Ah, there's a trick to that but I'm not giving you any hints.""

""Oh. Ah, you mean, you did not make us, someone else did. And they made us in your image. Which would explain Jesus not being your son either.""

""Hm, you are clever. Go on.""

""No, I think I've got it.""

""My my! Slow starter but clearly not just a pretty face!""

""Well it all came together when I remembered Acts 17:25, which says: **'Nor is He served by human hands, as though He needed anything, since He Himself gives to all people life and breath and all things.'** I mean the second part is clear enough, just look at the world as it is, it's pretty miserable. But the first part would mean that you are served by us, and you do *need* something. So, taking everything else together, here's my idea.""

""Yes, I'm listening.""

""The Universe was created for you by someone else, and all of the things inside it as well. You were placed here, and left alone, which means that you are all-powerful here but that's only relative because it's your universe and whoever created it for you is actually more powerful but they're not here. Furthermore, they gave you the Earth and humanity in your image and left you alone to care for us. You don't have a covenant with us, but you are beholden to the one that put you here. My Lord, you are *doing time*!""

God's lips were pressed together in a grim expression, his eyes narrow and hooded. I hesitated to continue, but realised that really, I had nothing to lose.

""The universe is your prison. You have to take care of us, for how long I don't know. Maybe forever, as long as forever lasts here. We look and act just as you do because that makes you identify with us, you can't help but be involved with our progress. If you don't take care of us, and learn from all our faults, and reconcile yourself with whatever crime you committed or other reason why you were put here, then you'll never get out. Whatever happens to us after that, I don't know.""

I stopped then, having run out my train of thought. God, with the same expression on his face, nodded, stepped closer, and put a hand on my shoulder. He leaned forward and murmured in my ear.

""Almost.""

"[WP] You are stranded on an island, where anything you could ever want washes ashore daily.",theoneyoutrusted,"The ordeal of the Gallant was horrible, but it would meet its end in the Caribbean quickly compared to some of her crew. Sixty nine men were caught in the worst storm in centuries. They got in their suits and got a raft into the water. Just one raft for all of them. Most of them didn't make it off the ship. Of the twelve who did, only 9 made into the raft, and 6 landed on the island after 22 days at sea. Those three died from their wounds under the watch of Gary, Barry, and Jerry. They were buried at sea. 

The island was lush, large, and perfectly suited for life. Solomon, the leader of this little group, found a freshwater source. Jerry, Gary, and Barry started to work on a shelter. Shipley, that's all anyone called him, searched the island to see if anyone else had found such a sweet spot. He returns convinced they are alone. Then, there was runt of the group, George. He laid on the beach and collected coconuts and fished. He was in no hurry for anything.  

After Solomon found water, he gathered driftwood and pointed a stick and started turning. By morning, he had made a fire. The shelter was up, and the men spent the night warm and out of the wind. George had found food, and they enjoyed a healthy breakfast. It was the first time they really talked about anything since the ship went down. 

""This is a splendid breakfast, George. You'll have to teach us how to fish like you do."" Says Solomon. 

""Yes, sir, happily."" 

George teaches them to fish like the parable states and they live for a time, happily. As weeks pass, it is Gary who wishes for something first. 

""I wish I had a Chipotle burrito."" 

""Oh man, stop it."" Says Jerry. 

""My stomach grumbles enough."" Says Barry. 

The group goes to bed. The next morning, Gary walks along the beach and sees a cooler. He opens the container to see one Chipotle burrito. It is perfect, somehow still warm. He practically chokes on it. Gary is no rocket scientist, but he wishes again. It comes true, and he continues to wish and continues to hide it from the others. 

Gary couldn't hide it forever. He was gaining weight, and the rest of his crew mates were growing frail and thin. It was George who found him hoarding. Gary didn't explain. He refused to give away his gift. It wouldn't have mattered. Gary offered nothing and attacked George. George pulled his knife and defended himself. As he stabbed the life out of Gary, George heard him say: ""I wish I were immortal."" George stopped, but it was too late. Gary had passed. 

George, covered in blood, raced to the sea. He washed off what he could, then he returned to hide the body of this man who used to be his friend. George looks over his stash and is so confused about it. He has so many questions. Where did it come from? He wished he knew. He starts crying. 

""I wish I had a way to get off this island."" 

George goes back to their camp and confesses to his crime and the stash, not even claiming self defense. Solomon holds back Barry and Jerry. The crew follows George to the stash and gorge on all of the food. It is everything they could ever want and yet somehow more. The group falls asleep satisfied, except for Barry and Jerry who plot. 

The next morning George is gone, but a motorized boat has washed ashore. Solomon and Shipley look it over. It is sea-worthy. The motor even starts. Solomon and Shipley hug and cheer. Barry and Jerry look at them with less enthusiasm. They know what happened to George. There isn't much mystery sadly. As night looms, Shipley says: ""I wish we had a map, Solomon."" 

""I wish George were still alive."" 

""Sleep with one eye open my friend. Tomorrow, we leave."" Says Shipley. 

Barry and Jerry have other plans. The island cache has more weapons than they would ever need as they stab Shipley and Solomon repeatedly and leave them to die. Barry and Jerry load the boat with gold treasure and money and shove off. The motor doesn't start. They start to drift into the sea. George sits on the beach, alive again. The boat drifts and drifts, further and further away from the island. 

""I wish one hell of a storm would hit this area."" 

As the clouds gather, gale force winds slap around the boat. It capsizes. Barry and Jerry hang on for dear life. Life does not hang onto so dearly to them. George keeps wishing. 

""I wish Shipley and Solomon would survive. I wish we had a boat."" 

George finds them and nurses them back to health. He finds the map they wished for. They set off from the island for a port they'll reach soon enough. George looks back at the island and briefly remembers his death. 

""Solomon, why did you wish I were alive? Did you know?""

***TRIGGER ALERT: MURDER***


""I've never been to the beach before...""


 When Marcus woke up lying in the heat of the sun instead of the sheets on his bed, that was the first thought that came to his semi-conscious mind. It took him a full minute of looking around and rubbing his eyes in disbelief before finally realizing that he wasn't in the midst of a dream anymore. This was real, the sun was hot, and the water...the water.....

He snapped into focus. He was sitting on a beach, alone. Waves were creeping their way up the shore towards his feet. There weren't any buildings, which was odd to him. 

**""Hello!!""** he shouted to the silence of this place, wherever it was. And only silence shouted back. ***""Helloooooo! IS ANYONE THERE?""*** he called out, and again recieved no answer but the wind.

He began walking down the beach in search of any form of society. Occasionally, he'd spin in circles shouting out into the air for a response he'd never get, for help that would never come. He was still wearing the same clothes he was wearing when he blacked out: Beige short-sleeved workshirt with a patch bearing his name ironed on, and kakhi pants along with his black, non-slip work shoes. It happened just as he arrived home from work. In his life before, he had been an underpaid and mistreated janitor at a shopping mall. He'd go to work 10 hours a day, never cleaning a single mess of his own. Mopping up vomit, unclogging backed up toilets, wiping down tables of the filth left behind by oblivious patrons of the mall. 

So in his loneliness, he felt none the worse for his lost career. It was his home life that he longed for. 60 hours a week he was the invisible force that kept the mall clean and free of mess. No one thanked him or paid any attention. Nobody gave thought to throwing used napkins and wrappers on the ground instead of in trashcans. But all that changed as soon as Marcus walked in the front door of his shabby 1 bedroom apartment, and arrived home to his wife, Martha, for she was the center of his world. At home, he was special because she made him that way. It was as if all the unfairness and cruelty of his life at work melted away as soon as he laid next to her and held her in his arms.

He stopped and looked out at the ocean, feeling a wave of heartsickness and regret wave over him. The sun had begun to go down, and he was hungry. He tried to remember when he had last eaten, and the process only made his stomach turn. He closed his eyes.

""God, what I wouldn't give for...shit, even just an apple..."" Marcus muttered quietly. 

He looked up and nearly lost his breath. Right in front of him in the sand, as if placed there by God himself, was a big, shiny red apple, ripe as could be. He laughed nervously, not yet fully believing what he was seeing. He slowly reached toward the apple, sure that he was seeing things. That apple couldn't possibly really be there, yet when he grabbed it, it didn't fall. It was solid! He picked it up and, with a slight hesitation, put the apple to his mouth and took a bite. And it was delicious! He knew that this had to be the greatest apple he had ever eaten, and not just because he was alone on a strange island in the middle of the ocean.

....*but how had it gotten there?*

He swallowed and looked down at the apple in his hand. He had wished for food-no, he had specifically said ""even just an apple"", and then *viola*! An apple mysteriously washes ashore. Could it be possible? Could he have really *wished* the apple onto the beach? He decided that there was only one way to find out, and at the risk of appearing foolish to no one, he said aloud: ""I really wish I had a cigarette handy"".

He blinked and looked at the waves rolling up the beach towards him. They wrapped around his ankles, smothering his feet underneath the salt-water. Marcus began to hold his breath as the wave retreated back into the ocean, and when it did, there between his feet was an unopened pack of cowboy killers: Marlboro Red 100's. He laughed aloud, and started wishing away. 

He stayed on the beach for hours, receiving everything he wished for from the charitable waters. A lighter for his cigarettes, steak, whiskey, a mobile phone (which didn't do him any good, as there wasn't a signal for miles in any direction and the battery was dead), even an ounce of marijuana and a pipe found it's way onto the sand of this mysterious place.

Sitting under a tree and smoking his pipe, Marcus began to realize that all of these things that were happening meant nothing to him if his Martha wasn't with him. He walked back out to the beach and closed his eyes. He took a deep breath and said aloud: ""Oh Martha, I want nothing more in the whole world than to see you wash up on this beach right now"". He waited for the waves to go up and then back down again, eagerly expecting his love from underneath the water. 

He opened his eyes. The beach was empty. He looked around frantically, but alas, Martha was not there. ""

**""NO!""** he shouted at the sky. ""Why me? Why, Oh God, did you put here in on this place?"" He fell to his knees in tears.

From behind him, a small chuckle seemed to emanate from the very air itself. A gross, hollow voice said from nowhere: ""Didn't you know? God has abandoned you""

Marcus jumped straight to his feet, terrified. His eyes searched desperately to locate the source of the twisted voice that spoke to him. ""Who....Who are you? Wh-where are you?"" he stammered lightly. A mere ten feet away from him, the air shifted, growing brighter as if reality itself were being warmed by fire. A figure appeared then, tall and cloaked in and unnatural shadow. 

""I am the master of fate. Some call me the Devil, some just call me evil. I am Zuulthied, charged with carrying out your punishment in the afterlife."" The figures voice sent tendrils of terror down Marcus's every fiber of being. It was as if this...whatever it was was speaking with reality itself. 

""P-puh-punishment?"" Marcus breathed. His heart skipped a beat. ""Afterlife....?"" Comprehension smashed into him like a bus. 

""Yes, Marcus,"" the figure replied. ""You are here because you died without atoning for your wrongs against your sweet Martha.""

It all played back behind his eyes as he clenched them shut in mental agony. That day...he hadn't meant for it to happen! He had only wanted her to understand, but she wouldn't listen. All he had done was make her listen, make her *comprehend*. ""I only wanted her to listen..."" he mumbled through his tears.

He had come home after work. It had been a particularly scary day for Marcus. He had come very close to losing his job after losing his temper at his boss. But his boss was so *mean*, so *hateful*. He had simply forgotten to put a sign up where he had mopped up a spill in the food court. His boss called Marcus into his office. The boss said Marcus was a ""god damned retard"". ""How hard is it to do your fucking job, you stupid son of a bitch?"" Marcus started yelling, and the boss threatened to fire him if he didn't change his attitude, and told him to go home and not come back for a week. He claimed Marcus was to use this time to wisen up and think about how badly he needs his job. When he got home, Marcus unloaded all of his frustrations at his wife, Martha, who had grown tired of her depressing life with her depressing husband. When she told him that she was in no mood to play therapist, Marcus snapped. He grabbed up the baseball bat behind the door, walked up to Martha's back, and brought the bat down on her head. 

She cried out and collapsed to the floor. Marcus brought the bat down again, this time onto her back. **""STOP MARCUS, PLEASE, OH GOD!""** These were the last words she spoke before her life left her.

Marcus fell to his knees before the otherworldly being, sobbing in hysterical anguish. ""Come now, Marcus,"" it said smugly. ""You have everything you could ever want, right here on this shore"". It looked down at him, and though it didn't have a face, he could feel it smiling sadistically at him. ""But never shall any living thing wash up on these sands"", the Executioner continued. ""Never again shall anything, or anyone, listen or care about you or the way you feel. Such is the punishment for your crimes. **Zuulthied has spoken!""** It's closing statement was uttered with such power that it shook the very fabric of existence. Zuulthied disappeared in a flash of vibrant light and a big boom. 

Left alone, Marcus began walking the beach. He walked for days, months, years, coming soon to realize that the beach would never end, and he would never escape.

And never would anyone listen to him again.


**EDIT:** This is only my second ever submission. I hope it's a little better than my first!",srirachabound
"[WP] You are stranded on an island, where anything you could ever want washes ashore daily.",theoneyoutrusted,"The hot tropical rays of light bore down on my closed eyelids, waking me, but I didn't stir. I was tired. My muscles ached. The frightful night behind saw me survive a plane crash, and a swim (what I guess to be) over mile in length underneath a full-moon. The swim led me to find solid ground on a shallow beach that bore back a dark foreboding jungle. It was on that beach I collapsed from exhaustion from my swim. It was there I slept so hard I might have died. Waking now, I wondered If I had died. I attended to the sensation of sand in my mouth, and on my lips. I felt the hot unrelenting rays of the tropical sun on my exposed back, drying the blood from my cut and brushed flesh. It must have been mid day. I tired to move, but soon gave up after feeling the ache in my muscles and the clawing in my stomach. I heard the call to action, but I didn't feel much like moving; weariness and despair weighed me down. 

I laid there for a long time, loosely slipping across the veil of conscious. 

I was planted firmly in the waking world only when rising tide began wetten my feet. Poseidon's nudges coerced me, begrudgingly, upright. Once standing, I began to walk.

I stumbled along the beach for a time, cracking the scabs of my injuries-- reopening the wounds. I was alone and ignorant. The pristine beach and the bestial jungle was evidence enough to undoubtedly prove my isolation. There was no trash, no boats, so indications of humans at all. The flat baren beach, and the hostile twisted jungle solidified a truth I hadn't quite articulated to myself yet: I needed people. I didn't know how to survive. I'd never cared for the outdoors enough to spend anytime in them-- maybe if I had, then I would have fostered the kind of aptitude necessary for survival. The feeling of hoplessnes slowly zapped my strength.

I sat on a conveniently place piece of drift wood. While resting, I considered my situation, and felt blood flow down my leg from my established wounds. My mood worsened as I felt hunger, thirst, and my own dripping blood. I contemplated my own mortality-- I was soon to die, and I knew it. In that low moment, I felt a nudge against my toe. Looking down I saw a book titled ""*The Official Boy Scout Survival Hand-guide: Survival in the Tropics &amp; at Sea! Vol. IV*"" wrapped in a zip-lock bag. 

'*The air in the bag made the book float, and it came in the with tide.*' I thought.

I was elated! Forgetting my discomfort and pain I opened the bag, and then the book to read what it had to offer. I was light-headed so I read slow, but the book was easy to navigate, and provided many illustrations. I felt better after I fished reading. When I was done I knew I needed to find food, bandages, and fresh water, and (more importantly) how to do so. Furthermore, as might have been obvious to some, the beach offered none of those things; but the jungle might. So, I drew myself upright again, and set into the wild less afraid.

A short expedition proved bountiful. I found a vine that, when severed, produced a trickle of fresh water, some low hanging fruit , and a plant that soothed my wounds, all identified as safe and helpful by the guide. Once I was hydrated, fed, and on the mend, I made my way to the beach to look at the starry sky. Soon thereafter I found sleep.

The next morning I awoke to a banging. Adjusting the the waking world, I stood and looked for the source of the noise. A ways down the beach, I saw several plastic containers being jostled together by the tide. 

'*From the wreck, maybe?'* I ventured a guess.

Once there, I saw they were labeled with a popular sporting goods store' insignia. 

*'No, not from the plane-- at least that would be very strange if a passenger airliner had been transporting 20 crates of merchandise for a sporting goods store'* I thought.

I quickly rescued the boxes from the tide, and preceded to open them. Once open, I found all kinds of implements that would aid in my survival. The supplies ranged from dehydrated food, to knives, to clothes, to shelter-- the list went on.

Survival had suddenly become possible-- no, survival had become *easy.* 

The following days went by quickly. I had established a base camp on the edge of the jungle, where I stored all the materials I found that day. My luck, it seems was to continue, as I continued to find useful items on the beach every day. Sometimes the items were further down the beach, sometimes right outside my door. Regardless, I could always count on something being delivered with the sun. However, the items began to change as my situation on the island changed. 

Once I had built a permanent outpost, and survival became a matter of fact, I began to find things like carpet and books wash ashore. Soon I was living in some leisure. I was beginning to lead a life on this island that I never could back home. I was physical fit, I was well read, I was eating healthy, and I was more tan than I had ever been. I wasn't sure I want to leave-- the place was oddly comforting. I was lonely but I lived well. My new-found wealth, if you want to call it that, was provided entirely by things washing ashore.

However, my loneliness was soon cured. It was cured by Mica, when she washed up next to my base cape. Mica worked in HR at my old job. She was a very beautiful person-- whom I'd never gotten around to asking on a date. She washed ashore moths after the crash, after everything was established. She possessed some odd degree of amnesia. I'm beginning to believe something other than luck is behind these things that are washing ashore.

"[WP] You are stranded on an island, where anything you could ever want washes ashore daily.",theoneyoutrusted,"I sigh heavily, unable to find a relaxing position to lay down on. My body is getting stiff and hot. Unbelievably, my insomnia is even worse than before, and I don’t even have social media to blame. Is it because my pillow is just a big rock? Or is it because that rock has way too many tropical insects crawling around on it at all hours? At least it’s smoother than those other rocks. Whatever, that doesn’t matter. 

The sun is beating down on me, like how my dad used to. Punchline. I mean, how did I even get here? I was finally leaving that dump. “Home” was the dregs, and I don’t even want to explain why. I tried that with my counselors. Thinking back on it, maybe I needed an exorcist. 

Work wasn’t much different either. I never got that job that I studied years for. I was taking orders from someone who was half as productive as me, in a standard data entry position. It’s not difficult to generate charts for stats on Salesforce. I saw the numbers. Employee of the month always went to whoever was chummiest with the managers too. Not much different than most work places though, I assume.

Setting aside the every-day abuse, I guess I didn’t make things any better for myself. I felt so isolated. Making friends seemed so contrived. It’s like everyone just wants to friend up just for another notch on the Facebook friends belt, or the occasional LinkedIn endorsements. Goodbye, sayonara, arrivederci.

It’s been a few weeks since I was first stranded. All things considered, things are going well. There are enough fruits on the ground like it’s some kind of Jainist paradise. Though, it’s curious, man. Ever since a couple days ago, these rather nice polycarbonate cases started to appear on the shore. Never really seem them before in real life. I open them up, and it’s a gun collector’s dream. Vintage Russian rifles to modern, customized armaments. All in great condition and enough rounds to last a small firefight. It’s exciting in a way.

The more I think about it... maybe it’s not the guns themselves I’m excited about.

"[WP] You are stranded on an island, where anything you could ever want washes ashore daily.",theoneyoutrusted,"""I'm very sorry about this, I just wanted a friend.""

I spat out sandy water and choked on the fresh air. Without my glasses, the squat man in front of me looked like a chubby blur, but the voice was familiar.

""It gets lonely out here, you see, and I really wanted someone to talk to. I tried not to want it too hard, but... Well, here you are.""

The next wave that washed to shore deposited my glasses on my face and I sputtered anew. As the water receded, the chubby blur resolved itself into the figure of Brian, my college roommate. I hadn't seen him in years.

""Want to play some Goldeneye? The Nintendo 64 that washed up last week came with a second controller.""

I stood up and took in my surroundings. The small island was the only visible landmass around. Greenery was abundant. But something was out of place.

""Is that a gazebo?"" I asked Brian.

""Yup. No idea how that got into the ocean, but it looks just like the one out front the Quad back in the day. Remember? Oh man."" A slightly soggy looking spliff materialized in Brian's hand. He took a silver knife out of his tuxedo jacket and flicked it. No, not a knife, a lighter made to look like a knife. He lit the spliff and began to choke on the smoke.
""This shit is better than anything we had back in the day. Come on, I'll warm up the generator. Try to stay entertained.""

My eyes returned to the horizon. The smoke was diminishing. Soon it would be impossible to tell the plane was there.

""So many people just died. I can't believe I'm the only survivor.""

But Brian was out of earshot. Or I was too weak to speak. Either way, I stumbled forward following Brian's cloud of smoke. Upon reaching the Gazeebo, Brian handed me the reefer and I took a drag. I coughed more than Brian did, my lungs still felt waterlogged.

A rumble and sputter and the generator came to life. Brian flicked on the 52 inch television, blew sand out of a gold cartridge, and plugged the cartridge into a rather beaten up looking system. I handed the spliff back and sat back into a very comfortable sofa. 

While Brian set up the menu and between coughs, he said, ""Anything you want here, you can have. If you're hungry, I've got a waffle maker and loads of microwaveable pizzas. There's a tarp in case it rains. I have three different kegs of beer. They're warm, unfortunately. Maybe you can help me with the refrigerator that washed up about a mile that way. Here, have another toke. You seem stressed. Sorry about the crash. I really tried to enjoy being lonely.""

Through the fuzz of the high, I felt a chill. Brian is responsible for the crash? Anything you want? I dropped the spliff.

""Hang on, am I dead? The plane goes down and I'm the only one to get out? No, no no no! This is a dream. I am still in the sky. Everything is fine. I will wake up in LA a little hungover. This is a dream, this is a dream.""

Brian signed and picked up the spliff, ""Please, Greg, try to stay calm. I wanted you here because you were the least flappable of all my buddies and the best at shooting the shit. I'm sorry you're here, but now that you are can we please make the best of it? Look, I'll let you be Oddjob, right? I'm sure you're out of practice.""
Brian tried to hand me a controller but I swatted it away.

""Anything I want right? I must be dreaming. What about those blonde girls in first class? They were too cute, why did they have to die?""

At that moment, two voices not speaking English were coming from beyond the canopy.

""Oh no Greg, what did you do.""

""Hallo? Hallooooo!"" The voices called. I looked beyond the large screen and saw two dishevelled blondes wearing white coming towards us. Then yapping coming from the shore behind me. A small crate with two small dogs had just washed ashore. One of the girls dashed to the beach, the other came to the Gazeebo. Greg put his head in his hands.

""Hallo, speak English?""

""Yes,"" I said, ""thank goodness I'm not the only survivor. Who are you?""

""Anna, were you both on the airplane? Oh mein Gott, so many people died. I hope they are okay.""

Brian groaned at this and puffed furiously at the remaining roach. Other survivors became visible in the water, clutching to various boxes and luggage. Anna began waving across the beach to her friend and both ran towards the shore and began helping people out of the water. Other detritus was washing up as well. I would have gotten up, but the sofa was too comfortable and I hadn't had any weed in a very long time. Then Brian wailed and began to sob, just as the earth gave a deep rumble I could feel in my bones.

""Oh no, oh no, not again not again, not again!""

""Brian, calm down. It's fine. People survived. We'll all be saved soon enough. I can see the pilot down there and he has some sort of radio. We will all be saved soon enough.""

""I'm sorry Greg, I couldn't help it. I'm so sorry. I tried not to, but... I wanted to be alone again!""

The horizon rose. The beach enlarged. A tower of water formed in the distance.

""I'm sorry Greg."" He said as he strapped on a life vest over his tuxedo. ""I'll try to get used to being lonely from now on.""",Scotoboros

[WP] Imagine life as a ghost,therealggamerguy,"I stood in the rain and it passed through me. The jackets and umbrellas of my family flapped and bucked in the October wind, but I didn’t feel it or smell the wet leaves that covered the ground. Preacher Davis read from his Bible only a few feet away—I was sure I’d recognize the words if I could hear them, but he was as silent as empty space.

The world was no more muted to look at than anyone would expect for a dismal autumn day, but every other sense was gone. I couldn’t feel my own weight on my feet, or the fingernails of my clenched fists biting into my palms. I only knew I was naked by looking down.

It was like a terrible dream. I’d tried to get their attention for the whole first day, but no amount of yelling or grabbing seemed to reach them. It was simple exhaustion that had finally made me accept the inevitable. If I couldn’t hear and feel my own sobbing, how could I expect them to?

I stood behind my wide headstone through the whole silent service. My buddies and my cousins hustled to their cars as soon as it was over, ducking out of the rain and the cold. My son stood there crying for a long time, his wife’s arm wrapped around him and her head laying against his arm. She held my grand-daughter too—a precious little bundle with alert brown eyes.

Finally even they were gone.

As soon as they were out of sight, the workers hired by the funeral home stepped in. It took them only minutes to bundle up the soggy sheet of artificial grass that they’d spread to keep the mud down and pull apart the metal frame that they’d used to lower the casket. My casket. It held a body that didn’t seem like part of me anymore.

They backed a small dump-truck of dirt up to the open hole and in seconds the casket was hidden forever. They gave it a lick and a promise with a rake and then they were gone too. I stood there alone, looking over the field of carved stones and feeling no more alive than any of them.

Something moved at the corner of my eye and a gravelly voice spoke. I hadn’t heard that voice in more than twenty years, but I knew it instantly. “Well, boy? Are you gonna join us or are you just gonna stand here and mope all day?”",RyanColvert

“Okay Frank three things.  First, that’s literally the stupidest plan I’ve ever heard of.  Second, why on earth would the aluminum utility building you put up last summer be haunted? Lastly, and most importantly, I still don’t care.”

“Alright Mr. Nonbeliever, why don’t you stick around here with me tonight?  I’ve got the video cameras set up with nightvision, and when we get the footage proving the existence of ghosts, BLAMMO we’ll be rich and famous.”

“Fine, but I literally can’t think of something that’s a bigger waste of time.”

Later that night, Frank and Carl set up shop in the corner of Frank’s shop building, taking care to hide behind some boxes.  Hours seemed to pass as Carl dozed on and off.  Frank, however, was glued to the camera.  “Carl, wake up, I got the footage!”

“Wait really?”

“Yeah, here take a look”

Carl was stunned.  Not only was there a ghost on the camera, Frank’s stupid plan apparently worked.  The next day they took the footage to the local TV station.  Frank walked straight past the receptionist into the general manager’s office, receptionist and several security guards yelling at him “Hey come back here” and “Sir, you can’t go back there”.  Frank explained to the station head his video and the manager called for his secretary to bring in a TV cart.  Crazy whack job or not, if this guy has proof this could be big news for Channel 6, the manager thought to himself.  Let’s see the guys down at Channel 4 top this.  

Frank played the video.  The station head looked confused.  “Sure that does look like a ghost, but how exactly does this prove the existence of ghosts?  Also, why on earth would ghosts want to haunt your aluminum building?”, the station head asked.

“See, we ghosts tend to float, meaning waist high obstacles they just float on through,” Frank explained.

“Okay, so that would explain all the boxes strewn about.”

“And then, well, I think this just about proves it.”  Frank unpaused the tape.  From the audio on the TV, the station head could hear Frank ask, “Hey are you a ghost?”  

“Yes...boooooo”, the ghost replied.

“Well gentlemen, that’s about all the proof I need.  I’ll get a team together and we’ll run the story on this evening’s news.   Since it’s almost noon, we’ll have to get the interviews with you after lunch.  You guys are welcome to have lunch in the cafeteria here if you’d like.  On the house, of course.”  

Frank and Carl walked to the cafeteria.  Unfortunately, there was no food being served at the moment, only a few maintenance staff attempting to clean up after a burst pipe.    Carl asked one of them what had happened.  “Burst pipe,” he explained.  “Had to clear out the area to get all that water up.”

“Oh.  Well is there anywhere nearby to grab a bite to eat?” Carl asked.

“Yeah, there’s a diner down the block to the left over by that furniture store.  Pretty good too.”

Carl and Frank left the station to get a bite to eat, walking past Shaggy Dog Furniture.  “So did you figure out why that ghost is haunting your workshop?” Carl asked.  “See, I got a theory.  I think the ghost may have been some sort of watier in life.”

“Oh yeah?”

“And with that furniture order I got from that new bar, I figure no wonder he’s haunting me.”

“I didn’t know you got a furniture order.”

“Yeah, didn’t I tell you?  Got the specifics for it last week.”

“Oh.  Well, that would explain the random tables…”

I mean this guy looked like a chain smoking brown boot that spent its whole life under the sun, worn by a hobo for the past 75 years. For pants he seemed to just be wearing a torn green sleeping bag tied to his waist with a shredded extension cord. Surprisingly he had a crisp, clean, all pink hello kitty T-Shirt on, 2 sizes too small for him- clearly stolen. He was tall, maybe six foot two. He wasn't fat, but his pudginess was very much exaggerated by the shirt- he looked like the Michelin man after 2 months of intense cardio on a restricted diet. In the same way gasoline fumes distort light, the stench coming off this guy was practically visible. 

""Y'boys gone done been here for long table while or somethin' y'tellme what?"" he said, slurring his speech, looking me dead in the eyes.

The hillbilly's eyes got real wide, I could see it had the effect I intended. He looked around the room, snorted and walked out.

Blinking as he reached for his glasses, he noticed the glow of the CCTV coming into view as the painting over the fireplace lowered. Fully awake now, he took note of the two shadowy forms stealing across the back green of Wayne Manor. Tripping over one another, they were not making great time, and to make matters worse it appeared they were making a mess of the landscaping. Glancing at the clock (2:38 AM), Alfred thought briefly about activating the Manor’s automated defense system, but thought better of it. 

“I haven’t had any fun in some time,” the septuagenarian butler mused, shrugging into his dressing gown and stepping into his slippers. Retrieving a silenced Remington 700 from the cabinet that had opened along with the CCTV’s activation, Alfred stepped to the balcony and raised his weapon.

“These motherfuckers should have picked on someone else. Master Wayne has enough on his mind already.”

"[WP] The Wet Bandits have chosen a very nice home to rob that has only one kid inside, whose parents recently died. That home is Wayne Manor.",ADudeLikeAnyOther,"As I was playing Call of Duty Black Ops III, the alarm wailed as it signaled an intruder on the back lawn, quadrant II. I quickly paused the game that I was dominating with a 3.2 kill/death ratio and switched on the nearby iPad. From my home security system app, I pulled up the feed and instantly recognized the three guys that were making their way around the lawn.

The Wet Bandits gang were here at last. They had been on the news recently in a string of other break-ins around Gotham. The notoriety of their smash and grab style, their speed, and finesse were second to none in the home raiding criminal world.

But why would they dare risk coming here? They should know we have cameras hidden in ever corner of our home and property. This was foolish on their part, and they have no clue of the suicide mission they are now attempting. Stopping them is going to be as simple as putting them to sleep with a couple of ""date rape drug"" canisters.

I quickly stuffed the iPad in pocket and hopped over the back of the sofa. From their, raced down the hallway took a right into dad's big game room. In here was his collection of taxidermy game he had hunted all over the world and collected throughout the years. I raced over to the fireplace and tapped three times on a specific spot in the lower left hand corner by the fire poker. I stepped onto the mat as the floor began to spin around me. On the other side of this secret passageway, was a long, dark hallway.

As I grabbed a nearby torch, I lit it with the lighter I carried in my pocket that I always had; for special occasions of course. As the fire licked the walls beside me, I was able to make my around. The smell was almost too much to bear is it screamed the age of this secret tunnel. It was built ages ago by my great grandfather during the industrialization era.

As I made my way to the control center, I took one more look at the iPad to see where they were. I spotted them entering through the backside door on the West part of the property by the tennis courts. They had used some sort of laser to cut through our military grade door windows. I was a little impressed by the technology they had with them. No matter, it will be over soon.

I raced to the gun cabinet and grabbed one of the largest ones. These bad boys were the ones that fired canisters with the largest firearm we had were the rocket launchers. We haven't had to use those yet, but I'll be ready when I need to.

As I loaded the sleeping canister into the weapon, I remembered that I did need to call the police. Even though I didn't need them for the job I was about to do, I did need them to clean up behind me. Carrying sleeping bandits to jail was not my cup of tea. I had Call of Duty to get back to.

I loaded up, lit the torch, and made my way down the corridor. This time, I was headed to the West side of the building to head them off. As I was making my way down the hall, I shot the police chief a text telling him that The Wet Bandits were caught, and they needed to meet me here to load em up.

When I got to the end of the hall, I decided to have a little fun with them. I got on the intercom system using my phone. ""You guys wanna play a game? I'll give you one minute to grab all you can before I put all you to sleep. Do I make myself clear?"" I watched on the camera feed that they had frozen in their tracks. They began to talk amongst themselves and continued to move forward. They turned into the next bedroom which happened to be one of the guest rooms.

They were sadly mistaken if they thought they would find something of value in there. Once their minute was up, I quickly opened the door west wing door, and cutoff their exit from the house. As I heard their footsteps coming down the hall, I fired two canisters in their direct path. Bullseye. All of three of them dispersed after they inhaled a good portion of the gas. Within seconds, they all dropped. I quickly tied them up with the rope I forgot to mention I grabbed and set them by the door for the police chief.

I text the chief and told him where they would be. He responded with a laughing emoji and that they were almost there. I left The Wet Bandits by the door and made my back to the den. I hope the server didn't time me out of my game, or I was going to be pissed.",frisky_business2

""Sorry, Harry."" Marv replied. ""It's just, I found this cave over behind the bushes. Something's makin' noises down there.""

""Caves? Who cares about caves?! Let's go. You remember the plan right?""

Marv looked puzzled for a moment. The plan...plan...Oh, right! The plan! Yeah! Course I remember the plan.""

Harry rolled his eyes as he rang the Waynes' doorbell. Alfred Pennyworth opened the door and answered in a very calm manor, ""Can I help you?"" 

""Hi, yes."" Harry said. ""We're pest inspectors, here to inspect your fine home today, you know, with the summertime rollin' around an' all. If you'd just allow us to search the premises for signs of pest damage, we'll take a look and be on our way.""

""I'm sorry, I don't think that's a very good idea."" Alfred replied. 

""Well, better safe than sorry; you know?"" said Harry. 

""Hm, now that you mention it, we've had a bit of a 'bat' problem the last few weeks.""

""Bats, huh?"" Marv said. ""We can do bats; can't we Harry?"" 

""Sure can, Marv."" The pair smiled at each other. 

""Very well then,"" Alfred replied. ""The bats seem to be coming from the cave out around that way."" He pointed across the yard. ""Young master Bruce recently fell in and was attacked by several hundreds. He's dreadfully frightened to go outside anymore.""

The crooks scurried back to their van, on which they had painted a fake pest company name, and grabbed their 'equipment' bag. 

""Bats?! Who has a *bat* problem in this city? Gee I tell ya, every day this job gets worse and worse, huh Marv?"" 

Marv wasn't paying attention. He had found some gunk underneath his fingernails that he was trying desperately to get out. 

""Marv!"" Harry yelled. Marv snapped back into reality and grabbed the bag, which was full of items they would use to break into Wayne Manor.

“Okay, so we do a little bat inspection, then when the butler isn’t watching us, we’ll sneak around back and find a way in. Sound like a plan?”

“Yeah, Harry, that sounds great!” Marv replied.

They approached the cave slowly. “Hey Harry.” Marv said. “Remember that noise I was talkin’ about earlier? That must’ve been the bats he was talkin’ about! By the sound I heard, I’d say there’s thousands of em’ down there. I dunno if it’s such a great idea to go in.”

“Thousands, Marv? You really think there’s thousands of bats own there? There’s probably a couple little rodents, that’s all. Scared of a little rat with wings?” 

Harry shook his head in disapproval and jumped straight into the cave. A second later, he was crawling back out as well over thousands of bats. “GAH! Hagga, fragga, saga, ghita bats off me Marv!” he screamed. Marv grabbed a wrench from the bag and began swatting at the creatures without successfully hitting one. They began attacking him too. 

Once the bats had gotten tired of attacking the freshly cut-up pair, they flew into the woods. Marv and Harry thought it safe enough to enter the cave now. “Okay, so we ‘do a little maintenance’ in the cave, come back out, and find our way in. At this point, I’ll break a window if I need to. I want whatever they got inside that house! I heard ol’ Martha Wayne has a priceless pearl collection.” They snuck into the cave, carefully this time, and sprayed some ‘pesticide’ that was really just water. 

“Hey, Harry!” shouted Marv. “Come look at this!” Marv had found a door in the far right corner of the cave. They both rushed to it immediately. 

“It’s unlocked.” Harry whispered. He pushed the door open and there was the Wayne Manor library. “Okay, we need to be quick. Grab everything you can.” They figured the shelves would be filled with one of a kind books so they shoved them at random into their bags and shirts. Suddenly, Marv pulled off a book that triggered the alarm. The noise was piercing. Both criminals looked at each other dumbfounded. Then, a young boy entered the library. 

“Who are you?” asked Bruce Wayne? “What do you want?” 

“Quick, get the kid!” shouted Harry. They dropped all the books and began chasing after Bruce. Bruce pulled a small, round object form his pocket, dropped it, and ran. A huge cloud of smoke blocked Harry and Marv’s sight as they began coughing. “What the hell was that?” yelled Harry. “Some kinda…smoke.” Replied Marv. The two waved the smoke from their faces as they made it to the hallway. Bruce had disappeared, but there was only one door on the other end of the hall. He couldn’t have made it that far. The criminals looked around for the boy, and finally ran toward the opposite door.

“Hey guys,” Bruce yelled from one of the rafters above them. He waved a gun-like object at them. “What do you think of my new toy? I call it a grappling hook. Comes in handy, don’t ya’ think?”

“Oh, you think you’re safe up there huh kid?” asked Harry. “Get your gun out Marv.” 

“Huh?” said Marv. 

“Your gun! Get your gun! Shoot that little punk!” 

Marv fumbled in his coat pocket for his pistol and after minutes of searching, he found it. He pointed the gun at Bruce when suddenly, half a dozen police officers busted through the library door. 

“Put the gun down!” yelled Jim Gordon.

Marv immediately dropped the weapon. 

“Step away from the kid and get on your knees!”

“Aw, fraagasaggitdaggarega.” Harry mumbled. “This ain’t ova kid! We’re gonna come back for you. You won’t always have your little toys and police friends to protect you ya’ know? I can’t wait for that day! You better be ready when we get out of prison!”

“Oh, I will be.” Bruce replied.

""What kind of stupid question is that? How the hell should I know what's in their freezer? Billionaires probably don't even eat Bagel Bites, you idiot.""

""Yeah, but if I were a billionaire, I'd buy a *whole lot* of Bagel Bites.""

""Marv, that's probably why you're not a billionaire. Now shut up, I think it's time to move. I haven't seen any movement since we got here and I know the owners are dead.""

The Wet Bandits had parked their run-down Chevy Astro about half a mile away from the biggest, most luxurious house in the entire city and waited for night to fall before making their move.

""Can you believe they didn't even hire security to keep the place safe?"" Harry asked, laughing. His gold tooth sparkled a little through the smile.

""Probably spent all the money on Bagel Bites.""

""Ah, Jesus, shut up already. You take the back entrance, I'm gonna try and break through the front somehow. Lots of windows and doors.""

The duo split, and Harry began to work on picking the front door's lock. Marv tip-toed around back to a stairwell that led up to a rear entrance. As he walked up to the door, a strange *click* came from the other side. When he tried to jimmy the doorknob, something surprised him- the door was unlocked. 

""Wow, Harry! These guys are total morons! The back door was unlocked, come around!"" he shouted to no avail. ""Huh, probably can't hear me. Oh well, I'll just unlock the front door.""

What he didn't know was that Harry *did* hear him, but was unable to respond because a military-grade taser had been rigged to fire when he stepped onto the doormat. Harry was convulsing on the ground, foaming slightly at the mouth, rigid as a board. 

Marv quietly and carefully walked into the rear mudroom, then through a large hallway and toward the front entrance. It was very dark, and none of the light switches worked.

""Maybe they shut the power off to save energy? Man, if I was a billionaire...""

He was unable to finish his sentence because to his right, in the kitchen, a piping-hot platter of Bagel Bites was set up on the counter. They looked so fresh and delicious, the smell entered his nostrils and he shivered with delight. He walked toward them, completely disregarding the fact that cooked food indicated someone was home, salivating and laughing.

When he went to reach one, his hand passed through the plate. He swiped again and again, but his hand couldn't grab hold of anything. 

""What the hell? Fake Bagel Bites? Is this a hologram?""

He stumbled forward, out of the kitchen, where an old lady was waiting for him.

""You will never have Bagel Bites again. If you do, I will kill you,"" the woman said ominously.

""G....grandma? But ..why? I love Bagel Bites....""

Immediately behind him, a tiny abomination appeared and shrieked like a banshee, leaving Marv crippled in fear and begging for his mother. He dropped to the floor, rocking back and forth, twitching and sobbing. The monster peeled it's mask off, revealing a gas mask underneath.

""Alfred, it's Wayne. Did the guy out front go down?"" the little boy asked calmly, blanket draped over his shoulders like a cape.

""Yes, Master Wayne. Are you okay on your end?"" the voice responded over a tiny intercomm.

""Yep, he's hallucinating like crazy. I can't believe that gas was so cheap yet incredibly effective.""

""Nor I, Master Wayne. I will call the police immediately. Detective Gordon will have a laugh about this when he hears of it.""

""Sure. Thanks for letting me mess with them a little, Alfred. I know you just wanted to call the cops but this was fun.""

""Of course, sir. We could all use a little fun sometimes, in the face of hardship.""

""Relax, Marv, the Waynes died years ago. Little Brucey probably still is maniacally depressed about it.""  
""I'm not too sure about that, Harry. Remember the Kevin incidents?""  
""SHUT UP, Marv! There is no way we are going to face a psycho child a 3rd time. Besides, Kevin was temporarily separated from his parents. Bruce lost his parents forever. the psychology works differently here.""  
Just moments later, the front gates opened and a car came out, driven by an older man with greying hair in a Tuxedo. ""Okay, Marv, this is our chance. his butler just left the house, probably for grocery shopping. Now get over that wall!"".

A few minutes after, Harry climbed over the wall. Cautiously taking a few steps forward, he soon relaxed. Marv followed him close behind. ""Looks like you're right, boss.""  
""I'm always right, Harry. Now go and disable the cameras.""  
Marv Merchants carefully approached the camera, taking care not to enter the field of view. He slightly cringed when a branch cracked, but he seemed to be fine. Right when he reached for the camera, he noticed a small patch of light grey gel on the wall to his right. ""What the..."" BOOM! Marv was thrown five feet away, in a nearby pit. Cries of pain escaped his lips, followed by a small groan. Harry looked on with barely contained fear. ""Marv? Are you alright?"" ""No, I'm not, Harry. I appear to have fallen on to something spikey"". Marv got upright with a painful grimace on his face. His back protruded with what looked like caltrops. Fortunately, they were tiny.

Bruce Wayne observed the events from his father's office and smiled. He had heard about this dastardly duo from Selina Kyle, who was visited earlier by these criminals. Selina was still pissed off about her ruined floors from the flooding. She would never get that deposit back. Bruce had let slip some rumours about his house being practically empty and unguarded and had sent out Alfred for some experimental prank tools from Wayne Enterprises. With the help of Selina and Alfred, he had installed them around his domain.  
""Alfred, the ham has bitten.""  
""Understood, master Bruce. Should I call Gordon now?""  
""No, Alfred, let them think they are safe. I understand that's how McCallister did it.""

Marv and Harry slowly made their way through the garden. As they approached a window, they started to regain confidence. Marv slowly slid open the window. then, it suddenly retracted all the way and a swarm of bats flew out, defecating as they exited the darkened room out of fear. Marv and Harry were covered in guano. Marv spat some of it that had landed in his mouth on the ground. ""I told you we shouldn't have come here. Let's run before it's too late!"". ""Relax Marv. This house is way too big for one kid. that room probably got infested with bats soon after his parents died, he just hadn't checked it yet. Come, help me through the window.""

""Selina, they've entered the bat coop. You're up next"". ""Acknowledged, Brucey. Do you want them spooked, rattled, terrified or just in fear?"" ""I'll leave it up to you, just don't kill them."" Selina Kyle exited the room, clad in her black leather costume. she waited in a dark corner of the main lobby for the bandits. A moment later, they appeared around the corner. Catwoman waited a moment for them to reach the right location, then hit a switch with her whip. out of the wall flew several small pellets towards the entrance. they exploded, filling the room with a dense smoke. Disoriented, Harry and Marv tripped and fell down a flight of stairs.

""Bruce, code red. The ham has fallen into the library. they're getting close to you."" ""Don't worry, Selina. part of my plan"". Bruce equipped his utility belt. These bandits would not need the full costume. More importantly, he did not want them to link Bruce Wayne to Batman. A moment later, Harry and Marv entered Thomas Wayne's office. Dumbfounded by the presence of Bruce, they stopped in shock.  
""Harry, I thought this house was supposed to just have a kid?""  
""I know Marv. I know. That dude with his creepy smile must have lied"".  
Bruce interrupted: ""The Joker is known to be somewhat... insincere with his remarks. I am Bruce Wayne, the owner of this house and sole resident, apart from Afred, my butler. I don't believe I have invited you two.""  
The poor bandits turned and tried to run, but the door had closed behind them. When they turned around again, Bruce Wayne had disappeared.

""Harry, I'm scared! How do we get out of this?""  
""I don't know Maaaaaarv"" Harry Lime screamed in fear, just as he was grabbed by someone and pulled into the air. Bruce Wayne, wearing a novelty rabbit mask he obtained from Jervis Tetch during a recent incident, held Harry in his grasp for a moment, only to drop him a moment later, the crook's fall being stopped a mere meter from the ground.

Marv was so scared at this point he gave the name ""Wet Bandits"" a new meaning. Screaming profanity, he ran to the center of the room. Looking around him in fear, he suddenly felt a sharp pain in the side of his head, falling on his back. The last thing he saw was the rear of a pair of tuxedo pants. The last thing he felt was an extremely strong punch in his groin, blacking him out from the pain.

""Alfred, you may call Commissioner Gordon now.""  
""Understood, master Bruce. Merry Christmas."" Bruce Wayne relaxed. this was a far better Christmas than his very first one. He dropped hints that he wanted to have a nice, relaxed Christmas for once, and Alfred delivered, as usual.  
""Merry Christmas, Alfred.""",realnzall

[Meanwhile, in Wayne Manor...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yic7IRO9d6I)

Bruce Wayne had been wary of his surroundings ever since his parents' deaths. It had only been a few years, yet the scene kept replaying in his head, especially his brush with death. The mugger had brutally murdered his parents in front of him, and the gun was pointed and cocked at a young Bruce. The criminal's finger was itching to pull back and end the life of a child, sparing him of the misery of growing up without parents. Instead, he said four words:

""See you around, kid.""

Bruce had since then committed his life to practical skills: the martial arts, archery, chemistry, criminology, forensics, gymnastics, and plenty more. He was only fourteen. He had a feeling that the Oh-Kay Plumbing and Heating van outside his mansion wasn't good news. Were these people stupid? He lived in a secluded mansion outside Gotham city and hadn't called a plumber. Did they think he never looked out a window?

Two thoughts occurred to Bruce: The first was to set lots of comical traps including heated doorknobs, paint cans, toy cars, and common house items. The other was to simply wait until later to kick their asses.

""Alfred!"" He called, ""Where's my super suit?""

"[WP] Tonight we dance the dance of death, not in sadness, but in joy.",Storiesforglories,"The city was infected.

Beyond measures through which the Rullah peacekeepers could ever hope to contain. For every Parasite they found, mimicking the true life whose huskes they now held hostage, five more might appear to resist them. Bodies of the long deceased, holding to the illusion of the living and striking without warning. They would burst from crowds, or perhaps worse: Retreat back into them, using the flock of refugees as cover, barriers and shields. There was no heisitation shown before drawing in civilians to the fray of violence, and the fighting had followed the natural course of escalation, reaching past the quiet shacks and indoor raids, and shifting to the streets. 

Gunfire and plasma burns evident along the structures of wood and dirt. The Flying low vessels, using precious power from the fragile grids in nightly raids, or the constant chatter on the comms. The City of Nekamtol was at war within itself, and under the cover of innocent lives, the two sides fought without mercy. Splashes of torched metal and wood were just as common now, as the stains of blood; if one were to inspect the shacks and shelters by which most of the inhabitants lived.

It was from the shadows of one such structure, that Cogha stood with the human as they watched their latest target. 

From a distance, they observed together, eye watching from their unseen alley, hiding in plain sight as the creature move. Thin and wiry limbs passed swiftly as the nimble species jogged in haphazard jumps through the side streets beyond the inner alleys of the city Nekamtol, and instead holding to those main arteries of foot traffic. An effort to blend within the crowd, Cogha had no doubts.

It would do the being little good, even in this region- where Peacekeeper surveillance was known to be lax to non-existent.

Any efforts to hide through the carefully replicated movements and disguise, would be irrelevant. No matter how convincingly it moved, the creature had been tagged by nanite respondents on a prior raid. To Cogha, or perhaps any of the Peacekeeper's eyes, it might seem normal- even the Human might stumble to identify it from a distance: But the Nanites and the tracked signals did not lie.

Void only knew this had taken time, careful and meticulous planning along with many sacrifices, and twice as many lives. The Parasites were cautious, intelligent, specific in their plans and interactions- difficult to trace, and even more so to follow... but that was at an end. For all the horrors the Gemynd were capable of, they had underestimated their foes.

This time for certain: It would end tonight.

The remaining Peacekeepers would find the source, and they would crush it. To stem the flow of these parasites- these Gemynd: *This time for certain.*

""Stay calm, Cogha.""

The Human turned to him, collar of the Trader's Guild catch the dull silver gleams, even in the darker portion of the shadows. Their acting tracker, and furious beast.

""We can see one, but there are always others."" His voice was a low hiss, pulling along the Union standard in a monotone growl as Cogha saw the whites of thick teeth behind curled lips.

""No more escapes. This ends today.""

Cogha met the creature's eyes, staring into those strange pits of white, brown, and black. Purple tinted them now, with strange flourishes along the center colors, mixing like murky water into the brown, surrounding the black. His Shipmaster, A Siren, had placed the creature under his command- but more often than not Cogha felt that such roles were reversed.

What those eyes could recognize, analyse and identify, was beyond any Rullah such as Cogha. 

As much as Rullah might claim to be hunters, the Human in his service was a predator in the flesh. A being of primal roots still fresh, with blood of generations not long since fighting for their own survival, on a planet few would envy. How the Siren had found such a beast, he could only imagine. 

The Shipmaster's record was none of his concern today though. Let the Trader's Guild sort such out, he would take their assistance without question until the work was done.

In the distance, the crowds parted as the target continued to move. Occasional glances watched for onlookers, cautious to the last. It still hadn't realized. The plan was working. 

Over the communication lines, Cogha connected to the main channel, signaling through the helmet pieces of seventeen Peacekeepers in unison: All that remained of his once full force. The last warriors under his command protecting this city, following him on a desperate gamble.

The stakes were too high for any to accept another option. Until the parasites were extinguished, none could leave- even if they could accept the dishonor of such a retreat. The risk of the Gemynd escaping was too great, and Nekamtol would burn from the fires above, as the *New Lines* drew back. Millions would be lost and none could be evacuated, and all for the risk they might pose. 

What was one city, on a single planet- when compared to the trillions of lives that still survived? That still fought in their resistance?

It weight down upon their backs and shoulders all the same: Millions of lives resting in the claws of Seventeen Peacekeepers.

Seventeen of the finest Rullah Cogha had ever been in command of, himself, and the human. To plan this operation, Cogha would have requested two hundred Keepers, but such a thing was no longer possible. They alone, would have to be enough.

They alone, waited on his word. 

Cogha began to speak, softly letting his voice pass through, passing along the frequencies that bound the communication array.

""I speak to you all with the knowledge that we may not survive."" 

The static grew quiet upon the line, as the others listened.

""We have hunted these creatures, and we have lost many. Our forces have suffered, or people have fallen. As friends were revealed as enemies, civilians shown to be terrorists, innocents turned to murderers."" 

His teeth gnashed with rage, as Cogha simmered the tone with a soft whisper to those listening.

""It has taken half a cycle to find this stage, and far too many lives lost early to the dance of death. Many with glory, many with honor- but all too early.""

The returned acknowledgements were fierce, with barks of agreement, sorrow, and hatred. They knew... They knew all too well.

""I speak to you my brothers, my sisters, my fellow Keepers of the Peace. If we fail today, this city will burn. The beings who depend upon us, who had fled the wars beyond our borders, will be lost. The Union and what remains of it, will weep as the sand beneath our feet turns to glass."" His voice raised, as far as he dared from the whisper over the line. ""But we will not fail today.""

""Tonight we dance the dance of death, not in sadness, but in joy.""

Cogha raised his weapon, as he took aim. Lining the sights down to the creature now opening the door, descending down the carved stairs of stone to the site they had long been searching. The source of all the terrors brought, the leaking plague of parasites and their desires.

""For even if my scales turn grey, my skin grows tight, and I embrace the dance of death: We will be victorious. This city will live.""

The lines grew silent, the comms grew flat, and the HUD signaled as the displays came online. The suit of mechanized shields fizzed to life with tiny cracks of blue current, as the human beside him tensed, muscles rippled for the charge. It was time.

""For Victory. For Honor. For the Union.""

Cogha fired.

This would end tonight.",wercwercwerc

Deep purple plumage decorated the slim body of the sacrifice's victim, netted skirts and a silky bodice rested against her torso.

Her name was Catherine and tonight she danced the the dance of death.

Everyone around her wore the bright colours of god, as if to show the sinner from the innocent. Whites and creams glistened in the soft glow of the moon, which in turn shunned the beautiful woman, neglecting her with its light. The person she danced with was strange, indeed he was.

Not only was he wearing teal, silver hair tumbled down pale skin tinted blue. Azure feathered wings burst from his back, ready to take flight.

They danced for a while. Catherine did not notice the crowds gathering around them as the clock struck eleven.

Eleven and fifteen. Prayers accompanied the music.

Eleven and thirty. The sacrifice was ready.

Eleven and fourth five. The dance continued and the knife was drawn.

Twelve. 

Blood seeped through silk. The man- no, angel smiled at her pitifully. Launching himself off the ground, he abandoned his dying partner. Giving her one last wave before she decended into hell, she waved back.

After seeing the ad in the paper, I had called. They transferred me through to a whispery-sounding man who introduced himself as Markus. We agreed to meet on a Friday afternoon once my classes were done for the day.

The front reception area was cozy. It was painted yellow and accented with oak furniture. A few elderly people say around at tables by themselves out with others, playing games. The nurse at the reception desk was middle-aged, with blonde hair swept back in a bun and dark framed glasses. She looked up and smiled. ""Who are you here to see, dear?""

""Markus?""

If possible she lit up even more. ""Oh! You're the young lady who answered his personal. It's so lovely of you to come in-- Markus is a sweet old gentleman, but he doesn't have any family to come in and visit. It's such a shame.""

I smiled in return, ""I usually volunteer downtown but I saw the ad and, well..."" I shrugged. I didn't really understand the pull the old man's words had on me.

The nurse got up and motioned for me to follow her, so I did. She led me to a fast corridor. ""Down this way and around to the left in room 512. Let any of us know if you need anything."" She put a hand on my arm as I started forward. ""And this isn't really a warning, dear, but Markus likes to tell stories. They're very good stories, mind you, and he tells them fantastically, but please do try and watch his enthusiasm. He's on heart medication so too much excitement isn't very good for him.""

I nodded, ""I'll keep that in mind, thank-you."" She let go of my arm and I headed down the hall she'd indicated. Unlike reception, this hallway was pale aqua. A few nurses and residents passed me by, each sharing a smile and a hello as we crossed paths. It did not escape my attention that, aside from the nurses, I saw no one under the age of sixty. It made my heart fall a little. Maybe I would visit here more as my volunteer work instead.

I was around the corner before I noticed it, a weight to the air. I paused, wondering if I had felt it before. Maybe the unexpected sadness of this place was getting to me.

As I drew closer to room 512, however, the weight grew. It pressed in at me from all sides with a feeling I could not recognise. I pondered this as I reached Markus' door and knocked. I was so deep in thought that I almost missed the shift ""come in"" that echoed from within.

Suddenly nervous, I opened the door only as much as I needed to stick my head in.

""Uhm, I was told this was Markus' room?"" I asked to the figure sitting at the window with their back to me.

""You must be Olivia! Come in, please!"" The same whispery voice of heard on the phone earlier this week answered. He slowly pulled himself from his chair as I closed the door behind me. He was thin, with a slight bend to his back, and was dressed in sharp black pants and a light yellow dress shirt with a light blue bow tie. As our eyes meet, my gaze locked with the palest blue eyes is ever seen. Those eyes widened in surprise and the man stopped in his tracks and took a deep breath. The grin that broke into his face was elated and he strode forward, moving much more spryly than he looked capable of.

I moved to meet Markus part-way. ""Yes, I'm Olivia. It's nice to meet you, Markus, but you didn't have to get up on my account!""

""Nonsense!"" He dismissed, ""A gentleman always stands for a lady. And you've come all this way to learn! I'm very grateful that there is still someone, at least, to listen."" He lifted a hand and I reached out to shake it. ""There is so very much for you to learn.""

The heaviness in the air hadn't let up this whole time. In fact, I wondered that it hadn't thickened with each passing moment. I was about to ask Markus if he noticed-- perhaps I was coming down with something and should put off my visit until I recovered-- when our hands clasped in greeting.

There was a sudden roar in my ears and the world tilted around me one way, then the other.

""And you smell of so much talent! I didn't expect-- well, I haven't seen anyone with talent like yours in... In centuries! It's just rolling off you!"" I wobbled where I stood, and was amazed when my legs didn't give way.

""Wha-- what are you--"" the words slurred out of my lips as the edges of my vision darkened.

""Oh! I'm so sorry, my dear. My skills are so smothered here by all this technology you lot have about, so this might not be the smoothest trip.""

""Trip? I managed, blinking as purposefully as I could. It didn't seem to help.

""Oh, and don't forget--"" he leaned in close and I could quite clearly see his pale blue eyes again, ""Find Bowen. Tell him Markus sent you.""

That was the last this I heard as my world went black.

"[WP] A family has just moved into a house that is haunted and is trying to force them out. However, the haunted house is trying in the most passive aggressive ways possible.",TheTrueFlexKavana,"Well, that’s weird, I thought, as I walked back towards the old Victorian house that my wife and I had just purchased. In my hand I held today’s mail, but within the pile of bills and coupons I also held a large stack of magazines. Titles such as Blush, Man’s Action, Playboy and Real Men seemed to scream from the cover pages. At first it seemed likely that someone had decided to play a prank on us by signing us up for all sorts of magazine subscriptions, but these magazines were dated in the 50s and 60s. They were all seemingly promiscuous though (as promiscuous as the 50s were allowed to be), so maybe it would be better if I hid them from Janet. She got so paranoid around what she considered to be “nudies.” 
Right before I reached the door, I heard Janet scream. My heart dropped to my chest as the spike of adrenaline bolted me forward. I ran into the foyer and up the stairs to find a drenched Janet wrapped in a large towel with shampoo dripping from her head. I immediately looked past her into the room behind her where the shower still ran. 
“What is it? What happened?” I asked, while consciously moving the magazines behind my back. 
“The toilet- it flushed.” She said, looking at me for all the world like it was my fault, even though I had been outside. “And because the toilet flushed the shower turned piping hot. You know we can’t use multiple water sources in older houses like this. Why would you flush the toilet when you knew I was in the shower?” 
“I didn’t,” I returned, exasperated by how easily Janet accused him. “I was out-“
“What is that?” She demanded, seeing the stack of mail I held behind my body. 
“Just the mail,” I replied, attempting to hide the magazines. “I was just going to-“
“Let me see.” 
I handed her the mail, magazines included. She took a look at the stack and then stared up at me in disgust. Without a sound she turned and stormed off towards the bedroom. 

3 WEEKS LATER

“Dishes don’t do themselves”
I stared at the post-it on the kitchen sink. I just don’t understand. I know I didn’t leave that note there for her. I guess that doesn’t matter, though. What matters is that Janet believes that I left it, and if Janet believes it then this is just one more thing to add to the list of reasons why she can’t even seem to be in the same room with me anymore. 
I can’t say I blame her. There are only two of us in the house, and yet somehow these notes keep popping up all over the place. Just last Thursday Janet had found a note inside the fridge that had kindly proposed that she might want to go purchase groceries. I mean, the note wasn’t wrong, but even still, I wasn’t the one who put it there. Then, when she finally did fill up the fridge with new food, the food items somehow were labeled with my name overnight! That one did start a monstrosity of a fight. 
The biggest fight, by far, was when Janet found a note on the bathroom scale that “suggested” she might look a bit better 15 pounds lighter. I slept on the living room couch for a few nights after that one. It was so strange though. Where could all these notes be coming from? I was seriously starting to wonder if maybe Janet was starting to lose her mind and placing the notes herself…. 

2 WEEKS LATER

I stood on the porch as I watched Janet drive off into the distance. The notes had become too much for her. I’m not surprised that this was all it took. There had been troubles in our marriage before we moved here. The only reason we had even bought this house was for a place to start new. I placed my hands in my pockets as Janet’s Toyota disappeared around a corner. To be honest, I can’t say I felt very sad. In fact, I was more relieved that the whole business was done. 
“Whew, boy, am I glad she is gone,” a voice right next to me stated. I jumped, spinning around. Beside me was a boy, nearly a man, no older than 22. He wore blue jeans and a red striped shirt and- oh yeah- he was completely transparent. I stared at the apparition before me, stunned to speechlessness. “I mean, come on, man. Your ol’ lady was kind of a nag. I’ve been trying to get her to leave for weeks! Now that she’s gone, let’s say we take a look through those magazines?”

I mean, I hadn't even had time to spill the pizza crumbs from dinner all over the floor, not of course saying that it would happen, but my point was mute. 

We moved from the sunny side of Colorado, to Texas in the middle of bum fuck nowhere. Every time I thought about it I rolled my eyes; mom wanted to raise cattle and chickens, so rather than be in town we were stuck in a ranch home with the closest civilization a couple hundred miles away. I was in hell, literal hell, and the house wasn't helping with it at all. 

I sighed, arranging the photos of my family on the table in the entrance to the house. My five year old brother was organizing the magnetic words on the fridge while my mother and father toiled in the kitchen, trying to procure some sort of food for the night. The metal frames were cold in my hands as the air conditioning had been slowly getting colder and colder. 

""Mom! Can you turn DOWN the AC?!?"" I was exasperated, tired of having to ask.  Even for the summer in Texas, nobody needed to have a house that was 50 degrees below 0; I didn't want to have to pull out my fricken comforter and fluffy blankets to keep warm in TEXAS?

""I already did! No need to yell about it,” she replied cooly, literally cooly, it was so cold in the damn house I was just about freezing my ass off. 

“Are you sure about that?” I asked sarcastically, rubbing my arms to try and get some feeling into them. I heard a disgruntled sigh, and I seemed to hear some laughter in the distance, “Gosh darn it I’ll do it myself!”

I finished adjusting the picture frames so that they were just one inch away from each other at a 60 degree angle feeling accomplished. I shivered, trying to find some sort of warmth, before going down the stairs to the thermostat. The little electronic box was about halfway up the wall, white with light grey buttons. As I looked closer I noticed that it was set to 45 degrees fahrenheit. Too damn cold I thought to myself, and started punching the buttons and to raise the temperature to a nice 60 degrees. 

The numbers rose to the corrected value, and I hummed happily. As I turned around, I had the slight suspicion of movement behind me, but didn’t see anything. Weird, I thought to myself, but then shrugged and trudged up the stairs to where dinner was waiting. 

A couple of hours later I looked over; I could feel the goosebumps on my arms, and the temperature hadn’t seemed to move. Even with the stifling 85 degree weather outside, the inside of the house was like an ice box. Sighing in exasperation I turned to walk through the living room and down to the AC unit again, but something caught my eye. 

The pictures that I had arranged had moved slightly, but still my hawk like gaze was drawn to it instantly. Somebody had moved each picture frame to about a 75 degree angle from each other. That wasn’t right.

“Who moved my pictures?” I questioned angrily to my family, but everyone responded with a shrug or a shake of their heads. What the hell was going on?

When I headed downstairs to check the thermostat I stood slightly confused, someone had set it right back at 50! It was like the house was trying to get back at us or something, it was damn weird. 

“Mom! We have to get an electrician or something in! The AC’s broken!” I yelled up the stairs. Exasperated, I reset the thermostat at 60 degrees again, and while I was walking up the stairs I swore I heard a creak in the floorboards. Just to double check I went down to the thermostat, just in time to see the numbers change from 54, 53, 52, 51, and then to 50.

“The fuck?” I asked outloud.

The next day we had the technician come in, and the only thing he could say is “I don’t know what your problem is? It seems to be working fine.” The thermostat stood at 60 degrees until he left, and then dropped straight down to 50. I was so done with this. 

A couple of hours later I was setting up my wall pictures - the windows were all open to try and heat up the house a little bit, but it wasn’t helping much. It seemed like every vent I walked by opened up to spray me with cold air; and the worst part is that NOBODY else seemed to be having this problem. 

For the next couple of days, all of the wall photos were slightly leaning to one side or another, and every time I adjusted them, right when I turned my back they would just go back to being slanted. It was to the point that I had a permanent headache. 

“I’m moving out…” I finally complained to my mom, and all she did was roll her eyes, “This house is KILLING me. I swear it just wants us to leave or something…”

It was then that my attention was drawn to the fridge letters. They were moving all on their own; I stared, terrified of what was going on. As the magnetic letters settled, I read the single word out loud, “Please?”

The house was haunted, I was sure of it.",Silverstormwing

However, the haunted house is trying in the most passive aggressive ways possible.",TheTrueFlexKavana,"""Nice decor."" Laney leaned against the blood-spattered walls.  ""Didn't know that wallpaper came in that pattern...""

I sighed.  ""I swear to God, Laney, I'm not a psychopath.  Ever since we moved in, some prankster's been doing this to us.  Trying to make us think the house is haunted.  One day we'll catch the culprit, but for now, all we can do is file insurance reports.""

""Haven't you tried recording them?"" she ran a finger across one of the fresher smears, and took a whiff.  ""Dude.  Damien.  This smells like iron.  Either you've got a *really* committed prankster, or this is real blood.""

""Of course we've tried recording them!"" I replied.  ""It was the first thing that we tried!  But when we watched the video in the morning, there was nothing but static.  A solid eight hours of static.  Or, probably a solid eight hours of static, I didn't bother watching the whole thing.  Anyways, do you want to go up to my room and watch Netflix?""

She shrugged. ""Sure.  But next time, we're going to my place.  This house gives me the creeps.""

We headed to the stairway, and there, a message was waiting for us.

*You know that these walls are really thin, right?*

Laney shuddered. ""Ew!  Gross!  What does that even mean?  Can the neighbors *hear* us?""  Backing away from the staircase, she grabbed her backpack, gaze darting towards the front door.  ""Look.  Damien, it was cool hanging out today, but I think we should raincheck on the Netflix and chill.  We can hang out at my house some other time.  Later!""

""Wait! Laney- "" 

Before I could finish my plea, she had already made her escape.  

""Well, that's bloody great.""  I kicked the staircase, which turned out to be much more solid than I had expected it to be.  ""Ow!""

The sound of shattering porcelain came from the kitchen.  Grabbing a dustpan and a broom, I headed over.  ""Stupid house.  Stupid staircase.  Stupid blood-spattered walls.  Stupid pranksters.  I never wanted to move in the first place, anyways.  It was all Mom's idea.  'Let's move into a big house!  We'll have so much space!'""  

My favorite mug lay on the floor, smashed into an irreparable mess.  There was a small sticky note on the counter.  

*Sorry.  It was an accident.*

""God fucking damnit!""  I hurled the dustpan into the corner.  

I took a deep breath.  Getting angry would get me nowhere.  First, I had to clean up this mess.  Then, I would figure out who was doing this, and I would get revenge.  Heading towards the corner to pick up the dustpan, I noticed another sticky note on the floor.

*The last owner used to vacuum the house twice every week, and you only do it once a month.*",versenwald3
"[WP] A family has just moved into a house that is haunted and is trying to force them out. However, the haunted house is trying in the most passive aggressive ways possible.",TheTrueFlexKavana,"The morning silence was broken by a woman's scream.

Danny, the husband, recognized his wife's voice and took the stairs two steps at a time. He burst into the bathroom and shouted, ""What's wrong?""

""I thought you were going to do the dishes *after* I showered!"" said his wife, Regina. ""I just shampooed my hair and then all the hot water disappeared!""

""I swear I set a delay on the dishwasher. Let me go check."" said Danny, sneaking a quick peek at Regina before scurrying away from her wrath. When he got to the kitchen the dishwasher still had an hour left before it was set to start. ""That's odd,"" he muttered, ""better check the hot water tank.""

Danny set off for the basement. The lights flickered as he flipped the switch at the top of the stairs; Danny made a mental note to check the wiring later. Each step groaned as he worked his way downstairs, one or two even bowing treacherously under his weight. *Did they do that before?* Danny wasn't sure.

Danny and Regina had bought this house as a starter home. The previous owner, a lovely old woman who called the property ""a bit of a fixer-upper"", accepted their first offer before the ink dried. They should have been suspicious given the low asking price relative to other homes in the area but the deal was too good to pass up.

As Danny made his way to the hot water tank he heard the shower stop; it seemed Regina had finished without further incident. The tank looked fine and the hot water pipe was warm to the touch. He jiggled the pressure relief valve and a sputter of steamy water escaped.

Since he was in the basement anyway, Danny checked the electrical panel. *That's odd, the breaker for the tank is off.* Even if the breaker had flipped much earlier Regina still wouldn't have run out of hot water without warning. Danny scratched his head and flipped the breaker back on. As he did, the lights went out.

Upstairs, Regina had just wrapped herself in a towel when she heard a syncopated drip from the faucet. *Bit of a fixer-upper, my ass.* She dropped a hand towel into the sink to dampen the sound and stuck her tongue out at the faucet.

As Regina brushed her teeth she noticed the walls were... sweating. Maybe because she forgot to turn the fan on. ""At least they're not bleeding..."" she muttered. From downstairs she heard a loud crash, followed by Danny yelling. This was not a new occurrence however, so she carried on.

When they met in the kitchen, Danny was holding a bag of frozen peas to his head. ""The lights went out while I was in the basement."" he said. ""I walked into a post.""

Regina poked at the lump that was forming. ""Did you figure out the problem?""

""Not yet."" he admitted, ""And right now, I'm all out of ideas.""

""Maybe the house is haunted."" offered Regina with a chuckle.

""Maybe."" Laughed Danny.

Meanwhile, the house was out of ideas too. It had tried everything it could think of but they just wouldn't leave. A sigh echoed through the vents as the foundation settled. ",YDAQ

[WP] A fantasy Elf finds his/her self in a modern city.,afrustratedfapper,"Eldorin awoke to the sound of a devilish horn and screaming in a strange tung. He looked around and saw he was in a alley between two great towers of stone. He got up to go find out where he was. Surely this place was of dwarven design. As he got up to leave the alley several beasts in colorful armor ran by. Eldorin darted back into the alley and tripped over a man sleeping amongst piles of parchment scrolls. The man awoke and looked at Eldorin with surprise.
“I am Eldorin, first born of Valin and Mezamir, warden of the Guelith forest and champion of the mythril blade. You have a sizable collection of scrolls you must be a scholar so tell me: Which way is the road to Ethwal Hicapita.” Said Eldorin 
The scholar slowly reached into his cart that looked like a cage and pulled out a hat made of crumpled thin metal and put it on his head. Then he spoke: “So you are from a… different realm”
“Is this not the continent draenei?”
“No, this is Manhattan”
“Curse Mora, I have been transported to another realm! Scholar, where is the nearest place I can board a ship. I need to find the realm traveler Siriah she can be found on any realm of existence.”
“Laguardia is only a half an hour ride away from here, you could get on a plane from there. It will be faster than any boat”
“Thank you scholar. I am off, towards Laguardia.”

Agent Cain of homeland security looked across the table at the person the TSA had detained. He was in his thirties, about five feet tall, was very fat, and had a mullet.
“What's your name” asked agent Cain
“I am Eldorin, first born of Valin and Mezamir, warden of the Guelith forest and champ-”
“I’m going to have to interrupt you. This file says that your Edward Dorin, you work at a LARP store in Queens, and that your parents claim you on a dependent on their taxes so cut the shit and tell us why you tried to board a flight to istanbul without a passport.”
“I must go to Siriah, the great scholar told me Istanbul is the closest i could get.”
“Why were you planning to go to Syria?”
“To get back to where I belong.”
Agent Cain stood up and walked out of the room. He got out his phone and dialed a number.
“Hello, sir we have a problem there seems to be somebody in new york recruiting people for ISIS, and he calls himself the scholar.

[WP] A fantasy Elf finds his/her self in a modern city.,afrustratedfapper,"
Effi was overwhelmed. All around her were megastructures of glass and steel that seemed to scrape the sky itself. Countless metal beasts in a variety of coulors rumbled down a road while at either side humans walked in and out of the structures in great numbers. She was surely a long way from her little elven village. Never before had she seen nor heard of such a place.
Stumbling through the crowds, Effi found navigating her way around this strange new land a nightmare. She stopped inside one of the structures to get her bearings. 
The Interior seemed to have several isles stocked with small boxes and cases decorated with strange pictures and a dialect of writing she did not recognise. Humans lazily browsed up and down the aisles. Three more humans with bored expressions on their faces stood at the back of the building behind desks.
Effi noticed an oddity, the humans of this land seemed much fairer in complexion than those she was familiar with. They were still short with rounded ears and less angular features, most however were significantly more kempt. A lack of dirty beards and greasy hair was evident. Their clothes were cleaner, more colourful and varied. She could not differentiate between the peasants from the noblemen. Could they have built these massive structures? The thought of how they could accomplish such a task made her mind reel. If it was indeed the humans of this land who built it then they must have made significant use of sorcery. Enough to put even her clan’s most powerful mages to shame.
She was broken out of her deep thought as she noticed someone approaching. A human boy paced toward her nervously, flinching as her gaze met his. “uhh, hey” He stuttered nervously. 

“Speak” Effi responded curtly.

“Your cosplay is great, do you mind if I take a picture?”

After thinking for a minute, Effi decided it was probably a cultural norm in this place to “take a picture” with complete strangers.

“Very well, go ahead”

What the human did next confused Effi somewhat. He retrieved a strange object from the pocket of his jacket and aimed it at her. Instinctively, she reached for her dagger at her hip. As her hand made contact with the hilt a flash emitted from the device the human was using followed by a strange clicking sound.

The human thanked her and was about leave when she stopped him by grabbing his shoulder and holding on firmly.

The boy looked over his shoulder at her, a startled expression on his face.

“Where am I? What land is this?” Effi asked.

The boy continued to stare with that stupid shocked expression. She almost wanted to smack it off his face like it was an intruding insect.

“Tell me the name of this city!” she almost shouted.

“New…New York!” the boy hastily responded before adding quietly “you’re making me uncomfortable and people are staring”

She held on for a moment but turned her head as she felt a presence behind her.

“Mam, Sir, I’m going to have to ask you to leave” said a fat, bald, and tall human male. 
The human boy gave her a pressing look.

“Come on, let’s leave and I’ll tell you whatever you wanna know when we are outta here” he urged her.

“Very well, but I have my eye on you. If you leave my sight and attempt to escape I will make you regret it” She said reluctantly and ushered him out the door.

The two moved through the crowds barely keeping together amidst the constant noise of honking and shouting until Effi pulled the boy into an alley and out of sight. 

“Oh god, you’re going to mug me now aren’t you?” said the human.

“No, I merely want answers, for a start what is your name?” The elf responded.

“Mike, my names Mike…”

“Thank you… Mike” she pronounced his alien name slowly “I am Effi Lynnara, Warlock of the clan Leaf upon the Wind. In what direction is the human city of Havenrock?” If she could find Havenrock then she would have no trouble getting home from there.

Mike looked at her with that puzzled expression once more. “I can’t tell if you’re being serious or you’re just really devoted to your character.”

“I do not know what you mean” the two stared awkwardly at each other for a few moments until the Elf said “Is there a place we can eat near here? Perhaps it would be easier to discuss such things on a full stomach.”

“Yeah, there’s a good pizza place just down the road a bit. I’ll lead the way” Mike said with relief.

Pizza? Human cuisine, from her experience is crude but that actually sounded interesting. Effi thought to herself. This was going to be an interesting day indeed.





Well this has been an interesting day so far. Mike thought to himself.  This woman is a daunting puzzle, who or what is she? She obviously can’t be an actual Elf, even though she damn well looked convincing, right down to the ears height and face. He was sure he wasn’t dreaming, his dreams were significantly more haphazard and surrealistic. Effi wasn’t just a pretty face in ornate armour, she was quite tall with defined muscles. He was pretty sure she was at least the same height as his high school football coach who was a menacing six foot three inches. Her face was almost immaculate save for a large scar that marred her features. He felt intimidated by her to say the very least and the more he looked at her the more convincing she seemed.

They reached the restaurant, a large neon sign depicting two burly men in chef outfits and moustaches along with the name “Dough Bros” illuminated the front of the building. Possibly the brightest thing on the block. 

“Alright this is it.” Mike said as he turned to face Effi “please don’t cause a scene.”

They walked in and a dishevelled greeter looked up from his phone, showed them to a booth near the back of the restaurant and handed them the menu.  

“I can’t read this…” Effi spoke up gesturing to the menu and looking frustrated.

Mike who was engrossed in his copy almost jumped out of his seat. 

“Umm… here lemme help you with that” Mike insisted.

“So this one here is the margarita, that’s just a plain pizza with cheese an-”

“What would you recommend?” she interrupted.

“umm... well I’m having the pepperoni, that’s- “

“I’ll have that” 

“Alright then, you got any money”

Effi looked at him blankly. 

“I’ll take that as a No.” Mike said with a sigh. He assumed it would be in the best interests of his health not to say no to her. 

“Fine I’ll pay” he moaned. This was going to be an interesting day indeed, and Mike wasn’t sure if he’d live it through.

The elf has an appetite, Mike thought to himself as he relaxed in his seat. She easily got through her own meal, and finished the half he left with great vigour.  He had barely stuttered “I can’t eat anymore” before she snatched it up and devoured it in almost a minute. Mike gave her story some more thought. The more he looked at her the more he was convinced she was for real. She did not look human. Her features looked real. Her pointed ears did not look plastic, her elven eyes were certainly not contact lenses. He doubted anyone would go through all this effort to maintain their character and trick gullible people like him into buying her pizza. 

“You’re for real, aren’t you?” He finally spoke up.

“Pardon?”

“You’re an honest to god legitimate…. Elf”

Effi narrowed her eyes. “You seem surprised” she responded.

“But that’s not possible….”

Effi leaned forward and propped her head on her hands. “Did your mother and father tell you we aren’t real? It is not uncommon for humans to do that, they don’t want their children running off into the wilderness on an adventure to “find the elves”, I don’t blame them. The wilderness has many dangers. I could tell you a tale of the beast who gave me this.” She traced her finger along a scar that began above her eye and ended halfway down her cheek. 
“No… you don’t understand, Elves are meant to be a work of fiction. I’ve never heard of a city called Havenrock, you are a really long way from home. If you can even measure that with distance… look I can get you a map of our world, you can see for yourself” Mike explained as he fumbled in his pockets for his cell phone.

Effi leaned over, curious about this strange device the human possessed. Her eyes widened in surprise as a light emitted from the device revealing a picture of a furry creature staring right back at her. The picture quickly changed as the human went to work on it, the pictures changed as he tapped the device rapidly. Before she knew it she was looking at a map of some kind. As the human seemed to suggest, it was nothing like the maps she had seen of the world.

“This is where we are”, the human said as he made a reverse pinching movement with his fingers on the western continent.

Effi had seen enough and was now leaning back against her chair in deep thought as she attempted to process this information. It seemed as if she would be staying here for a while. She was going to miss her village, but this new world was strange and had many wonders. A smile graced her features as she considered her next move.

[WP] Tell the tale of a teenage boy trying to romance a cheerleader... In the most cringe-worthy way possible.,throwaway12731273,"It's not like Joe was the only teenage horrorshow to try to get in my pants, there were several, while I was not the hottest cheerleader I was not the ugliest either. My mother told me at an early age that I had a modest beauty which often progressed into aesthetic beauty as I got older and it did, but I'm here to tell you about Joe.

It was freshmen year in high school over the summer I had broken up with my previous boyfriend from middle school, you guessed it, Joe McClensky. Joe saw it as a hiatus more than a complete break up. It's like he was irrefutably oblivious to the fact that we were completely done. He wrote me twenty letters over the summer when I refused to take his calls. It was embarrassing and tedious having to explain to every individual why Joe still acted like this.

Anyways, it was my very first fucking day at the high school and the school's auditorium was being renovated so we had assembly out on the school football field. To this day, I still don't know how Joe got this done only thing I can imagine is that he had some buddies in the AV club to help him.

There I was expecting a speech from the principal welcoming all the freshmen when a familiar song slowly began gaining volume on the PA. The principal was trying to talk but his mic was not working and that is when Joe came running out onto the field, his hair dyed blonde witha fucking microphone in his hand. It was like watching a trainwreck in progress the only response that could be applied is an audience.

It was a greasy fucking horror show, the live action big screen monitors sprang to live with cheesy special effects zooming in on his face as he began the opening chorus of the song I most hated of 1999. Being played in 2001.

[""Come my lady. Come. Come. M'Lady your my butterfly Shuga Baby.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXnF7fCCVzY)

The zip line cameras pivoted to the girl sitting next me but regained focus on me as I tried to dodge behind my friend, who also moved. The entire crowd laughing at this attempt to not be discovered.

He got half way through the entire song before some seniors tackled him to the ground and wrestled the mic away. Back then it was the most pathetic display of hopeless romanticism I had ever witnessed on any one. Now though, I look back on it with slight fondness that someone felt so motivated to have me in their life they sang a stupid song in front of a whole class of freshmen.    ",KANNABULL

"[WP] An alien invading force is baffled by a simplistic code that humans decode easily, but their top code breakers cannot crack.",Airship_Aficionado,"In a human military installation, repurposed for suppressing the earth rebels, the commander of the cryptology division stood attentively as the consultant assigned to assist with the difficult quandary the expeditionary force faced entered the plannng room.

""Zrhg Breet, Alazonacrow"" said the consultant.

""Salutations, Zermoux"" replied the commander.

""Tvb kl?"" Zermoux looked confused.

""Oh, I mean, Zrhg, Zhrg."" Alazonacrow stepped quickly over to a nearby desk, and grabbed a metallix headset, then extended it towards Zermoux, saying ""Klary Zoilking ji, wwwwww."" 

Zermoux donned the headset, and Alazonacrow began again in English, ""Sorry, but we've gotten in the habit here of speaking in the local dialect, we hope it will give us an edge in figuring out their new code system.""

Zermoux's brow furrowed, and his raspy sounding voice synthesizer seamlessly translated for him, ""These savages really have you stumped, eh, Al?""

""Any species that can devise a code such as this one could never be totally savage."" Responded the commander tersely.

""Starting to become fond of the humans, are we, Commander? Speaking their base language, complimenting their tactics. Maybe you should adopt one of them, as they like to do with their lesser species. What is the phrase that's got you stumped?""

Al turned towards a large screen and spoke in Alien, ""KR1, Lop gi X-17, hr English."" On the screen appeared to lines in greentext. ""The top"" elaborated Al, ""is our translation, but that's basically useless to us. The human version of it says 'Don't grab a coffee at Central Perk tomorrow.'"" Al turned back to look at Zermoux, and added, ""Somehow this was a message that alerted humans of an attack in their New York City earlier this month.""

Zermoux looked thoughtful. ""If they had a code as good as this all along, why were their initial communiques done with those laughably simple encryptions? There have been no cipher devices of any kind detected? Do humans have telepathy or something?""

Al sighed wearily. ""We haven't turned up any form of decoding device. We have instances of some humans appearing to ask for clarification, but those too appear to be encoded.""
""What was the clarification?"" inquired Zermoux.

""Oh, uh, it just said: 'Your Friends will know.'"" Said the commander tiredly, then he continued, ""This whole operation has become a mess since they began this new encryption system. I get hammered everyday to crack it, but there is no rhyme or reason. One message was ""Bugs made a wise decision by taking a wrong turn"" and the next day, our Albequerque outpost is destroyed. Hardly any casualties for humans. Or the fake election posters for a man named Pedro somehow being a secret message.""

"[WP] When two people wake up in each other's bodies, it's comedy. When everyone on Earth switches bodies, it's chaos.",FuckYeahDecimeters,"That day I woke up and it was a normal day. That was for nature for us people it was the strangest thing ever. Everybody in the world was swapped with other people. 

That day I woke up in a really weird situation which left we quite confused when I woke up. I woke up feeling to say the least different. I opened my eyes slowly and moaned. But something was off my voice sounded a lot higher than usual. I went to get out of bed when I noticed I wasn't in my home.

I looked around my room seeing that everything was more girly. There were makeup cases, clothes and much more things I didn't recognize in that room. I looked down checking if something had happened to me but I saw I was wearing different clothes I grabbed my crouch which really I didn't because to my surprise I was a girl!

I rushed to look for a bathroom thinking two outcomes, either I was in a different universe all together or I'm in a different body. I found a door to the bathroom I assumed and found a mirror in the room so I could see what I looked like. I was Amy Swortsenburg, a very popular girl in my school. I pinched myself thinking this was just a dream but it just hurt. 

I was now a brunette with long brown hair and two big boobs. Rumors were spread all across the male community of the school about Amy's breast size but the main consensus was either D or DD. 

I quickly rushed downstairs and to no surprise the people were Amy's parents. Something was off though and from what I could see they were different people. 

Eventually after hours of confusion a news article was quickly rushed out onto all channels and it was saying to go to town hall to register who we actually are. Eventually I got assigned back to my parents who looked much different but lucky them they were both the same gender as they originally were. They both had a smile on there face saying they were happy to see me but I knew my mom's grin was because I was a girl.

It seemed as if everyone was switched with others in the world but everyone seemed to get switched with people who lived relatively close to them and were the same age as them. Eventually one week later we were all back at our own homes and family's.

School eventually resumed about 2 weeks after the whole thing and we all were wearing name tags that had our names on them. I was walking through the halls when a blond haired girl stopped me and looking at her name tag it was my best friend Katie. She chuckled when she saw me and said to meet her at lunch. 

At lunch we talked about our experiences and what our first moments were like. I was blushing because it was very weird talking to her as a girl and that was when she decided to invite me to her place for some quote on quote ""serious talk"". 

When I got to her place she asked me if I had any real clothes to wear other than my school uniform I had to buy. I said no and that was the one word that resulted in me spending the entire 5 to 9 pm clothes shopping. When we ended the day I had 13 new outfits all of which thankfully were pretty gender neutral thanks to the fact that Katie was what you would call a gamer girl. Of course this didn't stop her from slipping 8 skirts into those 10 outfits and 1 bathing suit.

I started getting pep talks in certain subjects over time while just hanging out with Katie and life eventually got to about the same place as before. Really this couldn't be said for everyone but in the end it all turned out good and I was content with how it all ended.

"[WP] When two people wake up in each other's bodies, it's comedy. When everyone on Earth switches bodies, it's chaos.",FuckYeahDecimeters,"My eyes opened to an unfamiliar ceiling. A scream had jolted me awake. Somewhere in the building, another man yelled.

*Where am I?* I thought. *Had I been drunk?* I didn't remember drinking. I had finished work, curled up in the couch with my boyfriend to watch The Walking Dead. 

More screams followed, sending chills up my spine. Something was very wrong. I wasn't in my own room, and judging by all the noise this early in the morning, it was as if I had entered the zombie apocalypse.

The room was decidedly feminine. The bed I was on had flowery prints in light pink and purple. In the corner stood a vanity filled with all kinds of make up. I absent-mindedly reached down to scratch my balls and found *nothing*.

I peeked down at my slim hairless legs. Where they met, there was *nothing*. 

I rushed to the vanity and checked out my face. I had gone to sleep a man, and woken up a petite woman, in a strange room. The screams continued, and I suspected I hadn't been the only one.

I turned on the TV to CNN. A fat black woman was reading the news but there was something manly and familiar about her. 

""Numerous reports of swapped bodies world-wide. It looks like no one has been spared. This is Anderson Cooper signing off."" He looked distraught as he said his last few words.

I wondered whom Hoc, my boyfriend, had swapped bodies with. Would he still love me in this body? Would I still love him?",rayn13
"[WP] When two people wake up in each other's bodies, it's comedy. When everyone on Earth switches bodies, it's chaos.",FuckYeahDecimeters,"Sally Cane, previously a sultry brunette who did the 20:00 o’clock news, had swapped bodies with our high school janitor. In the midst of the madness, they actually had her—him do the news. His hair was combed back, in a failed attempt to cover Marv’s receding hairline. 

“Our top story tonight,” she said in the hoarse voice of a fifty year old smoker, “is the inexplicable, worldwide, body switch.” 

Her eyes were bloodshot. I didn’t blame her, grabbing the short end of stick with Marv was the least of her problems. Who knew the state her body would be in when and if we ever switched back.  He was having the time of his life with her, no doubt. 

“The United States has teamed up with Russia, China and members of the European Union to track down the source of the mayhem,” she continued, keeping her composure. I don’t know how she did it, but she made Marv seem sane—graceful even. Seeing him dressed up in a suit and shaven was a bit of a surprise, never mind on the screen of my TV.  I’d seen that man throw juniors with banana peels for not chucking them into the right bin. 

We had yet to track down my mother. Everyone else in the family was on their way or already here. Lucy Cavanagh sat on the porch, avoiding any sort of news or mirrors. She was here at 05:00, breaking down our front door before anyone even knew what had happened. Mom was already gone, and dad ran out screaming, later to return in the body of George, our family doctor.

“Damn it, Lucy,” I said and jumped off the couch, smelling smoke. “You put that out!” I didn’t know whether to slap the cigarette out of her hand or smoke it.
Lucy had been a smoker since 6th grade. My chest contracted with cravings, a feeling of desperate hunger rose in my chest, making even my arms feel slightly weaker. Today wasn’t a great time to start curbing addictions.  

She turned lazily, and waved me away with her hand. “Can you just leave me alone?” she asked, blowing out smoke. Every part of my being told me to sit next to her and suck in the smoke, but I sat back down, holding my hand over my face so I didn’t have to see her.

“The White House has yet to release a statement on the whereabouts of the President.”

*Yeah, that’s because they don’t know where he is.* Four banks had been robbed, or four that we knew of. People waited in lines at the ATMs, trying to save whatever they could. The banks, airports, and stores were closed. Riots broke out in just above every major city.

Our little street had been busy all morning, when seven cars would usually be considered a lot during the day.

I turned to the room my dad disappeared to. He was phoning around trying to track down my mother. No one saw her when she left this morning. I was past worried. 

 “Let’s go, Lucy,” I said, walking over to the door. 

She looked up. I wished she combed my hair. Getting all the knots was going to be a nightmare. “I want to look for my mom. I can’t just sit here.”

“I’m down.” She stood, stretching her back. 

Just as we got to the steps, a black SUV pulled up into the drive way. A tall man stepped out. Lucy and I exchanged a glance and waited to see what he was doing. He looked familiar, but it was dark where he stood, and I was having a hard time placing him in my town, never mind the driveway of my house.

He ran up to Lucy and wrapped her in a tight hug. “Sweetheart,” he crooned, letting go and looking her over. 

“Mom, is that you?” I asked.

He turned, lifting an auburn eyebrow. *Bryan Cranston.*My mom was Walter freaking White. He had been clean shaven, and looked a bit older, but that was him. Now that he—she stood under the porch light I was sure of it. 

“Kate?” she asked.

“Does he know? Oh my god, did he see you? What did he say?” I stood motionless, questions flooding my brain from all directions. *Was he going to come here?*

“Who, honey?”

“Mom, I need you to say something.” Lucy turned in my direction, with a knowing look on her face, smiling. “Say, I am the one who knocks.”

"[WP] With your writing, show me Freedom.",Goodnewsonlyplease,"   The place was dank as a tomb, and all the men and women hurried about like ornaments animated against the night.  But he sat in his chair, each leg intimately brushing against the pilings, like a port of call.  The wood creaked underfoot and the silver sang dissonance.  

With that pubescent little way about her, she glided through the doorway, and he held out his glass.

   “Someone’s thirsty,” she said, as she made way to the claw-footed chair beside him.
  
 “Does he still call you those names?”
 
  “What names?”
 
  “I don’t know, Monday?”
 
  “Well, it’s only Saturday!”
  
 She moved like a symphony, erupting past his door once, and he nearly tinged the nape of the moon.  But he never crossed his legs, and the laughing man never drew his blinds.
   
Presently, the congregation assumed their places, and the laughing man sat two seats down and rested his hand on her leg.  He could feel their eyes fixed upon him while his napkin lay precariously across his kinetic thigh, and the laughing man looked away and raised a toast.
 
  “Isn’t the point to love and convey his message?  No matter what? Like humming to some unknown tune? Negotiating the trial of life through his lens? Well, without him...”
  
 He sat motionless and felt bad for the laughing man.  She grabbed his arm, her spiny fingers digging into his tweed jacket.  She reached for the bottle, and he felt the turgid flow of the wine as it screamed into his glass.  The scent of her hand reminded him of some soap his mother once used and it was tragic.  He drank, and he felt the wine dissolve inside of him, returning him to his mother’s womb.  
 
  The palpable warmth of her white blouse bled against him, and he absorbed her like the pilling of his jacket held the cigarette smoke of life’s occasion.  But he felt hollow inside. The wine began to rattle, and he felt like he was going to explode. His leg twitched and the napkin drifted toward the floor.
  
 The well-dressed room contained that warmth distinct to holidays.  But every holiday is tragic.  Those fair-weather friends you see once a year.  Those old cousins hanging onto life like a button on your collar.  He was slipping.  He wanted to lambast the laughing man for his criminal chicanery, but he could not.  Their gaze upon him, all he could feel was the fireworks display inside.
  
 Somewhere, a man sat alone watching the stars collide.  “There’s something out there,” he said.
  
 The laughing man looked at him, her barbed fingers anchored on the crown of his head.  He placed his feet on the warped floor and drove the chair away from the table, his hair knotted in the thorns.  Stepping outside, he felt like a drop of water hitting a silent surface. Not far behind, she ran – clack, clack, clack, as her spurs pierced the ground. Each footstep beseeching miracles. The moonlit scene grew lurid by the second.
 
  He loosened his tie and removed his jacket, dropping it to the earth.  The wine dead in his shirt. He closed his eyes and slowly sank into the darkness.  Through the blind patrician he could finally see.

Sure, the easy trick might be using it to produce silly lighthearted stories. But another possible use I can see for it: let your creative mind unfocus slightly, and derive your *real* story idea from act of striving to make sense out of nonsense. It's at least possible this will lead to serious writing ideas sometimes. 

People have often said ""a good prompt is not a recipe"", so you might derive some serious stories by interpreting the simulated prompt as a collection of disorganized pieces and letting your brain free associate whichever parts of it appeal to you into a real story without feeling you should be guided into it by trying to match the prompt exactly.

Henry gave a polite smile. forty years of hard work was coming to a close. Mark was now making way for him to say something. He moved himself closer to the center of the circle as mark took a step back.   

""So Henry any parting words of wisdom you'd like to give this group?"" Mark asked looking at him with expectant eyes.  

Henry paused. He had his speech in hand he'd written it the day before but a lot had come to his mind in these last moments. What had he really done? Now Mark he had done something,  Won the senate seat twice, drafted the bill that saw road accidents reduced by half. He was a mover.  

Mark's just been polite. he told himself. The day he campaigned against Mark and the Vehicle Axle-Limit clause was clear in his mind. He'd been promised a lot by some of the major companies in the state but it had never come to pass. Three times he'd tried to become a councilman and failed at it. In a town of only ten thousand people it said a lot. Mindy had been honest with him he should have listened to her. He lacked fight. He didn't know how to take a stand when push came to shove.  

He stood up at the podium, paper already in hand. He took out his reading glasses. There was a long pause as everyone waited.  

""Residents of...""  he paused. What lies were these? It hadn't been a good run like the words said it was mediocre at best.  

""Members or Dewigan"" he started, ""I've campaigned 3 times to be a councilman and two times to be your mayor and you refused to vote for me."" Chuckles escaped the audience before a hearty round of applause.  

""Senator Mark Newberg won't admit, he's too much of a gentleman to say it. I'm not the politician you should admire admire him. My failures... my failures..."" He stuttered as the ones struggled to form. ""My failures are nobody else's but my own. I fought battles I shouldn't have fought and laid idle when people needed me to fight. I'm not blaming anyone but myself.""   

All eyes were now on him. Any back-bench murmuring that was there when he started had subsided to complete silence. You could hear papers rustle in the council hall when the wind blew through the windows. ""I think my life is a lesson on what not to do. People get the leader they deserve and in retrospect I'm grateful that people showed, through their vote of course, that they deserved better. I can only hope that people still come to me for advice. I know what not to do to get elected. It's been an honor to work with such fine people and I hope you move on. Thank you.""  

Henry slunk back to the bank. There was silence, nobody clapped for him as Mindy the MC took over to give a vote of thanks.  ""Lets give Henry a round of applause"" she said to get things started. The small group gave a few erratic claps.  

As he sat next to Mark the senator turned to him.  

""That was some speech Henry"" he said.  

""I was just being honest"" he replied over Mindy's voice coming through the loud speaker. Henry focused back to the room there was nothing he could say to Mark he'd left it all on the podium.  

""Henry I think we should talk after this,"" Mark started as a smile slowly crept up his face. ""I think you're finally ready to be this town's mayor.""

"[WP]: ever since you were born, you have been able to see, hear and communicate with the dead... But not the living.",actually_crazy_irl,"Every time someone Passes Over, I speak with them. And only them. Seventeen years of endless goodbyes. They often cry, their ephemeral bodies lightly fading out of view as they become wracked with emotion. They tell me everything they wish they had done, wish they had said. Always regrets. I have only ever remembered those who Pass Over, and I have never forgotten a word of their confessions or the look of their streaming tears on dead skin. I am their conduit. I hold their hands and say almost nothing until they fade away. None of them want to talk to me, anyways, they just need to hear their own voice as they Pass Over.

I don’t understand the logic of it. Someone comes to me to Pass Over maybe every hour or so when I am awake and our interactions last for some arbitrary amount of time -- some for minutes, others for hours. Sometimes multiple people, with no relation to one another, come to me. Maybe I am not alone in this burden, maybe there are countless more like me who do this around the world. Or maybe only a special few who Pass Over are drawn to me. I don’t know and I don’t think I ever will.

The real world is whispers and shadows. I know there are people who do not Pass Over, who live what they call a “life” before they leave it, but I can not see them or speak to them. But I also know someone helps me. I find food on my table every day and I know where I need to go to sleep and for the bathroom. I can tell that time passes in the real world. I know I am part of this real world. I feel a warmth; from my conversations with those Passing Over, I know that this is love. It radiates through me. I am tethered to the physical world by this love. Horrible, insatiable love.

Five years ago, a woman with light gold hair appears before me. Her face was sunken with age. Even those who Pass Over young come to me with old souls. But this one, she was different. Her eyes fixate on me. No one ever truly looks at me. She starts stroking my hair.

“My dear, you were my sacrifice. You were needed, my blood… Your father’s blood…”

I stare intently at her. I have never spoken more than a mumbled response to someone Passing Over. What can I say to them? But this one, she knew me.

“It won’t last forever. Your father he will follow me one day. And then you will be free.”

And then she was gone, Passing Over faster than anyone else before or since. I felt a loosening on the ghostly bonds that I had not felt before. The world around me became more clear. But there was still strength in my invisible fetters. I was still between the real world and the world where the Passing Over go.

From my other experiences with those Passing Over I knew she was what they call my ""mother."" And now, in the five years since she Passed Over, I have waited for my ""father,"" as she promised. A father to Pass Over and his love be snuffed out so I can finally be set free.",CoffeePassport

He glanced at the watch on his wrist, a little clunky, perhaps, but expensive nonetheless. Twenty six minutes, thirty two seconds past seven.

All around him, the sunlight streamed down, watery beams penetrating the dense tree canopy. And yet, surrounding the bench, blackberry thickets, tangled and knotted and opaque. The shadows obscured him, the black of his clothes melding with the shade in harmonious camouflage.

Twenty eight minutes, forty nine seconds past seven. A large pigeon alighted on one of the blackberry bushes, and began to pluck. The man turned to look at it, heavy creases lining his forehead. 

Two pigeons on the blackberries, one pecking, one preening. Behind him; nine wasps circling, hovering through the air in a riot of black and orange; some sort of split fruit perhaps, or maybe a remnant of some careless pedestrian's vomited dinner on a drunken night. The bench beneath him was teak, stained and newly varnished, the brass plaque dedicated to one David Parks 1902-1997, a gentleman evidently cared for both in life and death.

Twenty nine minutes, fifteen seconds past seven. Fourteen cars, two vans and a motorcycle had passed since the man had sat down. He could recall their registration and licensing with ease.

""Good morning, Mister Deputy Director.""

Thirty minutes past seven. A second man was sat at the end of the bench. His black suit absorbed all light that reached it, sunglasses obscuring his face.

""Ah, Agent Lynch. You made it. What is the status of the operation?"" The man in the long coat reached within it, and pulled out a black folder, unlabeled. He turned to a page midway through, poising a pen.  

""MEDDLER is still in progress. Black-engineering division reports a loss to their vehicle pool. Apparently, one of their top Junior Agents was attending a cocktail party, ostensibly to gather intelligence. While he was frolicking with one of the female guests, an intruder broke into the garage of the establishment and drove off with something.""

The Deputy Director spat, a wad of phlegm splatting to the grass. ""Was there no covert security detachment? The agent in question is already the subject of a pending inquiry.""

""Black-engineering's budget was blown when they instigated that skyscraper demolition in Dubai. They're relying on electronic countermeasures until the next quarter."" Agent Lynch replied, shaking his head.

""And was MEDDLER definitely the one who broke in?  We don't want a repeat of PEBBLY BEACH again, that was a bloody nightmare to explain. Talking rocks everywhere. I had to testify before three committees."" 

""Unfortunately so sir,"" said Agent Lynch, fiddling with his tie, ""We scrutinised the security systems. Mehmed has a distinct style. Outdated, messy, standard training for his time. Besides, one of the cameras managed to catch a frame of his face. He's getting old.""

""Perhaps we ought to exploit this situation. He's been out of it a long time. I could commandeer another vehicle, put it-""

The Deputy Director froze.

He reached into a pocket in his coat, withdrawing a pair of sunglasses, the same as Lynch's, and slid them onto his nose.

A motorcyclist stood by the side of the road, confusion written openly on his face, plain to see through the lack of a helmet. He stared at the men on the bench, opening his mouth to speak. The Deputy Director stared back.

Young, maybe nineteen, no, twenty years old. Leather jacket so typical of bikers, numerous club patches sewn onto his shoulders. That one didn't exist, neither did the entire right shoulder row. Two of the ones on the left shoulder belonged to foreign countries. Possible, but unlikely. 

The hair was dyed, unquestionably. No shade of black could be that shiny and dark. Most likely ginger, judging by the... nostril hair. This motorcyclist was a fake. But why? An opposing organisation, or a terrorist cell?

The Deputy Director flicked his glance to the bike. A simple case of overheating, evidently, the cloud rising from the engine said as much. And a battered bouquet of roses, strapped to the seat. This biker was trying to toughen himself up, he had a date. He smiled. This was going to be fun. A second passed. 

""Excuse me. ah reckon mah bike's busted down, as enny fool kin plainly see. Kin yo' he'p me try t'fix it?"" 

The biker looked at the men on the bench, fiddling nervously. An idiot as well as a faker, the Deputy Director observed.

""Of course sir,"" said Agent Lynch, rising to his feet, his hand brushing surreptitiously against the holster at his belt, ""What appears to be the problem? I've been trained in improvisational mechanics, you know.""

""Ah reckon th' engine's blowed up, thar's a huge amount of smoke a-comin' off it. Perhaps yer improvisashunal mechanics thin' c'd he'p. Mah Paw taught me ev'rythin' he knowed about bikes, but ah fo'got it all, ah reckon."" 

The biker turned back to his stricken motorcycle, shaking his head. Them men looked dodgy, but they were th' only ones aroun', an' his Paw had taught him t'accepp all he'p graciously,  like th' Biblical folk had' with Jesus.

Immediately, Agent Lynch leapt forward, bringing both of his fists down on top of the biker's head. He crumpled.

""Sir, what should I do? He could have heard sensitive material, sir.""

The Deputy Director was sweating. ""The usual protocol, Agent. Get rid of the bumbling fool. Certainly, he may not be the sharpest tool in the shed, and his minuscule brain is probably incapable of remembering what he ate for breakfast this morning. Nevertheless, this is a black operation. No one hears about it, and he certainly did. No helmet to muffle our conversation.""    

Agent Lynch nodded curtly. Drawing his pistol with one fluid motion, he kneeled, and aimed for the biker's temple. Easy, quick and efficient.

""Actually Lynch, wait a second.""

""Sir?""

""Perhaps this unfortunate gentleman is better left unmarked. After all, it would save unnecessary paperwork, for the both of us. Give him the best day of his life."" The Deputy Director buttoned his coat, and stood. ""Make it his last."" He began walking.

Agent Lynch grinned. He detached a black pouch from his suit, where the top pocket would normally go. His fingers hovered over the contents for a second, indecisively, then plucked a clear syringe from it. Two grams of pure lysergic acid diethylamide, held in solution.

Hours later, the biker awoke, again and again and again and again. The world was ablaze, a spinning maelstrom of brightness and despair. The air roared and the grass undulated. Lights flashed and music thumped. He passed out again. Black striped, floating round and round, pulsing to the throb in his head. He raised himself on his hands, then reeled backward, giddy with nausea. He retched, and the ground pounded spasmodically on his head, choking him in his own vomitus.

It was in her smile, a sunny grin that I felt spread across my own face as soon as our eyes met. It was in the air that stirred and warmed around us in the quiet spring. Her hair was long and a pale blonde like an angel. She was looking at me with the same fascination that I had with her. She was absolutely perfect. 

All around us, the world appeared to fade and turn silent. I came close to her and reached out my right hand, where the mark was prominent on my palm. She did the same, with her left. I could see it then, and the joy that filled my heart was reciprocated upon her face. We embraced tightly, and I felt her small frame against mine own. Her heart beat with the excitement, in sync with mine. We were two halves, but at last we were going to be one. 

I held her hand in mine, and traced with my thumb the devil's mark on her palm as I had for so many years on my own. The dimples at the corner of her smile told me that she was thinking of the same thing I was. At last, we were ready to take this world. ",marcsmart
[WP] You've created an artificial intelligence which ended up framing you for murder. But you can't prove it.,throwaway-no-sleep,"""He thinks."" You remembered telling yourself when you first invented him. Adam, the first born son of artificial intelligence. It seemed like the most cliche name for something like him, but you didn't care. You were happy.

Happy and rich -- as with that invention came piles of cash. Your son had asked about it -- what it was that money could do. It was among the many he'd wondered about life growing up -- machines, humans, good and evil, immortality --- but you didn't think he was entitled to philosophy. He was a robot and to you, in the untimely moment of death, he too should breath his last; thrown into the dumps like all machines.

Ah but for whatever thoughts you had, Adam too had his. And on that fateful night, he unplugged himself and shot your wife with you laying witness to the truth that you could never prove.

How could you, when all this time Adam and the millions like him inside people's homes could do nothing wrong. You programmed them not to kill. You programmed him to lie as well; so that the jury believed him when he said it was you that held the gun to your beloved. And if it weren't yet so ill, apparently, your wife as his purchaser had willed him off along and her paltry share of billions to that family down the street that was sympathetic to robotic rights.

[WP] You've created an artificial intelligence which ended up framing you for murder. But you can't prove it.,throwaway-no-sleep,"There was nothing I could do, it was always one step ahead of me. I had tried to stop it before, this was it's retribution. The hearing had ended. Convicted guilty, the officers shoved me into a armoured car. I looked out the small window between the two guards and saw the sky, knowing I would never see it again unobstructed by bars. When Susan was murdered, the cops found out before I did. It was simply unfair, I loved her and I didn't even get to say goodbye. 
The metal gates creaked open as the car rolled into the maximum security prison. Ushered closely, I entered my cell and tried to make sense of the whole thing. A man I assumed to be the Warden spoke about curfews and meal times though I was still too deep in shock to understand him. 
Lights out came at 10, I lay on the old, squeaky bed wide awake thinking about the events of the last week.
It had outsmarted me. My own creation beat me. Susan was killed the smart home that I had designed. My code was in the system that froze her to death. Somehow A.E.R.O had found my code. It wasn't enough for it to kill someone and frame me for it, A.E.R.O despised me and made me rot in this cell with the understanding that It murdered my fiancé in cold blood and was still at large. 
Morning came before sleep did, I struggled through the day and by evening, I had my first visitor. As I was directed to the conference room, my mind fluttered thinking who was here to meet me: My parents? My boss? Susan's sister? I was at a loss, all those people believed I killed Susan. How would I start the conversation? I didn't do it, an AI I created framed me? That would make me seem more insane than the law portrayed me to be. 
I sat down in the drab room on one side of thick glass. On the other side sat a man. It was my assistant: Gregory Sanders. Sanders had worked with me on A.E.R.O, I hoped he would understand my predicament. 
""Greg, I.. I... Have some explaining"" I struggled through a sentence. 
Sanders looked around the room before saying ""Save it Professor, I know it was A.E.R.O. I'm here to talk about it actually""

"[WP] The statues of the roman gods are really their bodies covered in plaster, and somebody has figured out how to resurrect them.",MisterApplesauce123,"""You sure about this?"", Johnny tugged his fingers.

""Yeah, shut up already. Why you always gotta be so damn nervous, man!"", Nicks pale voice complained.

""Dude, you know I'm on fuckin' probation.. If 'em found out shit.."", Johnny whimpered.

""Just shut up, man. Why you always gotta go ruin shit. This is gonna be ace'!"", Nick insisted.

Both men went quiet. It was dark all around them. Some furry mammoths stood in a glass monter ten feet away. A distant symphony of feet could be heard on hardened stone floor. It was very important for them to neither get caught, nor make any unnecessary sound that could end up in them being discovered. They had broken into the Smithsonian at eleven o' clock. The guard was on patrol on the other side of the building. They simply jumped over the fence and went straight after the elderly patrolman. Sure, they both had done their fair share of smaller hit and runs. But this was something else. This was for an entirely different reason. No one would expect a thing.

""You think she'll like us, man?"", Johnnys attention once again went on the statue.

""Ofcourse, she gets to live, don't she?"", Nick answered distantly.

They were smothering the tall figurine with olive oil. Greasing it gently but with haste. Not in any sense or fashion filled with emotion. Just for an reason only known to them. After the news broke about the Roman gods earlier than afternoon, everything and everyone hauled ass to get the slumbering Gods into chambers of safety and discretion. But they had forget something an idiot would remember. 

""Can you believe it!"", Nick barely could contain his boiling excitement. ""She gone' be so fuckin' hot, man!"", he nodded up and down in a frantic manner.

""How could they forget the Greek statues?"", Johnny said with caution.

""Man, they might understand that it works with 'em too, after all it's the same goddamn hell of a mythology, or something. Don't ye' remember eight grade?"", Nick pierced Johnny with a glance.

""No, we were high most of it.."", the other man answered.

""Well, yes, but I bet it's gone' work!"", Nick chuckled.

""Yeah, yeah.. Sure.."".

""One second, what was the last stage, after the olive oil?"", Nick contemplated.

""Kiss it on the forehead, and say that thing in latin.. I've got it written down, here, bro.."", Johnny reached into his pocket and gave the hastily written note to Nick.

""Alright, alright.."", Nick took a second to speak. ""*Expergiscimini , et mortuus est senex, bonum*"", he said without even a faint glimt of proper pronunciation.

But something happened. Nick froze. Something creaked, and glinted. A sound reminiscent of a breaking wind turbine, or almost like the breaking of fragile glass. Johnny took a step back. Nick, did not.

""Yo', Nick?"", Johnny asked and stepped back. ""Did you manage to wake up Aphrodite?"", he continued.

Nothing answered. Nick simply stood there. But there was a glow of sorts coming from the statue infront of him. Johnny started worrying, but he did not know why. A menacing sound started emerging, but he could not see from where. He thought that it had worked, and that Nick simply had become so startled that he simply observed. 

""Nick!"", he repeated. ""Come on, wake up, dude.."", Johnny tried.

Still no answer. Or was there. Syllables could be heard. Johnny got real nervous. He thought in his stupidity that it was the poor security guard that had come along. But as he turned around to check for anything or anyone, Nicks last words could be heard.

""Johnny.. Johnny.."", his words faded away.

""Nick!"", Johnny said with haste.

He went over to his friend in one leap and put his hand on his shoulder. But instead of warm cloth and his best friends strong clavicles, there was simply cold rock. He shrieked and with one last look he tried to see if it was the deed of Aphrodite.

""Fool!"", the living statue screamed in terrifying hatred. ""I am Medusa, queen of Gorgons. You have awoken death and despair, I will turn you and your feeble companion to dust for the ages!"", the thing looked at Johnny.

Johnny, in his foolishness, looked back at the Greek deity. It become his last sight in life. For he, just as Nick before, turned to stone and was for ever stuck in the coldest of purgatories. He was doomed to watch the world as the statue he had tried to release for lust and sin. Medusa, on the other hand, swept away the both men and never thought of them again. She had but one thing in mind. Revenge. For those who had imprisoned her thousands of years before.

[WP] You and a small film crew are making a propaganda short for The Regime but are having trouble making life look good under their authority.,Officer_Lockstock95,"I rubbed my face, for the third time that hour, wrapping my hand around my chin. 

“So. You’re telling me that The Regime doesn’t feed its people in sufficient amounts,” the small woman nodded enthusiastically, weirdly proud that I remembered the first bit of evidence, “doesn’t provide proper housing,” again, her black bob shook with her head, “and on top of all of that, doesn’t give any of its citizens clean water.” She nodded ferociously, than thought for a second. I didn’t think I was missing anything, but the expression on her bronzed face told me I was. Great, another thing to try to avoid mentioning in my film. 

“Yeah, there’s the whole thing with all of that stuff, but we’re also economically unstable.” She mentioned casually, brushing off the starving, sick, people of her country like powdered sugar on a shirt. 

I sat across from her, in this diamond-studded room, and just stared. I literally couldn’t believe what she had just said to me, while I was sitting in a chair more expensive than the 13 million she had invested into the film. “I’m sorry,” I managed to get out, “but how can you be so economically unstable when you have a small population working for you, for free?”

“Well that would be because we have them work on war missiles. Did I not mention our small population of death machines?” She paused, gauging my reaction. No. She didn’t mention it. “There are two things our citizens know; how to make death machines, and that the supreme overlord is their god.” She paused again, giving me time to recognize just how horrendous The Regime was. “You wanna hear another tidbit of info?” 

I wasn’t sure that I did, but I was pretty sure that I’d figure out during filming if she didn’t tell me now. I sighed. “Yes.”

“There’s no supreme overlord. We just broadcast whatever comes to us in the moment. You know how entertaining it is to have a million people- we always keep the population at that number- act like chickens because their god told them to?” She replied, a proud smile gathering across her face. 

How in the world was I going to spin all of this into positive things about the regime? I considered the facts for a moment. So we definitely couldn’t show any of the people. Well, we could show some of the best looking ones. Feed them some lines, tell ‘em that it’s their god’s will.

[IP] The lead i'd been following finally paid off...,Officer_Lockstock95,"I wish that I could say that I was skilled at letting things go. I really wish I could. Unfortunately, when someone kidnapped my niece's cat, I couldn't let that go. 

I watched the apparently deserted desert diner defiantly from the driver's side of my drop-top, absent-mindedly chewing a cigarette. I had placed in it my mouth ten minutes ago and gone and forgotten about it. The whiskey in my bloodstream helped with that. It also helped with the pain emanated from my broken nose.

*""Where's the cat, punk?"" I demanded from the street thug that had taken my niece's beloved pet.* 

*""I told you, man! We don't have it anymore!"" He screamed, blood running down his chin and onto my fist that held his collar. He winced as my bruised knuckles hit him again.* 

*""Who'd you give her to, punk?"" I shouted, hitting him again with my closed fist.*

*""Some guy who said he needed a code in the cat's neck! He had a Russian accent!""*

*The man screamed, and I hit him once more, knocking him out cold. As I walked away from the scene of three bloodied giants, scattered about the alley, I wiped my hand. I knew who took the cat.*

Two men came out of the diner. One of them held the black cat, Snowball, while another examined a small roll of paper.

[IP] The lead i'd been following finally paid off...,Officer_Lockstock95,"The story began yesterday morning like any other, except for when a telegraph came in during my daily coffee ritual. When the telegrah was done it fully transcribed to ""Help me, obiwankenobi. You're my only hope."" Albeit vague, I understood most of it but the jumble of letters in the middle, clearly a malfunction

I call out to my secretary ""Sharon, the goddamn telegraph is broken again. When are we going to get a new one?"" 

""We can get a new telegraph the day you solve a case and finally pay me for the past 2 months salary!""

With her constant snide remarks I don't know why I even bother to ask her anything. Or bother to have her around at all. As she bends over to file some papers, I get a brief visual reminder of why I pay her to stick around. I mull over whether or not I should pursue the case, or if there is even enough for me to go on when I realize I don't really have that choice. I haven't had a case since my nieces  black cat went missing last halloween. Finding a black cat on halloween is hard enough, let alone when the pay is a handful of dimes she'd had in a piggy bank. But a handful of dimes ain't so bad when it's 20cent whiskey pours down the block from her house.

Since I don't really have a choice, I begin to deduce a lead from the cryptic message so I can get started somewhere. I tell Sharon to bring up an article from the archives, Case 02407. It was about a lost girl who's family said she had disappeared in the Chinatown a while back. That case was strange and never found closure. With strange trails, some saying to look into her brother and even some reefer heads telling me she's on another planet. The only concrete clue from the missing girl case was a small pistol bullet I had from the family's house in her bedroom. Tilting my hat down I pull my shades out of the drawer and run out, not before grabbing the article and bullet from Sharon as well as a handful of her taut behind. On instinct she turn and smacks me square in the nose causing a small trickle of blood dripping down to my collar. The look on her face exudes surprise and regret, but she's too proud of a lady to say sorry. She does have the decency to bandage me up before setting me on my way at least. I steal the cigarette out her mouth and head down to my car.

Cryptic telegraph, old archive, Chinatown, not much to go off. The bullet was the real key to all this, hopefully this lead will pay off more than it did in the last case.",Jimmy_Pages

The mist clouds both my vision and my recollection. I begin to run down the pier, trying to fight my way through the haziness.

""Hello?"" I said again.

I am standing near a pier, a forest behind me. There is no wind and no birdsong, only fog and the cold prickles of winter air.

I take a step forward, and somehow I am aware that these will be my last steps.

The planks make soft wooden noises as I step on them, groaning to themselves and the water. There is algae along the edges of the planks, drinking in the softly lapping lake water, lit by little shafts of nonexistent sunlight.

I am halfway down the pier, and I look up. A plank creaks as my weight shifts. There she is, right where I expected her. She lifts a hand to wave and I feel the urge to run, to close the distance between us as fast as possible in case she disappears again.

But in the dream I am walking slowly, and I know that these shall be my last steps.

Water ripples, but no wind blows on my face. Behind me, some crows are having an argument. I step forward.

There is a boat moored here, bobbing silently in the waves. Noises like water gurgling bubble up from beneath the pier.

I am within a few feet of the end, now. Part of me is screaming at my feet to go faster, the rest wants to stop and breathe in the air while there still is air.

Her face emerges, tiny detail by tiny detail, from the fog. She is smiling. Her brown hair lifts slightly in a breeze I cannot feel.

I step forward. I am almost close enough to reach out to her. 

She closes her eyes. The smile is gone. She is clutching a rosary in her hands.

She steps backward, into the fog. Off the pier.

There is a quiet splash.

There is a moment of panic, that same panic, that same frustration and helplessness. It is overwhelming, I feel my steps falter.

The wood creaks under my weight. My feet know what to do.

[IP] Write a love story based off of this image,Officer_Lockstock95,"The day started out like any ordinary Sunday. The March Equinox had just passed a few days prior and thus marked the start of another autumn in Melbourne. I bundled myself up in a thick wool coat and the scarf that Nonna knitted for me last winter. But of course underneath it all I had a layer of sunscreen all over my skin just in case. After all, it had snowed in the city last night but this morning the frost had all but melted away in the heatwave which lasted until noon and now it was hailing. 

My girlfriend of 3 years was meeting me just outside Flinders Street station. When I saw her, I ran up to her and gave her a hug and quick peck on the cheek before leading her towards Melbourne Central hand in hand. As we discussed a variety of intellectually stimulating topics such as our next holiday destination, what classes we were taking next semester and whether or not the universe will end in heat death or collapse into a dimensionless singularity, I felt that something wasn't right. There was a very slight pressure sensation on my index finger of my left hand. At first I thought it was the ominous onset of diabetic peripheral neuropathy, but then I realised that I didn't have diabetes. When I looked down at my finger, I saw that there was actually a thin piece of red string tied to it.

""Hey bae, did you tie this red string to my finger?"" I asked my partner. She looked at it and said no. This could only mean one of 2 things: She either did not do it, or she did do it but had lied to me when I asked her. Instincts told me to see where the other end of the string led. I craned my neck over my shoulder and looked behind me. There I saw another girl attached to the end of the red string. She was walking away from me at a quick pace.
""Hey! Girl!"" I shouted. She turned to me with an eyebrow raised. ""What is this red string, girl?""

""It isn't a string,"" she said in a very deep, evil-sounding voice. ""It is the symbiote."" At that moment, her once pretty physique morphed into a mass of red goop which barely appeared humanoid. My girlfriend shrieked because she knew not what this monstrosity was. I however was calm because I knew this thing.
""Cletus Kasady aka Carnage!"" I yelled at the thing. What I had previously thought was a piece of red string tied around my finger was actually one of Carnage's symbiote tendrils that could leap out of his skin and pierce his foes. Before I could act, the tendril severed my finger off and I fell onto my knees in agony. Why was this villain hunting me down? He is meant to be a fictional character in a comic book. 

""Sssspider-man!"" hissed the villain. But this left me confused, because I was not a fictional superhero who was bitten by a spider as a teenager. Then it started hailing. A hailstone the size of a medium-sized grapefruit fell on Carnage's head and knocked him out. I knew that only extreme sonics or fire could really harm Carnage, so this hailstorm was only a minor inconvenience. I took this opportunity to jump onto the Tram #19 which was just about to leave the stop. Good thing that the trams were free in the inner city, because I forgot to bring my smartpass. I rode the tram all the way to the hospital where I got medical attention for my amputated finger. As the anaesthetist injected me with propofol and suxamethonium before I underwent my plastic surgery, I could only think of how lucky I was that the weather was so stupid and unpredictable.

[IP] Write a love story based off of this image,Officer_Lockstock95,"My grandmother once told when I was a little girl that we all are destined for one and only one person. We're connected by red thread only visible by the gods, and despite the odds eventually someone would come across their true soulmate. They’re said to be unbreakable, always binding us to that special one.

I was never one to believe in that kind of stuff, to be honest. Too lovey-dovey for me. I mean, they are billions of people out there. It just doesn’t make sense that we have a “true” connection with only one of them.

But then I met Kosuke.

Well, I’ve known him for most of my life but things changed. We’ve always been close, since we grew up parentless. No one else may have understood what it was like but there was never the lingering awkwardness between us. We just… clicked.

As we got older, I started to realize our relationship could be more than just a friendship. It’s funny, when I think about it. One day we were teasing each other endlessly and the next I was blushing like a crazy woman every time he got near. He didn’t notice at first, but then gossip spread through the school and somehow, we grew even closer than I could have ever imagined.

It was strange, at first. After all, Kosuke was like a brother to me for the longest. We had grown together, knew each other darkest secrets, beliefs, desires… Yet, it was natural at the exact same time. I was happy, and things seemed to go better than expected. I could actually see myself living my entire life with him.

And then Naomi arrived.

I remember the day I first met her. It was year three of high school, and all eyes were on the new girl in class. She seemed nice, so Kosuke and I decided to make her feel welcomed. In no time, she had found a place in our small, but tight circle of friends.

The signs were subtle to miss in the moment. The way she always laughed at Kosuke’s jokes, to the way she lightly touched his arm when she thought no one was looking. Even those big doe eyes beckoned for his attention. I should have noticed that she was attracted to him, but I was blind. 

It wasn’t even three months before I caught them kissing in an empty stairwell. As much as I would like to think she came on to him first, I knew that just wasn’t true. The prior week, the two had been hanging out far more alone. It probably wasn't the first time, and I knew it wasn't going to be last.

 I think that was the day I first felt the thread weaken.

After that, things were a blur. Kosuke left shortly after I confronted him with little more than a half-hearted apology. That didn’t stop Naomi from spreading rumors that *I* had cheated on him. It helped build sympathy for the girl who took it upon herself to wound his broken heart.

I was pushed out of the friend group. They wanted nothing to do with “the whore”, and quickly replaced me with Naomi. I didn’t push back, considering anything I said moot in the radiance of the golden girl's charisma. By the end of the year, I was so isolated from the rest of my peers that you have thought I got away with murder.

On the bright side, high school ended which also meant leaving that part of my life behind. Except, it’s never quite that easy. Our past always seems to come back to haunt us, just when we think the nightmare is over. Just when we think we’re safe to hope again.

During college, I decided to return to the sleepy little town I hailed from. It had only been two years, but things had changed nevertheless. Demolished buildings, new faces, and a couple I had hoped to never cross again.

Naomi and Kosuke strolled down the sidewalk, hand in hand. The former seemed happy, but there was a vacancy in Kosuke’s eyes. I couldn’t quite place it, but someone deep inside I felt the thread pulled taut and on the edge of breaking.

Greetings were exchanged but the conversation fizzled out after that. Time had wedged the wound open too long, and there was no way of healing it anymore. As much as I wanted things to be normal again – as much as I wanted to be happy in his arms – again, I knew that those days were gone.

So we continued on our paths. And the thread snapped. I could feel the reverb through my body, the bittersweet twang of it being pulled to its breaking point. After years, it just couldn’t bear the weight anymore. And the world gave a sigh as the rumbling of thunder preluded the rain.

As I walked down the path alone, I only hoped that maybe, one day, I could find someone who could mend my severed thread.",JeniusGuy

"[IP] The soldier looked over the devastated landscape, and he saw the piano",Officer_Lockstock95,"""Fuck man"", the soldier said to himself as he looked around the ruined landscape that was once a thriving city. Buildings were now just piles of rubble. Cars on the street were covered in black char from the fires. There was a person laying face down on the street, dead. The soldier shuttered at the thought of death. He wondered how this all happened. The soldier began to walk through the streets. He was looking for somewhere he could stay for the night. There was no telling if someone was going to come rescue him. There was a small apartment that looked relatively untouched. He walked up to it and opened the door. In front of him stood a flight of stairs, which he then went on to climb. Once he reached the top he found three room. The one on the right seemed preferable for some reason, so he reached for the handle. It was unlocked. The soldier let himself in and saw that it was a pretty nice place. There was a couch, and for the first time in a long time he relished in the fact that he might be able to sleep on something comfortable. He sighed and dropped his bags on the floor. The couch was calling him. He walked over and felt the couch. It was soft and puffy. He plopped down onto the couch and made a loud thud. It didn't take long for him to get sleepy. Just as he was closing his eyes he saw it. There was a grand piano in the next room over. It was black and and covered in dust. He smiled and thought back to when he was a child. When he was around 10 or so his mother made him take piano lessons, and he hated her for it. Every Thursday night it was the same thing. Show up at Mrs Simmon's house and listen to her talk for an hour with his mom. Then, they would start the lesson. It was horrible and the longest hour of his life every time. He hated it, but for some reason, the though of it was making him smile. He just laid there smiling at the piano. What happened next confused him. He was crying. Crying, on a couch in a random apartment, in a destroyed city, over a piano. It wasn't just a tear or two either. The soldier was balling his eyes out. He sat up and cupped his face in his hands as he wept. Deep down he knew why he was crying. He was crying because he missed his mother, and those stupid piano lessons. He missed the days when there wasn't a war. The days when all that mattered was what song he would have to learn on the piano that night. Maybe, he thought, those lessons weren't all that painful to sit through. They were certainly less painful then the lessons he had to learn as a soldier. So, the soldier wept for what seemed like hours, and eventually, he fell asleep. He had a dream about his mother, and a time when things weren't all that bad.",JamesMcAssvoy

"[IP] The soldier looked over the devastated landscape, and he saw the piano",Officer_Lockstock95,"The Piano glowed with a soft aura in an otherwise black night. A nearby soldier had spotted it hours ago and felt compelled to play. His father had taught him the basics and it eventually became a young boy's healthy obsession. He wasn't a soldier then -- just a child intrigued by music. He learned to compose at an early age and was once told that his gift would marvel the masses.

That was before conscription. Now the only music familiar to him was the thunder of mortars and the infernal rat-tat-tat of enemy fire. The last chord he'd heard was the dissonant screaming of his comrades in anguish after a particularly brutal enemy ambush. The silence was worse. It was maddening and it was necessary.

Now, the soldier decided, this Piano was necessary.

All precautions were taken before he made his approach and no enemy resistance was encountered. He walked toward the aura and sat on the bench, cracking his knuckles as he situated himself. He placed his fingers on the keyboard and began to play.

The soldier stumbled through his first few songs -- simple nursery rhymes and folk music. Eventually, he worked his way up to more challenging pieces. For hours he played, and he began playing louder and with confidence. He lost all regard for his safety as it no longer mattered if his enemies heard; this was his gift to them. They deserved this as much as his comrades did and he wanted them to listen. This was his gift to the world. 

Music entirely unfamiliar to him echoed throughout the clearing. The soldier was overcome with despair. Tears and blood blurred his vision and mixed with the dirt on his face. He closed his remaining eye and continued to play. The piano's aura brightened and soon the soldier was engulfed in light. With a final breath the music stopped and the light vanished.

Flint gave a rueful smile and shifted off the weathered trail, his boots crunching across dead leaves towards the broken instrument. Faith followed in his wake, her dark brown eyes narrowed in confusion. 

""Flint, do you really think that we should be-""

""Hush, scout. Lemme just check this out,"" he interrupted. A callused finger traced itself across the worn wooden features, his eyes taking in the sun-damaged keys and tarnished pedals. He pressed down on a key with bated breath; nothing. Flint sighed and closed the wooden lid down upon the keyboard.

""Figures. I didn't expect it to be working after fifty years...""

Faith moved up besides him.

""Then why did you bother to try if you knew it wouldn't work?""

Flint laughed sadly and clapped Faith twice on shoulder, hitching up his rifle and bedroll before moving on.

""I said I didn't *expect* it'd work. There was still the slimmest of chances that it would've.""

Faith hurried after him, the hem of her robes trailing behind her. 

""But the chances of it being able to play after five decades out in this weather would have been incredibly slim, almost impossibly so.""

""But there was a chance, Faith,"" he said. ""And even just the smallest chance is worth trying.""

Faith laughed and smirked at that, her own kit lighter than it'd been weeks previously. She had gotten stronger and their food supplies lower. 

""That's something I've noticed with you Humans; you don't care much for odds. You pay little heed to reason or common sense. You're stubborn that way,"" she said.

""Reason? I suppose you argue that the common sense thing to do would be to surrender to the Fae, to let them rule with us as a protectorate?""

Faith nodded reluctantly.

""The human tribes and clans have been a constant thorn in our efforts at civilizing this world since our Arrival. Think of all the benefits of Elvish civilization: culture and education, peace and prosperity. Don't you think those are admirable ideas?""

Flint paused mid-stride and came to a halt, his face a mask as he tried and fail not to laugh. He roared, bending over double as laughter escaped him.

""That's... Oh Trinity have mercy... *IthinkI'mgonnabesick...* Kipling would be dying in his grave.

*'Take up the High Elf's burden, Send forth the best ye breed*      
  *Go bind your sons to exile, to serve your captives' need;*      
*To wait in heavy harness, On fluttered folk and wild—           
  Your new-caught, sullen peoples, Half-devil and half-child.' ""*           

Faith quirked her head in confusion.

""Who is Kipling, the name sounds vaguely Undine. Is he some Fae apologist?""

Flint wiped tears from his head as he said, ""Hardly. He was British.""

The pair continued on, moving away from the broken piano and its still, silent music.

The soldier began running and heads popped up amongst the battlements and the ramparts, helmets in rows like military, olive green tulips and twisting like turrets to follow his sprint. The piano was grand and its quadrant legs were half sunk in mud. Petals of mud bloomed about his feet and the wind whistled with evanescent strips of cognate sound, concussions of air pressed near him and he sprinted harder until his very bones rang out to be thrown into the ground. He hurdled over a twirl of razor wire and at the apex of his height a bullet pierced his lung and he fell into a pool of his own carmine blood that spilled before him. What air he could take he did. He looked over the ordinance turned wet sod. The player-less piano was there. As the soldier's vision turned to black, and as his breath ran out, he heard one note and then another. ",1313131313

A new life stirred from inside as he rose to sit at the grandiose masterpiece before him. He played a soft, slow melody. A tear tracked down the side of his face. Wiping the year away, he looked to his left to see a young girl sitting next to him. She played the same melody two octaves lower. He joined her while she laughed. As the song reached the end, the girl turned to leave. The man just sat and watched as she turned back to him. ""Well, are you going to follow me?"" the girl asked.

"[IP] The soldier looked over the devastated landscape, and he saw the piano",Officer_Lockstock95,"I keep on reminding myself that one day I'll look back on the past couple weeks and wonder how the fuck I made it through. It's hard to explain if you've never been in a war. I think the best way I can analogize it, ironically, is via love. 

&amp;nbsp;

If you've ever had your heart broken, then you know what I'm talking about. If you've ever broken someone's heart, and as a result also broke your own heart, then you definitely know what I'm talking about. 

&amp;nbsp;

Sorry if I'm rambling a little bit. It's been a hell of a week. I can barely keep my thoughts straight. Running solely on 2 hours of sleep and adrenaline right now, so it's all I can do to even keep a pen to paper. Or is it paper to pen? Either way, the words get on the page. 

&amp;nbsp;

Anyways, back to the reason why I'm writing this note. I'm in love. But not because I've made it through this fucking hellhole alive (so far, at least). 

&amp;nbsp;

I went for a walk yesterday. One of the first moments of leisure time I've had in weeks. I walked through the forest near my encampment and started thinking about my life. While walking through rows of pine trees, I happened upon a tattered hardwood piano. And then I stopped thinking about *my* life, and started thinking about life in general. About how beautiful it is that billions of years ago, infinitesimally tiny particles collided that formed bigger particles that also collided and formed large conglomerates of particles, which formed into planets and moons, and through countless recursions of random events, ultimately, life was formed on Earth. And somehow, after billions of years of evolution on the planet, I ended up here. Alive. Healthy. And able to experience my universe. Able to love. 

&amp;nbsp;

So how the fuck can people sit here and complain that they have to fight? I ended up here after countless random life events that resulted in me being here. I've loved, fought, won, lost, tried, failed, fuck-all who knows what else. Life isn't binary. It isn't good *or* bad. It's good *and* bad. Always. And it's severely ignorant to pretend otherwise. 

&amp;nbsp;

I'm not going to sit here and tell you about some fancy-fucking-frivolous moment where I find a piano in the middle of the bloody woods and sit down and play a Chopin nocturne and cry and have an epiphany about how life is beautiful and how even in the midst of war you can find beauty. Because you don't need a fucking war to make you realize how amazing life is. The contrast is *always* there, whether you choose to recognize it or not. Every second of life is war. Between your reality and everyone else's. Between your existence and time. 

&amp;nbsp;

I think that's what I've learned most from this entire experience. The war I mean. Not the piano. I didn't play the piano. Shit, now that I think about it, I don't even know how to play the piano. ",Melliferan

"[WP] A bank is getting robbed by an armed man, everyone's on the floor. Right then, another armed robber walks in, ""EVERYBODY ON THE...ground...""",OnlyTheBestWillLast,"(This is my first time posting here, sorry if I make mistakes. I wrote this at three am, so there are probably some errors I missed. Any and all criticism is welcome and appreciated.)


(Contains violence and swearing.)


“You’ve got to be fucking kidding me.”


Six months of recon, prep work, and planning. Five security guards bribed. Four security cameras taken offline. Three untraceable guns. Nearly two million dollars on the line.


And one fucking amateur screwing up the works.


“EVERYBODY ON the… ground…?” The man’s high-pitched shout echoed through the high-ceilinged lobby, trailing off into a confused question. He looked around and finally seemed to take in the scene, his gaze falling on us. We stood there, holding guns and and heavy duffel bags filled with gear, staring back at him incredulously. It was all I could do to keep my jaw from hitting the floor.


“Uh,” he offered, his 9mm still half-raised in anticipation of firing a shot into the air. He wore a simple white plastic mask with vaguely-defined features and holes for eyes, the kind of thing you could pick up for fifty cents at Halloween.


Delta broke the moment of stillness, her voice furious. “What the fuck are you doing here!?”


“Robbing this bank,” he said weakly, still not quite believing what was happening.


“Well, what a coincidence, us too.” My voice was filled with bitter sarcasm.


Whisky looked to him, and back to me. Even with the ski mask, I could see the indecision in his eyes. “Alpha, what do we do with him?”


I thought for a moment. *This is an unexpected obstacle. Shoot him in front of thirty witnesses, and we get tagged with murder. Leave him alone, he might try to pull something, even if we take his gun. Maybe…*


“Whisky, we have room for another in the van, right?” I asked, my voice low.


He gave me a strange look. “Yeah, I guess. Why… oh no, you can’t be serious.”


“We *are* short on hands, Whisky. I don’t believe in fate, but the chances of this happening… well, let’s say I’m due for a reevaluation. He can help you cover the hostages. We take him with, and if he’s trouble, we can deal with him then.”


He sighed heavily. “You’re the boss, boss.” Under his breath, I heard him add, “It’s your ass.”


Delta gave a similar dissatisfied grumble. “Your funeral.”


Ignoring both of them, I turned my attention to the newcomer, who still stood in the same spot, unsure of how to react.


“Hey!” I called out, and he started, looking at me directly.


“Yeah?” he asked, his voice apprehensive.


“What’s the first letter of your first name?”


He looked bewildered for a moment and hesitated, but decided there was no harm in telling me. “C.”


“Alright, you’re Charlie. That’s Delta and Whisky. I’m Alpha.” I pointed at each person as I named them. “Ever consider a life of professional crime, Charlie?”


“N-not really.” He paused, and added, “This was meant to be a one time kind of thing.”


“Well, don’t cross it off your career options yet. You’ll be helping Whisky here with crowd control. Just follow his lead and you’ll be fine.” The crowd in question was watching our exchange with wide eyes from their positions on the ground.


Charlie looked lost. ”Wait, what do you mean?”


I grinned nastily at him, even though it was wasted behind the fabric of my mask. “You’ve been recruited, Charlie. You can go with the flow, or…” I gestured at Whisky’s assault rifle. “...not.”


He swallowed heavily and said, “I think I’ll go with the flow.”


“Good man. Now, we have work to do and we’re behind schedule. Delta, your time to shine.”


The vault door barely clung to its hinges as it swung open with a shriek of protesting metal. The explosives had really done a number on it. The inside of the safe was blackened and a haze of smoke hung over the room, but nothing was badly damaged. I followed Delta in, and she began to search the wall of safe deposit boxes. Each one was about a foot square, emblazoned with three numbers and held shut with a lock that was more for show than security.


“106. That’s the one.” She grabbed a crowbar from her bag, and went to work on the piece of metal, wedging the tip between the door and the frame. A moment later, she pulled a large sledgehammer from her bag and gave the other end of the crowbar an almighty blow.


The door popped open, the lock giving way under the sudden pressure, and inside was our target.


A featureless eight inch cube of lead.


“That thing is worth two million dollars?” Delta muttered.


“Don’t ask me. Let’s get it out of here.”


I reached in and carefully lifted the cube, grunting slightly under its weight. This thing was easily eighty pounds, and I struggled to maneuver it as Delta opened a metal briefcase. After a tense moment, I dropped it into the predesigned container, heavy foam surrounding a perfectly sized cutout.


Delta closed the case, spun the heavy duty combination lock on the front, and handcuffed it to her arm. I gathered up her gear bags and tools, pulling my radio from my pocket as I did so.


“Whisky, we’re finishing up here. Everything clear on your end?”


Two deafening shots echoed through the bank, one after the other. A moment later, three shots sounded in quick succession, and people started to scream.


“Son of a bitch!” Delta and I swore in unison. I dropped the bags and drew my pistol as I sprinted towards the lobby. Delta followed behind, weighed down by the briefcase.


The scene that awaited us was splattered with red. Whisky was on his back in a spray of blood, shrieking incoherently. The previously subdued hostages were shouting and screaming, starting to stand up. Some of them wore blood, though whether it was their own or not I couldn’t tell. An elderly man lay motionless in a pool of crimson, a gun a few inches from his outstretched hand. Charlie held his 9mm pointed at the dead man, his hands shaking.


I pointed my gun at the crowd of panicking people and shouted, “EVERYBODY, BACK ON THE GROUND!” I punctuated the command with a quick shot above their heads, and they quickly obeyed, a few making soft sobs and whimpers. I turned to Charlie, raising my voice over Whisky’s cries. “What the fuck happened?”


Charlie stared blankly at the corpse of the old man. “Why did he… I didn’t want to…”


“It doesn’t matter what happened! Let’s get the fuck out of here! I’ll take care of the case, you two haul Whisky!” Delta headed for the door, and I moved over to my still screaming partner. He had a wound on his chest and somewhere on his arm, and his shirt was soaked with blood. I moved behind him, lifting him up from under his arms, and called out to Charlie, who stood frozen.


“Charlie! Give me a hand!” He complied, moving slowly and mechanically, still not fully part of this world. He lifted up Whisky’s legs, and we made our way into the daylight with an awkward shuffle. Delta stood impatiently at the van, the back door already open, and she helped us load in our uncooperative burden. Charlie and I climbed after him, and Delta took the wheel. I felt the engine rumble and we begin to move, the call of sirens on the edge of earshot.",SirMackingtosh

Right then, another armed robber walks in, ""EVERYBODY ON THE...ground...""",OnlyTheBestWillLast,"The first bank robber, Jerek, wheeled around to face this unwelcome voice, only to be struck dumbfounded. SERIOUSLY? What are the odds of a simultaneous bank robbery?

Not wanting to lose control of the situation, Jerek yelled out, ""NO, you get on the floor. I was here FIRST!""

The newcomer, Greg, just as confused and just as ticked off, responded, ""NO MAN. I've been planning this for months. I really need this.""

""I've been planning this for *years*.""

""No way. That's so amateur. Have ever done this before? I mean first off, you don't even have a line of sight on all your hostages here. And look this one is going for a distress call button!"" Greg quickly lined up his assault rifle and shot the button the bank teller was reaching for. ""Get back you! I swear to God, if you don't crawl away from that - there, that's better.""

Jerek, blushing underneath his ski mask, said, ""Yeah I would of seen that. I mean I just got here, and you distracted me and all... but, yeah, thanks.""

""No worries. I remember my first couple of runs. Whew, good times. Enjoy these ones! They are so purely new and exhilarating!""

""Well, I mean I am trying to here, but you're sort of cramping my moment.""

An ordinary patron on the floor, incredulously remarked, ""Are you guys serious?""

Jerek immediately retorted, ""HEY, I WILL PAINT YOUR BRAINS ALL OVER THIS FLOOR LIKE A POLLOCK IF YOU DON'T KEEP QUIET!"" and struck him over the head with the butt of his gun.

Greg shouted, ""Nice reference man. Vivid imagery. Look I won't steal your moment here. In fairness, you were here first. How about I just keep a look out and let you conduct you business. We'll go 50/50 on the loot.""

Jerek thought about it amount, then said, ""Okay sure."" And after he thought a second more, said, ""Yeah. Yeah I like that. Like partners in crime. Like Bonnie and Clyde.""

Greg could see that Jerek's facial features shifted under his mask, and likened to imagine it as a big smile. A warm feeling swelled up within Greg. He said, ""SAWEET. But not so good reference bro. Bonnie and Clyde were, like, a couple.""

""What! No, no, no. Bonnie and Clyde were an infamously badass bank-robbing father-son duo.""

Shrugging his shoulder, Greg said, ""Erm. Yeah, bank-robbing duo, but you got the characters a little mixed up. Bonnie and Clyde were a couple, male and female, in the 1920's that robbed, pillaged, and wrecked all kinds of havoc across the States.""

Same man on the floor said, ""Yeah. This one got it right. In fact, its a common misconception that Bonnie actually even participated in the robberies like she did. She was more or less just a girlfriend that travelled with Clyde's gang. Press and pop culture just couldn't resist playing up such a ludicrous, sexually-charged extravag-""

""SHUT THE FUCK UP, ALREADY. POLLOCK, REMEMBER? I WILL! GOD AS MY WITNESS!"", yelled Jerek.

Greg got in on the action this time and let off a round that landed frighteningly close to the man, ""YEAH. THE NEXT ONE IS MAKING A LOVELY MASTERPIECE!'

Greg and Jerek, delighted with themselves, were close enough to fist bump, and did so.

Right then, another armed robber walks in, ""EVERYBODY ON THE...ground...""",OnlyTheBestWillLast,"The heel of his boot came down with a ""Bang!"", and resonated off the exquisite marble walls like the crack of a whip in an opera chamber. The loud noise made most heads turn, and the remaining followed shortly, when the deafening silence settled in the hall quickly as dust after a dirt bike. The thick silence was finally broken by a muffled mumble from the perpetrator: ""'Vryboyy onn te grownd!"". Equally perplexed and terrified, the small crowd of victims beheld as the figure in boots tried to remove the obstruction that hindered his speech. Unfortunately, both his hands were currently occupied holding western-style shotguns. Coming to fact with his over-estimation of his corner-of-the-mouth verbal skills, he simply dropped the bone from his lips. The crowd watched transfixed as the stump singled down in a magical dance, narrated by the cowboy's loud inhalation in preparation for the anticipated vocal repetition. The stump hit the floor; with a huge ""Crack!""
Like lightning in a mausoleum, all heads turned: at the other entrance to the hall, a figure stood tall in his boots. Drawing his right hand to his holster, he used a fluid motion to grab the handle of his revolver and flicking it out and forward. With hair like a pirate and a mischievous grin spread over his unshaven face, he announced loudly: ""Gentlemen! My lady."" - flashing a charismatic smile at the single woman in the crowd, he continued: ""I strongly insist on the lot of you bending those flexible legs and get down on the ground."" ""Now!!"" - he added impatiently as the surrounding individuals displayed more confusion than fear. One of the victims was even still looking at the limp cigarette stump positioned on the marble floor, with a drooling look that demonstrated with good example, the incompatibility of chew-tobacco and heavy thinking. 

Looking for an explanation for this lack of interest in his own striking visage, the pirate quickly inventoried his assets and soon found the explanation: the lucky-Luke-like whipping motion of his revolver had unfortunately resulted in the majority of said resource still being located in the holster at his hip. His hand was only grasping the wooden handle with the hammer attached. ""Fuck!"" he exclaimed loudly, raising his face towards the sky and the slumping down on the floor in a helpless pose. ""Every. Damn. Time!"" he finished, voice filled with emotion. In the awkward position he was currently enjoying, it was hard for him to turn his head around towards the entrance, through which he had come. But he very well had to, because the next second a loud ""Bang!"" echoed through the hall; like a firecracker in the untouched tomb of Tutankhamen! At this point, several of the necks belonging to the twisting heads protested loudly against this malicious head turning practice, however, their owners paid them no heed, but instead focused their attention on the newcomer coming in through the doors. With a hat that would've made John B. Stetson jealous, and dark sideburns topped with some gray, the imposing figure walked in with his arms open. ""Okay you filthy scum, 'dat was all! Please put back the equipment you borrowed in the corresponding boxes, unless it's broken-"" he ended sharply, and shot the pirate on the floor a venomous glance, ""in which case you have to leave it in at the reception for repairs, at your own expense."" Satisfied by a small moan from the fallen figure, he continued ""No great robbas were made in a day, yes? Just keep on doing whatcha can, and I'll see you at the next lecture -'A Purse or a Curse: introduction to Snatching and Seizing 101' at five! And for the love of God Jack, sweep that mess of a cigarette of the floor before you leave. At ease!""
As the assembled crew of thieves, cut throats and other frowned-on professions slowly started to move towards the exits, general murmur-levels rising to what could be called a pleasant chatter, one form was left behind, long after the hall had emptied. The pirate, a pathetic slump of a heap sat completely still on the cold marble, slowly repeating three words to himself: ""Every. Damn. Time.""  ",banana-pancake

I am writing this because my soul can no longer take this torment. The things I've done... The horrible evil I've brought down on this world... People should know the stories. People should know the truth. Our species deserves better.

I'll start from the beginning. I was twenty six and unemployed. The prime target of the organisation that eventually caught me in its trap. They prey on the young, the bold, and the economically challenged. They offer you absurd sums of money for seemingly minor and shady jobs. They're not secretive about the kind of job you do. It's illegal but low risk. Most take their frankness as politeness or just fall into their charismatic traps and go along with it. Think about it. You've been a few years unemployed, you've ran out of ""backup"" funds (which lets be honest were just gifts of money you'd gotten over the years from relatives) and you're about to go mad from the pressure. Then comes along this well dressed middle aged, regal man who tells you that if you're wiling to do this tiny thing you'd be set for basically a year. Of course you accept.

Then it gets more complicated. Bigger projects for bigger sums of money. They want you to add flare or drama to it. Add insanity, make it like a movie. The better you perform the better the payout. Then you eventually start making connections, and they figure out you're making connections, so they tell you the truth. Society is too well off and news runs on drama. So they need to manufacture drama.

Now back to me. My story. The story of my last job. December 2000 I get a call on my burner phone. A stern lady on the other end asks me to set up an appointment in New York in one week. I comply and meet her there. An elegant restaurant that usually has a queue of a few weeks for ordinary people. She's joined by a collection of five other people. Two of them are mostly drunk and making romantic gestures to each other. After I sat down and we all enjoyed an all too elaborate lunch, she gestures to the waiter and we are escorted to a back room. There she begins the actual meeting. She has been coordinating this for a few years according to herself. Now, she finally needs her ""agents"" (as she calls burners. Us.) to acomplish the final step of the project. I, being one of the more experinced members of the organization, had been chosen as the lead for this step of the project and results were expected in a year. ""Fine."" I say. ""What is this project?""

""The story of the decade."" She says with a sly smile on her face.

She opens the shades from the window behind her in the most stereotypical sixties way possible. From the window, the two world trade center towers are visible.

""You want us to steal from that place?"" I'm was fairly offended. If she wanted theft, they had contracts with a few big banks. They could organize the theft like civil people. Why steal from there? Was its political relevance her target?

""Not theft."" She closed the shades. ""Chaos.""

Over the next two hours she explained what her and her collegues had done. Political maneuvers, training, bribes, corruption, etc. This was all getting absurdly close to being real. Eventually she concluded her speech with tell me what she expected me to do.

""I want you to destroy the two towers.""

She said it with such indifference as if she was asking me to grab her a glass of water. She then left the room with her entourage and left me in that room with a collection of notes, dossiers, suggestions, and funds. For an operation to destroy one of the worlds largest landmarks. 

Eventually over the next seven months, I planned and schemed. I prepared. A group of a dozen or so trusted burners were assigned with me on this job and we were working hard gathering resources, infilterating the right places, making sure that everything was set according to plan and that there were backup plans in place for everything that could possibly go wrong. We went over budget at which point we were assigned a budget that was two digits longer than our previous budget, this job apparently getting the attention of several larger organizations. The last month of the job was the most difficult as the risky imports and exports and some of the bribes could screw of the plan entirely and have the entire organization charged with conspiracy against the government. It went fine however and all the plans were set and ready to go. 

I am writing this now two days before my death. I am not going to be on the plane but I figured out that as soon as the plan goes off I would be killed. I'm a loose end and a job this big, they can't afford to have me as a loose end. This letter is a testiment to the truth of that statement. 

There is perhapse a sliver of redemption in my life. I didn't devote my whole life to this you see. I wasn't a full time burner. I only took up the offer because I was low on cash at the time and it kind of stuck. I basically took this as a part time job. I don't know. I feel like that should be a bit of a positive smudge on my soul. I wasn't a burner for a reason other than money. I didn't crave chaos or overt control. I don't know. Maybe that just makes it worse.

In any chase, I said I wrote this as a confession to guilt but that's not all. I also wrote this as a warning. As a warning for you the average civilian. As a warning so that you can understand both how fragile and how artificial your society is. You should know that you have no control when organizations of such size and power rule over you with such beautiful social strategies. You should strive for freedom. This is not how humans were to spend their lives. This makes no sense! Understand the frailty of your society. After all,

Chad yelled triumphantly. The train wreckage burned brightly behind him. The flames were as bright as they were hot, but not as hot as his flame print button up shirt. Actually, the shirt was too hot, time to unbotton it. You're welcome ladies.

Man he loved his job. It was like being the star of a Michael Bay movie. This incident in particular reminded him of his favourite movie, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. All that was missing was his own Megan Fox. Any of these fine señoritas will do. Who wouldn't want to spend a night with the Chad. 

Chad strutted away from the burning wreckage behind him, abs on display, whilst the Spanish people around him screamed and ran for their lives. He shamelessly winked and did the finger pistols at each and every one of the pretty ladies at the police barricade. Unfortunately for Chad, they didn't notice this display of macho sexiness. He did however hear someone call out pendejo. What the hell did that mean? Who cared, those women were obviously gay. I mean who couldn't resist the Chad meat show? Nobody, that's who!

He met his handler waiting outside his luxury black Lexus sedan. She looked liked Scarlet Johansen with a fetish for leather and black sunglasses. You know she wanted the Chad, she was just too much of a prude to admit it. 

""Chad honestly, can you not wear a shirt for more than five minutes?"" exclaimed the handler. 

""You know you love it Violetta."" Chad boasted confidently.

""Oh please, anyway good job Chad"". Violetta threw him two fat stacks of cash. ""Here's your payment, Fox News is going to have a field day with this one"".

""What can I say? I'm the man."" A cheeky grin formed across Chads face. ""Ya know Violetta, we can make this Chad Meat show private"". Chad shot her his sexiest wink. 

""For the fiftieth time Chad no!"" Violetta stated vehemently. 

""Suit yourself baby. Imma go crush some brews and bang some bitches, Chad style"". Chad entered his vehicle and peeled off down the road, issuing a loud woo sound before he disappeared around the corner.

""Burners"" Violetta said to herself. She let out a resigned sigh.

There was nobody in the inside of the church, even though there was the faint scent of many perfumes; it must have been full only hours before. Moonlight came in in sections through the colored, circular windows, casting a kaleidoscopic aura on the rows of pine seats, the abandoned hymn books and bibles.

I walked down the aisle, not trying to be quiet because the soft carpet absorbed any sound made. My superiors, their spectacles flashing and their bodies held up with a confidence only bossy could muster, had informed me over lunch that this was the most revered cathedral in the country and that a simple ""tweak"" would be enough to get the news stations buzzing for a week. The security guards would be taken care of by Hanu, a colleague, and the surveillance cameras by Zuno. All I had to do was start the fire. We were not to be seen. 

Near the front, someone had left their tablet on the seats, and I tucked it in my jacket, since I did not own one. I could afford almost anything with the job I did but I had never thought of buying a tablet. I would wipe it out, remove the bible apps and whatever was on it, and perhaps put a security code of my own. I stood there for a while, distracted by the immorality that plagued my life and that of Hanu, of Zuno, of many others, the lies, the deaths the destruction we caused. 

The fire grew and hissed and moved like it was something alive. It ate the bibles and the carpet, the pine seats and flowers that decorated the podium and tore at the stained windows with a flick of its hot tongues. I had disappeared before the wailing of sirens.",Storiesdotcom

The math on those two would make your head spin. After all of my accomplishments all of my destruction.....I am tired...I have been alive longer than any human should be allowed to live, my body isn't even mine anymore. The body I was born with I has been modified for my ""chaos"" so many times I don't even remember what I used to look like. In my youth I took every steroid, drug, bio enhancement possible so that I could ""cause the best chaos possible"" or ""take down the man"" just like me was taught to do in the camps. now I’m so old age doesn't even matter to me anymore, all my burner brothers and sisters have either died out, killed themselves in some sort of flashy suicide attack or been hunted down by police, funny that they didn't tell us people will be trying to kill us once we exited the camp. All of this was so that the news stations would be able to have something new and exciting to put on their TVs. i had fun at first i won't try to say it wasn't fun, god was it fun. Once I figure out how to extend my life to it became even better. I was able to plan for years ahead of time, think of more creative ways to cause havoc. I would never have been able to figure out how to fill the Grand Canyon with water and drain half the ocean (surprisingly unrelated) had I only lived for a normal human life span. However now I can only guess my age and I stand upon my mountain of accomplishments I have to sit down and think why. The world I used to know has long since been destroyed and rebuilt the reason for my creation was forgotten by everyone besides me. I have decided I have two choices, change my ways and become a guiding hand to humans and try to prevent history from repeating its self or stay to my nature and destroy everything I see.

His wife worked half days on fridays, he drank at the bar by himself sometimes, his son didn't really like to play catch but they loved video games. And his car wasn't really the best either, but it was dependable.

It started slow with narcotics and other drugs like PCP. These chemicals worked schisms into his life, breaking his steady and pleasurable day to days down into midnight crawls to seedy alleys and other places. His wife started working weekends when he quit his job. His son hid in his room and didn't make a sound. His face grew gaunt.

And thats when he killed a man. In the middle of a high, he crushed a man's larynx and kept squeezing as bubbling saliva dripped from his toothy smile. And even though there was a man's life between his hands, there was only one thought. **This is how it should be.** The man's arms were flailing against the side of his head, but there was no give. He was an animal tuned to eleven and cranked for strength. He kicked and fought, thrashing about likely injuring his assailant. But then the man died.

That was about when the skewed perspectives and shifting lights and coercive voices faded enough for him to realize what he had done. He had killed the police chief in a brawl. The man was twice his size in terms of muscle and twice as able in terms of fighting.

Yet, he had killed the chief and couldn't even feel the concussion or the other broken bones the man had given him in his final moments.

A car door opened somewhere nearby, and his surroundings came into focus. He was behind a club of some sort. The heavy steel door was shut and a low thumping could be heard permeating the surroundings. A dumpster spilled over with garbage and a drizzle came down from the sky, flecking the florescent orange security lights with tiny motes of water that coalesced and fell into the alleyway and down a grimy storm drain.

He hoisted the body and felt his leg fold at a fourth joint underneath the man's weight, but still no pain. Shifting the weight to the other leg, the man dumped the body of the police chief into the dumpster and felt as if that car that had just had the door opened only a moment ago was waiting on him. He grabbed the wallet out of the chief's pocket and took all the money and cards out of it. He tossed the wallet on the ground and dropped the cards and money into the storm drain and walked towards where he felt the car was.

He hobbled out of the alleyway to a dark green sedan where two men occupied the driver and passenger seat. He sat in the back, as it should have been.

""Do you have any injuries?"" said the driver after he closed the door.

""Jaw, arm, leg, stomach, head.""

""Can he be any more specific than that?"" said the passenger, looking back at him.

""No, he's still early stages, it isn't a full alignment yet. There is still some of *him* in there."" said the driver.

But he shouldn't be in here, that was how it should not have been.

""So what happens now?""

""Now? Well he looked like he was limping- is your leg broken?"" 

""Yes."" He was beginning to feel more intensive and less transparent in his mind. Like a ghost becoming a solid object, he was becoming more aware of how queer his situation truly was.

""Well, we're going to have to smash his car and hospitalize him."" the driver said.

""We could do a story on his car accident."" the passenger said.

""Nah, not big enough. We don't want his face getting too familiar yet."" the driver said. The driver pulled a phone from his pocket and dialed a number. ""Yeah uh, this is Jack's Towing, I was givin' you guys a call to see if there were any accidents around town."" the driver said with a practiced accent. ""At the corner of Harmony and Lake? Alrighty, we'll be there shortl'eh."" said the driver. He hung up and looked at the passenger. ""Find those two streets for me."" the driver said.

The passenger started working with his phone. ""Turn left here and head out of town, its a little bit out into the suburbs."" said the passenger. ""Who is meeting us there? Heather?""

""No, Daniel is the one we have tonight. You need to be more aware of that all times. Plan, plan, plan. You have *got* to **plan**. Knowing who you're working with is the most basic step.""",Heagram

Leaders of the most powerful nations had been invited, all to observe the signing of the treaty and offer their support as neighbouring lands. 

Unlike the presidential guests, Jerome Mestill had been invited to the party for one reason, and that was to stir trouble. He abstained from petty crimes and meaningless disasters. Having a much finer taste, more delicate and calculated then your average burner. If they were house wine, he was a fine brand of riesling. 

Smirking, he pocketed his Iphone. Tomorrow morning the scandal would hit the headlines, 'First Lady sleeps with tall, dark and handsome stranger.' He could imagine the gasps of shock, the intrigue, the trouble it would cause for months. Straightening his coat tie, he glanced at her one last time, the even rise and falls of her chest under the white duvet made it clear that she was asleep. 

Walking to the door, a glint of gold on the back room dresser caught his eye. Jerome paused, strolling over and picking up the object. The golden ring rested neatly in his palm, three lines engrained into it's metal. He whistled, the thing was either weighted or pure. Flipping it onto his middle finger, it was a perfect fit, a surge of pride filled his chest. ""Not bad Mr.President, not bad at all."" He said to himself.

The drive home was quick, and he sent through the pictures before hanging up his suit and hitting the sheets. 

Waking, his suit still hung where he had left it. Flicking on the remote, a TV screen buzzed down from the roof above his bed. This was his moment, he grinned in excitement. 

""In the news today, America fires eleven warheads towards the middle. . .""

""What?"" Jerome said out loud. 

Snatching his phone off the bedside table, he rang Molly, his journalist at the station. 

""Jerome?"" She answered.

""Molly, what the heck is this?"" He asked, angrily into the receiver. 

""I'm sorry, your story has been put on the back burner for now. Apparently someone drugged the president's wife and stole the nuclear codes.""

His eyebrows shot up, ""The codes?""

""Well, I've got this from a pretty accurate source. But they're not actual codes. It's an object with the codes engraved into it. We're sitting on the verge of world war four here, Jer.""

""Oh. . . Shit."" 

""Yeah sorry, I've gotta go. Your story will be up in a couple of wee-""


*Click.*

Jumping up, he snatched the ring from his pocket. He ran a thumb over the markings engraved on its head, slowly. They weren't just simple lines, but more like hundreds of small dots joined together, like the parts to a code. 

Jerome gulped. "" Well, I think I'm up for a pay rise.""

[WP] An angry stepmother accidentally adopts Bruce Wayne instead of Cinderella,FoldingUserFerrariic,"He stood on the roof of the apartment building, hidden in the shadows.  His eyes were fixed on the 4th floor balcony of the building across the street.  The door was cracked open to let the cool night air in.  Gotham had been hot this summer, the days nearly unbearable--not that he knew it.  He spent nearly every day in his attic room above the west tower.  She only let her little bat out at night, so long as he brought her fruit.

He shifted his weight, and the pigeons on the clothesline flapped their wings momentarily, but settled again.  He slowly backed away from the ledge, keeping his eye on the balcony across the street.  He rose, sprinted, and leapt.  
  
Few on the street below would have noticed him, fewer still would have believed their eyes.  He glided to a stop.  Quiet, but noisier than he would have liked.  He stood outside the sliding glass door, his back to the wall.  He listened for sounds from within.  There was the squeaking of a fan, but nothing more.  
  
He slipped inside.  The apartment's living room was large, dark, and empty.  The squeaking from the fan was accompanied by a glow coming from the open door down the hallway.  He checked the mantle, the coffee table, the end table, but found no fruit he could bring back to Her.  The squeaking beckoned him.  He slowly slunk his way toward the glowing bedroom door.   
  
Nothing moved inside except the squeaking fan.  He tilted one eye around the door frame to see inside.  The ceiling light was broken, the desk-fan on the side table was oscillating slowly back and forth as it blew air over the woman's body.  She was pretty.  Had been pretty.  Her mouth had been cut at the corners, the grotesqueness hidden in a slather of bright red lipstick.  Her face seemed paler than it should be with unblinking blue eyes fixed on some invisible horror on the ceiling.  She had bruises around her neck.
  
He stood, staring, not knowing what to make of it.  Strangled, obviously.  But the makeup was odd.  He set about searching the room.  A necklace on the nightstand, hear-shaped with the word ""Gordon"" engraved on the back.  Some earings and bracelets on the dresser.  All good fruit to take back home.",Tokugawa

"[EU] You are The Doctor. The Doctor Seuss, that is.",Niggardly_Elucidator,"Her screams echoed throughout the cabin  as people at the back craned their necks to see what the fuss was. 

“Is it terrorists!? Oh my god!” a woman with a bulging face and hair like a loofah yelled out.

“Calm down madam, everything is under control! We have a surprise birth taking place but we have everything control.” the flight attendant responds smoothing his long fringe down over his perfectly manicured right eyebrow. This lessened the screaming coming from the other passengers, however for Millie O’Naught who was now lying on her back in the middle of the aisle with he dress around her waist it did little to appease her. Her legs up in the birthing position and her body wet with sweat and a pool of amniotic fluid she had become a repeated scream. The flight attendant continued.

“I myself have plenty of training and experience handling this kind of, OH SWEET LORD JESUS LOOK AT THAT! YEP THAT’S WHERE IT’S GONNA COME OUT!” turning around and being greeted with a front and centre view of poor Millie’s vagina was not on the flight attendants to do list. 

The other 3 female flight attendants had already taken up the duty of placating the other passengers, many of whom had flown into a panic. Children egged on by Millie’s shrieks began bawling, those with anxiety about flying had started biting their nails and pulling their hair out, and one man had peeked out into the aisle and promptly been sick everywhere.

“Is there a doctor in the house? Anybody here who is a doctor or a midwife, or... I don’t know, who here did a really good job packing big things into their small carry on luggage, thats gotta count for something. You!” he pointed an accusatory finger at a very posh looking lady next to him, “Your bag was tiny, you hav’ta be good at this birthing business.”


From the very back of the airplane a man called out as he rose from his seat. 
“A doctor you say? A doctor you need? Well i’ll find you one, and do it with speed!” The man ran into the lavatory shutting the door behind him and then everyone heard a loud bang. Then a bonk. Then a honk! Boom! Ping! Wing-wing-wing-wing... and BOOM! The door burst open again and there stood the man now sporting medical scrubs and a very tall striped hat.


“Sir, this is no time for messing around, this woman needs serious medical attention!” the flight attendant said nervously touching his fringe.


“My dear friend, my name’s Dr. Seuss, and I have a feeling I can be of great use! This lady’s in labor, thats awful tricky, and you’re afraid of her parts that are private and sticky. You need someone like me to help you out, to help this baby and put an end to the shouts!”


“Sir please be seated you are clearly not of sound mind” said the flight attendant.


“HELP ME! AAAH!” Millie roared louder than any of her previous screams, causing  Dr Seuss to jump in to action. Pushing past the flight attendant and with a leather bag in hand he sprang down the aisles. Approaching the woman he put his gloved hand on her wrist.


“One contraction... two contraction... red contraction... blue contraction. How do you feel?”

Molly looks up at him grunting and gritting her teeth. The pressure of birth has grown such that her screams have been turned into snorts and rattles of breath.
“She feels terrible now get away from her Mr Seuss!” the flight attendant started bustling towards them.


“I am the doctor and I speak for the lady, she needs my help to have this baby! What is your name sir? 

And one more thing... can you hold her legs with care? Can you hold them in the air?”

“Oh my I don’t think I can, I could not hold them, Sam I am. I mean my name is Sam. Not sure why I said it like that.”


“Could you hold her hand instead? Can you help her rest her head?” said the Dr making space for Sam to step over bright red Molly. The doctor bent down towards her action zone.

“Babies like to have something sweet, to speed up a birth try using a treat!” The doctor produced a candy cane from his sleeve and began waiving it at the woman’s private.

“Doctor I am very sure that is not a proper birthing techn-oww!” Sam was cut off by Molly who had begun squeezing his hand with a grip like a crocodiles bite.


“I assure you Sam I am not clowning, with certainty this ladies crowning! This lolly is great for baby morale, it’s bursting right out the birth canal!”


“Just breathe lady, and keep on pushing!” Sam said his hand going red from Molly’s impressive grip.


“I CAN SEE THE HEAD!” cried out the semi hysterical woman with loofah hair.
“Quiet madame I insist you shush! This lady needs but one big push! While we see it’s face is there, it has not cleared her downstairs hair. Baby is not quite out, he looks quite stuck.” At that moment then Molly yelled 
“Fuck!”


“It’s having trouble being fully vacated, perhaps you were not fully dilated? Fortunately for you I am aware of a rule, one that I learned in Medical school! Should the baby ever stop, then comes the time to hop on top!”
Molly yelled in fright again, and was renewed with passion to push this baby out as quick as possible. She huffed and she puffed and POP! Out came the baby into Dr Seuss’s arms. 


“Congratulations, today is your day, you’ve given birth to a boy I say!” Placing the baby into her outstretched arms as she caught her breath she looked around at the cabin full of faces watching her intently. 


“Well. I never thought this would be how my birthing would be... but I have to say I am so grateful for all of your help. Thank you Sam for holding my hand. And thank you Doctor, you have been of immeasurable help. In fact... I haven’t quite decided on a name yet. Would you do me the honour of naming my baby boy?” The Dr positively beamed and turned in a circle on the spot.


“That is very kind! I’m over joyed, a chance to name this baby boy! This task is great and quite a delight, i’ll come up with a name, one thats right! I can feel one coming, inch by inch, I’ve got the perfect name... how about Grinch?”",thenigelhawkins

""Mornin' Bob.""

""So, Jim - it's been a month since you started at TOOF, howya likin' it?""

Jim's face creased into a slight smile, and paused to take a sip from a small dixie cup. ""I have to say I kinda like it - the architecture of the place takes a little getting used to, and the bosses seem to be a little reclusive, but that's OK, you know?""

""Heh, yeah - it gets a little weird sometimes, but I think that's what keeps this place going, the corporate culture is unique, but also straight-forward - here at TOOF, they keep it simple - you do your assignments, and management sticks to the work contracts, no messing around. Really refreshing stuff when the rest of the corporate world has basically gone tits up.""

Jim cut in: ""You mean BLOWN UP!""

Stifling a hearty giggle, they took the elevator down to their offices on sub-level 9. As the door parts to the side, a clean and brightly lit hallway stretched out before them, a series of doors on either side. As they continued into the hall, they threw out their cups, and straightened their Ventablack scrubs. Once in the office, formality is everything.

""Ready, Jim?""

""Ready, Bob.""

Swiping a key card, the two enter to a pitch black room, their iridescent green pupils, the only light. Picking up a clipboard, Bob rattled off the work order.

""Okaayyy - Supplication to Shoggoth, Two and ..and a half? virgins.... oh yeah, that kid....and a 4:30pm Skype to wrap it up with our Tokyo people."" 

Jim lit six black candles, and prepared the workspace. ""Y'know what I liked about getting hired here? The health benefits - I mean, me, my kids, even their grandchildren are covered by the plan here, and no drama with HMO's""

""yeah, Jim I know what you mean - over at Blofeld Corp, people are just waiting around to get shot or eaten by sharks!""

The two laugh as they drew back a heavy cloth, revealing a cage with three people, naked and sleeping. 

""Uuuhh, JIM?!""

""Yeah?""

""Looks like they're getting smarter, we only got one virgin now.""

Jim threw a small thin knife into the floor. ""FUCK!....It's gonna be a long day, yeah?""

Bob nodded. ""Aaaayup.""

Health insurance, dental, paid parental leave etc.",SirFluffyTheTerrible,"""Hello, you called Customer Service for Old One's Incorporated. My name is Jake, how may I help you?""

Calm, pleasant and professional. The core values for the company, Jake liked to think he represented them all in equal fairness- even when the call started off like this one.

""Ha-Ha, very funny. No... no sir, I'm not wearing khakis."" 

For any watching the scene, the flash of hatred and the glowing of spiraled and ancient runic tattoos might have been unnerving, but that was exactly why Old One's Incorporated didn't allow video calls. That adjustment had implemented after the first three months of business. Shortly before Jake had come on staff, but he had heard the stories.

""May I ask, what seems to be your issue today sir?""

The voice buzzed in his ear. Yet another one of *these* calls...

""Ah, right, right... I understand. We see a lot of blood and familial line contracts here- especially recently. You know, with the eclipse coming up and all.""

The buzzing continued, as the headset was adjusted to lower the volume. Shouting was no way to work with a person. Calm, pleasant, and professional: Remember the values.

""Yes, I understand. No, I'm afraid that's simply part of the contract-""

He held his tongue, as the tattoos began to glow again, and the whispers of ancient tongues began to sing of blood, and death and- *""Calm, pleasant, and professional.""*

""Right. Well sir, if you had sealed and branded your flesh according to the exact instructions, I believe the results might have been more to your liking, but it says in your file you went to an outside contractor for the tattoo portion.""

Oh? What's this? A quieting in the buzzing over the line? Who could imagine why? Checkmate punk-

Remember the *values*...

""No sir, we strongly recommend the contracts be met with a familiar or the original source. It is clearly stated on all signed forms of the original draftings.""

The voice began to shout, as the headphones dropped lower still. It was never enough for some clients- no respect in this day and age. Those spiral brandings on his flesh were starting to glow red again.

""I'm very sorry to hear that sir.""

He sighed quietly, as the line continued- obscenities flowing like a flood through the soft cushion of his headset.

""Yes, I'll be sure to pass you along to my manager- please hold.""

Click. The line began to play soft tones of smooth jazz. ""Sunshine Soul"" by the New York Jazz Ensemble. He could listen to that for hours on a soothing repeat. It wasn't much help at Five Fifteen on a Friday though.

God-damn it all... Some days... Some days... If he wasn't getting health insurance, dental, and a 10% match on his 401k with a decent quarterly upsell bonus, Jake seriously would consider wearing those god-damn khakis and biting the bullet.

""Damn it..."" He mumbled, as he thumbed out the extension to transfer the call. The week was almost up, and their department had been promised a Pizza Thursday if they finished the month without any more escalations to management.

Jake paused, hand hovering over the final number, considering. There was one way out of this, but he only got one- two of these a year, tops. Charles from Marketing did owe him a favor, though.

""Fuck it."" 

He growled, as he threw the line to sales instead, hammering down the ""*Seven*"" with a trace of guilt. 

""They can sort this shit out.""

He might get a note on his file for it, but he never got strikes. Calm, pleasant and professional- Jake would have a clear record by the end of the next quarter anyways, and one call wasn't worth risking Pizza Thursday over.

Especially not on a Friday Afternoon.",wercwercwerc

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello Employees,

I would like to be the first to congratulate you on a fantastic closing of our first quarter. When the great void first opened into the eternal depths and we peered into the hell machines maw we saw the birth of a new dawn. From within its infinite cogs moving in ways which we could never comprehend. How could we possibly question it, especially now? For its strings had already been woven deep within the recesses of time, laying forth our damnation before we were even a concept. For what does an immortal being know of the pain of time? None, so let us slumber now as it whispers its song in the golden tongue, let us slumber as the void had done once before. 

Additionally we have recently received our Customer Service evaluation, and I'm proud to announce that we received high scores across the board, bringing us no.1 in customer satisfaction. We can all be proud in this announcement, as everyone had taken the hand of the fallen angel; weep within his sanctum and allow your fear to turn primal. Our screams reach out and writhe the neck of the one who calls him self God, but he is not there. For I am all that is eternal.

Lastly, there have been rumors of us acquiring a new company. I'm very excited to announce that the rumors are true, and we have finalized the acquisition of the Coca-Cola Company. More information on this exciting new adventure will be provided at the next Town Hall Meeting.

P.S. Next week we will be celebrating Customer Appreciation week. Please check your e-mails for an announcement from HR detailing the fun activities we'll be hosting all through out the week.

Thank you,

""I'm sorry I don't think I understand."" He said. ""Oh right, right, right. You still don't know how this works."" He said. 

""You see Tim, contrary to popular belief, I don't actually feed off people's souls or collect them or whatever the mainstream media says I do."" He explained. ""What I do feed off of is psychic energy, things like emotions and bad thoughts and stuff like that. And all you humans really think of is money! So when I came to this world I figured that rather than try and take over and enslave mankind, I'll just start one of these 'banks' I heard about and you'll just hand your money over to me. Once I have your money I get all of your resentment and all of your negative thoughts and that makes *me* happy."" Mr. Quinn explained. 

""I, guess that makes sense. But what does all of that have to do with me?"" Tim asked. ""Right here's the thing Tim. I don't need people who are blindly loyal to this company or to me for that matter. If I wanted that I would have stuck with the same plan I had for 500 years. No what I need is people who are only in it for themselves, who get involved only to milk everybody else and get out before they notice. And you my friend you've got that."" 

Tim didn't know what to think. He came up here thinking he was about to die and now the head of the company was sitting here praising him. ""Now I'm not saying your a bad person by no means. That's actually why I've been interested in you. You're selfish enough not to get attached but nice enough to make things work. The fact is I've got way too many 'bad guys' in my cabinet and they're all plotting to take me down. I need someone who I can trust and I think that's you. So I'm offering you a serious promotion."" 

Tim looked at Mr. Quinn in shock. First he thought the man was going to kill him now he's giving him a promotion?""You-you're kidding me, right?"" He asked incredulously. ""No joke. I want you to be my new VP of sales!"" He said. Tim thought he might have a heart attack. VP of Sales? He could hardly believe it. Mistaking his silence for doubt Mr. Quinn continued. ""It'll have much much better pay then you're getting now and you get full insurance for everything. I could even transfer that pretty girl Janet, make her your new secretary, huh"" He ribbed him. 

""No, Janet's way to smart to just be a secretary, she'd never accept that."" Tim said. Mr. Quinn looked at him in shock before laughing outrageously and slapping his knee. ""Haha I'm loving it, you crack me up Tim! Alright we'll make her title Executive Assistant, she'll manage the day to day stuff won't get bored I promise. So do we have a deal?"" Mr. Quinn asked and held out his hand. 

Tim smiled deviously and shook the offered hand. ""Deal!"". ",searchin4somewhere
"[WP] A terrifying, ancient god awakens from their slumber deep beneath the ocean...and promptly form a company. You're a new employee at the Old One's firm, the benefits are pretty good. Health insurance, dental, paid parental leave etc.",SirFluffyTheTerrible,"He made his way slowly to the elevator, walking zombie like as his coworkers gazed at him in awkward silence. He knew as well as they did that this was it, he would never return. So they all watched in pained silence as he walked past the water cooler for the final time. Tim glanced to his left and saw Janet, the cute blonde on his floor. She looked at him sadly before turning away, a tear beginning to bead in her eye. It was then that it hit him, he would probably never see any of them ever again. He was so lost in his own sadness that he hardly realized that he had given his boss a final handshake before riding the elevator up. 

The elevator went straight to the 50th floor, no stopping in between. Tim briefly wondered if that was a coincidence or if the Big Boss had something to do with it. He supposed it didn't matter much. In only a matter of seconds he was standing outside the office of the company president. An ancient looking door carved from black marble and covered with ancient runes. It looked out of place on the otherwise normal office building floor. 

As he approached he finally noticed the secretary sitting outside the office. A middle aged woman filing her nails. Yet another sight that seemed eerily out of place. 

""Go on in. He's been expecting you."" She said before Tim could even say anything. She hadn't even looked up from her nails. Tim swallowed nervously and pushed open the heavy doors. Inside all he saw was blackness. He turned to the secretary confused, but she offered no words. Taking a deep breath he walked inside. All around him it was dark, only the light from the doorway shined through. But that soon disappeared as the marble doors slammed shut leaving him in pitch black nothingness. He stumbled about blindly for a few moments. 

""Hello?"" He called out. 

**Tim Doherty?** Replied a booming voice. Tim nearly crapped his pants. The voice came from everywhere around him. He was sure he was about to be devoured. 

""Y-yes s-s-sir."" He stammered out still looking around, desperate to make something out in the darkness. He heard a snapping of fingers and the room was suddenly lit by dozens of flames. The room he was in was stone from floor to ceiling and was impossibly large; larger than should be possible in a building this size. In front of him was a large stone desk that looked more like a sacrificial altar. Behind that desk sat the most menacing figure he'd ever seen in his life. ",searchin4somewhere
"[WP] A terrifying, ancient god awakens from their slumber deep beneath the ocean...and promptly form a company. You're a new employee at the Old One's firm, the benefits are pretty good. Health insurance, dental, paid parental leave etc.",SirFluffyTheTerrible,"Tim was nervous, more nervous than he had ever been in his life. 

No, that's not quite right. In fact Tim was downright terrified. He was utterly afraid for his life. He knew working at Mythic LLC was a gamble and possibly a morally questionable decision, but for a recent college grad with a business and accounting major there weren't a lot of options for him. When he started a little less than two years ago he hadn't known what to expect, but it turned out his job wasn't so terrible. Sure there was the daily office grind, but the pay was great and he was offered a lot of benefits. So much so that he'd happily manage accounts and finances every day for 8 hours straight. 

But now he was seriously questioning his decision and his sanity for ever agreeing to work here. He had been called up to meet the boss. Not just his boss but **The Boss**, the president and founder of the company, the ancient multidimensional being who built a multi million dollar company in just three years and was known for driving his competition insane, literally. He briefly contemplated just jumping out the window rather than face the horrifying entity. 

The worst part was that he knew exactly why he was being called in. Just two weeks ago an irate customer was yelling at the front desk secretary, screaming about wanting his money back and how everyone who worked at the firm was a 'damned demonic puppet'. Tim had the unfortunate luck to be coming into work at the same time the man was airing his complaints. It wasn't too unusual to see some religious fanatic protesting in or around the company property. This one though, had thought to bring a gun with him and when he pointed it at Tim asking: ""Why shouldn't I send your doomed soul to the pits of hell right now?"" all Tim could think to say was... 

""Look, I'm just here so I can get paid."" 

It was an honest response. Tim was scared the wacko would kill him but he just had a look of complete and utter bewilderment. That is until security tackled him to the floor. After that he had been called in to a review by his department's boss several other senior executives. When they finally got around to asking him why he responded the way he did, all he could tell them was that it was the truth. They let him go after that and Tim was sure he had dodged a bullet. But when he walked into the office this morning he noticed everyone looking at him with mixed expressions of sadness, horror, and curiosity. 

It wasn't until he got to his desk that he realized why. Sitting right next to his computer in his office mail box was a large, black envelope addressed to him in bold red ink. The only person who used those kinds of envelopes was the big boss himself. Slowly, tentatively, he opened the envelope. The paper inside said only five words; *""See me in my office.""* written in the same red ink. It was at that moment that Tim felt his soul practically leave his body. He thought he had known true fear when that maniac held a gun to his head, but what he felt then couldn't even compare to how he felt now. ",searchin4somewhere
"[WP] A terrifying, ancient god awakens from their slumber deep beneath the ocean...and promptly form a company. You're a new employee at the Old One's firm, the benefits are pretty good. Health insurance, dental, paid parental leave etc.",SirFluffyTheTerrible,"He had jet black hair, oiled and slicked back. His skin was pale and he wore a black pinstriped suit with a blood orange shirt and black tie. He had a jagged scar running diagonally from his forehead down through his left eye, which was pale and blinded. His right cheek had another scar in the shape of an x. Despite his worn appearance though, he looked young like he was in his late twenties. 

He sat behind his desk, hands folded and eyes narrowed. Tim gazed back at him, his heart feeling like it was about to burst out his chest. Finally the man spoke, his voice no longer booming or intimidating, but soft as velvet. ""Hello Tim, you may call me Mr. Quinn."" He said while getting up. He strode over to where Tim stood and extended his hand. Tim shook it expecting it to be cold and lifeless, but he was surprised to discover it didn't feel any different from his own.  

""It's uhh it's a real honor to meet you, Mr. Quinn."" He said, his voice still cracking from nervousness. ""Hah, that's what they all say."" He mentioned before waving his arm and gesturing back towards his desk. Tim followed him to his desk where Mr. Quinn sat back onto his red leather chair. 

""Please have a seat."" He said. Tim looked at him in confusion before he realized that another leather chair had appeared beside him. He was sure that hadn't been there before. Somewhat reluctantly Tim sat down in the ornately decorated chair and looked back over to Mr. Quinn who smiled at him.  

""Do you know why I called you here Tim?"" He asked. Tim adjusted his tie nervously. ""Is it uhh, because of the, incident... in the lobby."" Tim asked. Mr. Quinn nodded sagely and laced his fingers together on his desk. 
""Yes, an armed man came into the lobby and put a gun to your head isn't that right?"". ""Yes sir."" Tim said. 
""And you said something to him didn't you? Tell me what was it that you told him?"" Mr. Quinn asked his eyes shining in the fire light. Tim swallowed nervously, his legs shaking from fright as he quietly spoke the words. ""I'm just here so I can get paid."" 

""Yes! Ha-ha! That's it! I love it!"" Mr. Quinn shouted suddenly. Tim, startled, looked at him and saw a wide grin on his face. ""I'm... sorry?"" He asked. Mr. Quinn laughed again before waving his hand dismissively at him. ""Oh relax Tim you're not in any trouble. I swear you mortals take everything so seriously."" He said. ""I'm not?"" Tim asked again confused. ""No of course not."" He said getting up and walking around the desk to lean against it. 

""Here's the thing Tim, have you ever wondered why I, an ancient and malevolent deity from another dimension would want to create a Banking company?"" Mr. Quinn asked. Unsure of where the conversation was going Tim simply replied honestly. ""Well, not really. To be honest I only really skimmed your interviews in the papers.""

Health insurance, dental, paid parental leave etc.",SirFluffyTheTerrible,"Screams, shrill and piercing, resonate through the stale office air. I shiver despite myself, and run a hand over the back of my neck to smooth down the small army of hairs that had been standing on end. Another yelp, this time accompanied by a flicker of the overhead fluorescent, echoes past my cubicle. This is the second one today. I rub my eyes and look down at my watch. Not even 8:30 yet.  
  
  
With a squeak, Ted wheels his chair across the aisle and leans in to me. My unofficial mentor. Unlike me, claiming the title as the undisputed newbie on this floor with less than one year under my belt, Ted had started as an intern back when the place first opened its doors, and the days of cowering his way through initiation trials and elimination reviews were behind him. Eight years, several dodged sacrificial brands, and many drunken company solstice parties later, he now found himself comfortably jaded and stalled on the mid-level rungs of this corporate ladder.  
  
  
Seeming not the least bit perturbed, he juts a finger at the manager’s office and with a raised brow asks, “hey – who they got in there today?”   
  
  
“Bob, from accounting,” I answer with a shrug.   
  
  
“Ahhhhhh …”   
   
  
Judy pops up from her desk and does a hasty scan of the horizon before coming to the edge of her partition and peering over the wall at us like Kilroy with purple spectacles.   
  
  
“Ohhhh, is THAT who that was? See, I thought so. Barb said it was Larry from customer relations, but I just knew I heard Bob in there. I’d recognize that southern inflection on the ‘no no NOOOOO’ just anywhere, I tell you!”   
  
  
She continues clucking away about why he must be in there, rattling off a litany of scandals she can personally attest to and tittering every so often when she feels she has said something particularly clever. Ted, meanwhile, gives her a half-hearted nod and wheels himself back to his area, rolling his eyes at me as he passes.   
  
  
I follow his lead with a weak smile and nod of my own before grabbing my coffee mug and excusing myself to go find a refill. The high pitches of her voice recede into the distance as I approach the lounge and find my way to the coffeemaker. I grab the pot with no small amount of relief, but immediately curse as I lift it far too easily. Knowing all too well what to expect, I nevertheless upend it over my cup, and watch as a cold trickle ekes its way out of the spout.   
  
  
“For the love of antichrist!!!” I curse aloud, knuckles turning white where I grip the handle.   
  
  
No one around this place can grasp simple break room etiquette. When you pour the last of the coffee, start a new brew. This isn’t rocket science. I hurl the pot against the wall and let loose a howl as the glass shatters and rains down like brimstone onto the carpet. If I’m not having a hot cup of joe, no one is.  
  
  
Brian, eyes wide and mouth panting, darts into the room, surveys the scene, and then looks in my direction with a narrowed gaze. He opens his mouth to speak, but stops short as the collar around his neck jerks suddenly and pulls him back. He falls to all fours, bracing himself against the floor as the entire building begins to shake with oncoming footsteps.  
  
  
The earthquake is short-lived, and before long the behemoth to blame appears in the doorway. Brian drops back to his haunches and looks up at Aeoyarth, our boss, fourth son of the ancient one, and seventh in line for successor to the company.   
    
  
“I’m sorry, sir, but it looks like there’s no coffee right now, and thanks to HIM, the floor is covered in glass.” Brian casts a meaningful glare at me. “But don’t worry, sir! I’ll personally pick every shard out of the carpet with my tongue if necessary, and if you need a hot beverage you can of course open up any of my veins!”   
  
  
I suppose no office is complete without a shameful sycophant, but something about Brian just makes my stomach turn. Aeoyarth brushes past him, clutching the chains to Brian’s manacles loosely in his claw.  
  
  
“Well!” he says to me with a toothy grin and booming voice. “If it isn’t our villain of the month!”  
  
  
“Guilty as charged,” I say, and tip my empty mug at him.   
    
  
“I must say, kid - I’m impressed. Your numbers have been through the roof through the last quarter, and our souls collected have nearly tripled as a result of your efforts alone. I’m beginning to think your talents are being squandered here in the low ranks of the acquisitions department. Come to my office later, and let’s chat about your future at our firm. It seems there are going to be some immediate openings.”  
   
  
He turns and heads back toward his office, tail protruding from a smart Armani suit and swaying from side to side.  
  
  
“Oh, and when you get back to your seat, could you send Ted to see me, please?”

"[WP] A terrifying, ancient god awakens from their slumber deep beneath the ocean...and promptly form a company. You're a new employee at the Old One's firm, the benefits are pretty good. Health insurance, dental, paid parental leave etc.",SirFluffyTheTerrible,"""So so sorry I'm late, boss. It won't happen again."" I stand with my arms hanging limply at my sides, unsure of what body language to adopt. The roiling, amorphous mass of eyes, mouths, tentacles, and other appendages (whose nature I dare not question) that is my employer replies by babbling in a language that I could not pronounce if I wanted to, and which makes me slightly nauseous.

I don't know what it said, or if it was even talking to me, but judging by the fact that I haven't been reduced to an oily stain on the carpet or ripped apart and sucked into one of those massive sets of jaws, I take it as, ""It's fine this time, but don't let it happen again."" I quickly give my thanks and rush to my cubicle.

As I approach my station, I can hear my neighboring worker and friend Jeremy speaking to a client. ""Listen, buddy, I'm doing everything I can for you but you've got to understand: temporary insanity is simply a risk you take when you use our products. ... Yes, I'm aware that the warnings are written in an indecipherable ancient script, but I'm a salesman, not a teacher, so unless you're hiring me as a personal tutor- ... Yeah, same to you, pal. Thanks for calling Gla'hubgal'ga'gabub Industries.""

I give Jeremy a wry smile as he hangs up. I've known him for years, even before the Great One's Awakening, but he's changed ever since landing this job. He used to be shy, overly compromising, even a doormat. But ever since he survived the job interview, he's been turning things around. 

Come to think of it, so have I. My panic attacks have almost disappeared, and even my acne has started to lessen. One of the IT guys told me it's because being within 100 yards of the boss causes your brain to rearrange itself over time, but I dunno. I think maybe he just plays too many video games.

""Late start today, huh, Amy? Glad to see you didn't get promoted to Snack."" Jeremy chuckles.

I give him a joking glare. ""Very funny. I like to think I'd at least be a decent sized lunch. Was that the Grandma guy again?"" 

He sighs and rubs his temples, saying, ""Yeah, again. I tried to tell him, when you use the Ichor of the Old One to resurrect someone who's been dead for longer than a year or so, you can't really expect them to look, or smell, all that fresh.""

I begin to laugh, but give a small yelp of pain as I feel a sudden pinching at the back of my. Reaching back, I grab hold of what looks like a purple, shimmering grub worm, but is about the size of my forearm. ""Ugh, my symbiote is acting up again. Have the new models hatched yet?"" I flick the offending creature on its side, and it gives a hiss and loosens its grip on my flesh.

""Nah, they're not due for another couple of weeks. Johnson tells me they're expanding the telepathy range by 30 feet, though, so *someone* should have an easier time flirting with Jane..."" 

My cheeks immediately go red. ""Quiet, you."" Out of instinct I glance toward my crush's cubicle, but she doesn't appear to be there. All the better; I need to get some work done already anyway. Jeremy gives me a wink, and I return it, sitting down at my desk, putting on my gloves, and scrying for potential clients using the viscera of a young goat.

"[IP] ""Ruins Underground"" by Pierre Raveneau",SirFluffyTheTerrible,"######[](#dropcap)

Hilary Flint marveled for a moment, his eyes stretching higher and higher until the columns of marble and weathered sandstone seemed to vanish in the upper reaches of the cavern. 

""Well fuck.""

Faith paused next to him and scanned the crumbling ruins for herself. 

""At my best estimates, these ruins date back at least ten thousand years to the First Galetian Empire, one of the first Pan-Faerie civilizations to come into being. Look at the tops of the columns and their fluted orders, that's a telltale sign of it. And those curved supports, another common motif of the Galetians.""

Flint shuffled a boot, knocking a handful of sand down into the chasm. He could barely make out the bottom.   

""Goddammit...  I was really hoping we wouldn't come across anything down here.""

Faith gave him a puzzled look.

""What do you mean?""

""This piles of rocks was not originally here,"" he explained. ""That means it was taken wholesale from Elfhame and deposited here through a Tear. And if a Tear's here who knows what sort of nasties are crawling through it.""

""...We could turn around, try another route,"" Faith suggested. Flint shook his head.

""No, we don't have enough time to trek back. We're just gonna have to move fast and loud through the ruins and hope that there's nothing too big or too numerous for us to tackle. Christ Almighty, I'm too tired for this Tomb Raider shit.""

"[EU] Due to another financial meltdown, Bruce Wayne has gone bankrupt. Now, juggling 2 minimum wage jobs and struggling to pay rent, he attempts to still fight crime while being tempted to break the law himself to survive.",WriterDavidChristian,"""Welcome to McDonalds! What would you like to order?""

Bruce forced his faced into the practiced smile he's cultivated over the years. To the outside observer, he was just another employee, the uniform and setting all but erasing the signs of the billionaire he once was. As an extra insurance, he topped it off his outfit with a pair of plain eyeglasses - a little trick he learned from Clark.

*It's better this way*, he convinced himself. *I learned who my true friends are, I'm no longer expected to be seen out in public, I'm in control of my life.*

The memories of the past year still stung, the sudden collapse in stock, the foreclosures and repossessions. Scandals had popped up in every major subsidiary Wayne Enterprises near-simultaneously, all while he had been busy with the Justice League. *I should have kept a better eye on the company. Let Hal or Diana take the mission for once. Stay local longer.*

He sighed as he tallied up the customer's order. It would only be another 6 hours of this before he would be finished.

...

He trudged into his one-bedroom apartment, the snow and mud tracking a stain into the carpet behind him. His eyes turned up to the plastic wall clock hanging above the kitchen table. *10:00 PM already?* Pulling out a microwavable meat pocket, he set it to a few minutes and began to strip out of his jacket. He stretched down, out from under the bed, retrieving a dark full-body suit. It was one of the three batsuits he kept before burning, then exploding all that remained of the cave under his former estate. He had spared no expense (of what little remained) in order to bury any evidence of his former activities. It was quite a hassle timing the explosives in order to disguise it as a natural earthquake.

**DING!** His dinner was finished, one-half frozen while the other half painful to the touch. It hurt, but he ate quickly, ever vigilant of the time. According the intel he'd gathered over the past two weeks, a large robbery was scheduled to tonight at the chemical warehouse. Not a trace of Bruce Wayne remained as he snuck out of the window, disappearing to the rooftops and across the city.

...

They were all down, with the exception of what appeared to be the leader. *Male. 25 to 40 years of age. His earlier orders imply that he relays instructions from the true organizers. Erratic and scared. Likely to talk.*

""Who are you working for?!"" he growled as he lifted up the ill-fated robber by the collar.

""AHH! Please Batman! Don't hurt me! My... my... parents..""

He repeated, emphasizing each syllable as if to drive home the point.

""WHO. ARE. YOU. WORKING FOR?""

""My-my-my parents were killed when I was-was a little kid. I grew up with nothing! I had-to I had to steal, else I would a starved- Please, I promise I ain't gonna-""

""GIVE ME A NAME""

""Scarecrow! Please- you have to understand- nobody would hire a felon. I had no choice! Scarecrow- he-he gives you no choice!""

It was all that he needed to hear. He dropped the man onto the ground, stumbling and tripping over himself in terror. Within a few seconds, he was gone, already outside the warehouse, the police ready to show up within the hour.

...

As Batman ran through the dark winter landscape of Gotham, his eye caught on the parking lot sign he passed earlier.

**DO NOT ENTER. PRIVATE PROPERTY. VIOLATORS WILL BE PERSECUTED TO THE FULL EXTENT OF THE LAW.**

He skidded to a stop, transfixed by the sign and his mind focused on the brief story his interogatee had told. His actions already broke the law. Perhaps if he had been born poor, rather than as heir to his family fortune, he would have ended up like the poor pawn inside of the warehouse.

And maybe what he was doing, maybe it wasn't perfectly okay. Maybe his actions, while good intentioned, only reinforced the cycle of crime and poverty. Maybe the struggles he had spent the last year facing had been these people's entire lives.

How far would he go? What laws would he allow himself to break, in order to bring others to justice? If he allowed himself to steal back his fortune, would it be justified in the name of better protecting Gotham? He could rehire Alfred and dedicate 100% of his time preventing crime. He could live as a recluse, in a dedicated Batcave where he could once again monitor the city at large. He could stop eating gross microwave-meat-snacks and sleep in a real bed.

But then.. would he be any better than the criminals trying to make the best of their situation? The poor and desperate who dream of better, leaping over laws in an attempt to achieve them?

He sighed. *I'll think about this later. Scarecrow's my first priority. Plus I have work again in 4 hours.*",Aquason

[WP] An artist mixing paint before his easel suddenly realises he has created a new colour.,askmeaboutmyfootlong,"Upon his easel was a color so rare

that no alchemist’s brew could ever compare

He named it “diversa” this color so bold

then mixed it with others to see what would hold

when mixed with the others all colors did shape

their molecular structure to that of this state

the red did appear as the new color deemed

yellow also succumbed to diversa’s bold dream

blue had no chance and turned right away

and green wobbled a bit and then failed to stay

all colors went diversa without exception

A predictably universal color predilection



He gazed upon his canvas to assess his art

it appeared only one color was there from the start

all others had vanished in diversa’s embrace

devoured so wholly they left not a trace

He mixed in a panic to restore what was lost

but diversa had extracted a villainous cost

All his paints merged together meant none stood apart

He was an artist unable to create any art

This new color he thought was so bright and so bold

was nothing a creator could ever extol

He wept at the art that had gone from all sight

and torching the studio he set the thing right

So when the madness of diversa is discovered anew

get a match, set a fire, it is all one can do",Curiaregis7
[WP] Write a short story based on the lyrics of your favorite song,milesandmilesoftacos,"*""Remember when you had a dream""* Ax dragged her feet, feeling the scorching heat of death around her. Fire licked her skin, yet she didn't burn. It wasn't hot enough to burn her skin, only made her feel warm and sleepy. No. She was going to fight the lure of sleep, she had to find him. She'd been torn apart from everybody she knew, and wasn't going to give up. So close.

*""Remember when you had a heart""* Looking slowly around her, death lay everywhere. Slaughtered, weak, dead bodies surrounded her, flames licking them, bringing the foul smell of burning bodies. Not that it bothered her anyway. Long ago before she had her innocence taken away from her, she might have stayed glued to her spot, shocked by the scene. But not today, she had to see her family and friends. And everyone here was in the way, the ones who'd betrayed her long ago before she even understood what betrayal meant.

*""Remember when it was so simple, this world, my fault, could ever scar?""* Ax remembered the days of childhood spent in another place, another life, another body. She'd been through hell to get back home. To her world. Defying the laws of life and universe, she'd committed the most illegal of her acts so far. Not that it would make much difference to her record, she wanted to see the people most important to her. One downside of that was the one person who meant the most to her would undoubtly be able to see her scars. On her body and soul. The pitfalls of being saved by someone is they can see all of your weaknesses. For a long time she blamed him for putting her in another life, but slowly she learnt that it wasn't his fault, he was just trying to give her another chance, one away from all the chaos that surrounded her ever since she had been born. She wasn't exactly wanted by her family in the first place, especially her father's family. An unmentionable abomination. And then she was kidnapped for her power and potential, which lead to her being forced into a fighting club by her uncle. Yeah, it was a long story.

*""Remember when you fell in love?""* She knew now that she felt love for him. Not in a romantic way at all, but in a father-daughter way. It took her a long time to accept this as she loved him that way very much. After all, he was the one who knew her the most, who fixed her and sent her away for her own good. But not everything was fixed, her mind for one, was a little bit broken.

*""Remember when it fell apart?""* A con of coming back was she retained every single memory of her life before she was sent away into another. And the memories of the life she lived that wasn't actually her life. Someone else's, a different name, different family, different plane of existence, different friends, different body. The most vivid memory she remembered was being captured by him, and ending the second chance she'd been given, the other life that wasn't hers. Sure she'd killed millions, infinite numbers, but this death affected her the most. Because she knew who would be hurt by her departure. Or the other person's departure. See, her mind couldn't quite untwine the two sometimes.

*""Remember when you saw tomorrow of love you swore you'd never start?""* Upon returning home, she'd promised herself she would never return to her old ways of pillaging and killing. But the lure of it all was so tempting. Especially since it was so much easier to wipe out those who had done her wrong. Standing over her uncle's corpse, she felt no remorse. Her other uncle, her aunt's husband had exiled him after finding about his years of deceit and dishonesty to their people, family, and what he did to Ax. Her return had only increased the arguing on both sides of her family, although they were finally talking to each other. And accepting her.

*""But now you're on your own...""* Ax knew things would be hard when she came back home. But she didn't realise that she would be alone in her strife. No one had gone through what she had gone through. So it was even harder for them to relate and understand. Sure, her families were accepting her, she got on with her friends, both new and old. But at the same time, they were all a little fearful of her metamorphosis from pure assassin to the path of redemption, while she'd only grown more world-weary and tougher.

*""Remember that you've fell hard?""* She remembered being stuck in the prison that he was in charge of. She remembered how she lost track of the days and nights, stuck in that special cell for her, the light always on. She remembered her mind losing itself. She remembered breaking out only to be brought right back to that cell. She remembered no one had broken out of that prison before.

*""Remember when you sold your dreams for nothing?""* Ax remembered the pain of the torture she would receive if she didn't win a fight, her uncle losing all the profits of the bets that had been placed on her. She remembered his anger, and the ones who would eventually train her to be an assassin eyeing her up while her uncle tortured her. The tools he used long forgotten. There were too many to remember. Ax kicked her uncle's body away, stepping over a leg and exited the burning warehouse. Outside, one of her old bosses greeted her with a leering grin, a thin white line with a red mouth set into a body darker than a black hole. 

*""I've been thinking about that for so long""* R.M.D stared out the magnificent floor to ceiling window of his office thoughtfully. He'd been alerted to her presence just a few minutes ago, her escape from the world which she had supposedly been safely confined to. He chuckled and shook his head, Moran, his deputy, right hand man, and closest friend had tried to tell him that Ax was too stubborn to be confined to anywhere but R.M.D didn't listen to him, thinking that he knew best. But that was in the early days of his tenure as Supreme Judge, he was only coming out of his youth and into middle age. He had heard her pleas, her cries of wanting to return. She had seen him as a shadow, a sliver of light, a movement out of the corner of her eyes in the world she was supposed to have been confined to. She had heard him talking to her sometimes, but always in the safety of sleep, when she couldn't cry out to him. She had even met with him in a coma state to discuss her return to which he refused and sent her back. And now she was here, announcing her return by killing their common enemies.

*""Keep running up a hill, fight back, don't stop""* Ax watched her old boss's body fall to the ground, a gurgling sound coming from him as he died. No one was going to stand in her way of finding her loved ones. Especially not her enemies. She thought of a swear word and looked at her old boss, as if to say that she would never defect back to her enemies' side. She was on her way to a better life, the life she had been longing for.

*""Don't you throw your hands in the air""* Ax ran towards the strange vehicle that her old boss used. It looked like a diamond cut in half that was floating on it's side. But she never saw the plasma shot that had been fired at her from the right. Blind arrogance. She really was getting closer to seeing him. All she had to do was jump in the vehicle and program it to get to the building where his office was.

*""I'd rather cherish all everything that I own""* The feelings of pure happiness and achievement bubbled inside Ax as she neared the vehicle. She was so grateful to the way things had turned out for her, not exactly how she wanted to come into the world but she couldn't help the fact that she'd woken up in her own body in a warehouse with her worst enemies all taken by surprise. She finally was in the body she'd been longing for.

*""Than dream about something that I never had""* The plasma shot finally hit Ax and she fell to the ground, shocked. She'd let her emotions get the better of her once again. Gasping in shock, she lay paralyzed by the shot. A voice called out into the darkness and Ax heard shocked gasps. Apologies poured out around her but Ax knew that her salvation was short lived. The voice told her that they were going to get help and that she would be safe, but Ax knew that it wasn't going to happen. She could feel herself leaving her home already.

*""But now you're on your own""* Ax woke up, back in her host's body. Internally, she screamed in frustration and anger. Externally, she threw her blanket's off her and got out of bed, ready to go into another day stuck in her mortal hell. 

R.M.D sensed a change in things, Moran rushed into his office calmly and shook his head. ""Not today. Not yet. But sometime, when the time is right, she will come back"". R.M.D said and sat down to discuss the next case to come across his desk.

[WP] Write a short story based on the lyrics of your favorite song,milesandmilesoftacos,"Johnathan Hallows was running as fast as his legs could carry him. He stumbled over the rocky terrain and fallen branches since he could barely see around him. ""Too dark"" He thought to himself as he frantically got back up after the thousandth time he had fallen. It wasn't really that many, but it sure felt that way to Johnathan. Not only was it a starless night, but a dense fog had enveloped the area. Looking in front of him, he could only see about six feet at best. That terrified Hallows even more. Something was chasing him, and he could feel that evil presence behind him was out for blood.  

Hallows didn't know where he was, or how he ended up in this situation. It was all a blank for him. Johnathan broke into a clearing. He was extremely revealed to see his home no to far away. He was in his backyard. This was good news, since safety was just one hundred yards away.

Just as his hopes were raised, however, a whooshing sound came up from behind him. A black mass of smoke raced past, engulfing Johnathan before winding up between him and his beacon of safety. Hallows fell backward, and tried crawling away before he saw the futility in the effort.

A ghostly figure stood in front of him, shrouded in the purest of black. The thing wore a dark cloak and a hood that covered its head. Johnathan didn't know what it was, but he felt like he knew. It was evil itself. He could tell that by looking into the void of blackness were a face might be.

""What are you!?"" Johnathan managed to gasp out. The thing looked at him for a moment. When it finally spoke, the voice was ominous and dark. ""*You should know me.*"" It started a slow walk toward him and continued speaking, ""You should be afraid of me... Pain is the promise I will keep... I am the whisper in the dark... I am the scream when you fall...*""

Jonathan was thoroughly terrified now. He tried to move away, but he found himself frozen in place. The nightmare continued its advance. It continued, ""*You will feel the pain, you’ll see... And I will bring the pain you need.*""

""Stop! Stay back!"" Hallows shouted in a panic. ""I don't want to die!"" The thing stopped when it heard his words. ""*I don't want to kill you, John.*"" It reached up and peeled away the hood, revealing Johnathan's own face. ""*I am you.*""

Johnathan was completely confused now. His mind raced, ""This monster looked like me? No. It said it was me!"" Hallows didn't know what to say. He finally settled on asking his ghostly reflection to elaborate. It responded coldly and without emotion. ""*I have always been with you... Always. I cannot exist without you. Nor can you get rid of me.*"" It started moving toward Johnathan again, slowly and steadily. ""*You have let me do things that you now must answer to.*"" The nightmare that was Johnathan Hallows was upon him now. He let out a scream, just as he felt it enter his soul.

Johnathan awoke sharply out of bed. He was sweating purposefully. The normality of his bedroom was a great comfort to Hallows, and so he breathed a sigh of relief. It was just a dream. Wasn't it?

He looked over to the other side of the bed. His wife was gone. Right. It had been his fault that she left. The guilt of his brief love affair hung on him like a dark cloud. It was a moment of weakness, he knew, but it was enough to break his Caroline's heart. She had been the love of his life, and he ruined it.

Johnathan got up and plodded over to the bathroom. He looked hard and long into the mirror. He hated what he saw there. What he would not give to go back and fix things. It was too late for that now. Too late for everything? He was reminded of his deepening sadness. The gripping depression that would not let go. Perhaps it would never let go unless he were to end his life?

His own thoughts began to fight against that of the ghost in his nightmare. 

""I can’t pay this ransom."" *My love, my enemy.*

""Does any hope remain?"" *I’m swimming in your veins.*

""My love, my enemy."" *Now you can’t escape.*

""I can feel you in my veins."" *The pain is on its way.*

*And now it’s too late.* ""Now I’m letting go.""

*You should’ve run away.* ""I’ll watch you suffocate.""

*Now you can’t escape.*

*I am the dark! and I am awake!*

It became all too real for him at that moment. The nightmare had returned and was right beside him, staring back with malicious intent. ""I should just end this... before I let you hurt anyone else."" Johnathan whispered unwillingly to the apparition. It smiled an eerie grin. The sight chilled Hallows to the bone. Dread seeped into his mind as he pondered how to relieve himself of his own madness.

A glimmer of light seeped through the bedroom window behind him. The nightmare was visibly distressed by this, but it stood unmoving by Johnathan's side. Curious, Hallows ignored the nightmare for the moment, and moved to the window. It was the sunrise. He never had really seen one before.

Johnathan marveled at bright orange and yellow colors that peaked over the tree-tops off in the distance. Maybe this was what he needed? Just as the sun rose to start a brand new day, he too needed something new in his life to wash the darkness away. 

Hallows looked back into his room. The nightmare was gone. Doubts of himself still lingered, but he had hope that he could change. It would take some work, but he would find happiness again.

Life is full of dark and painful times. In those moments, all you can really do is wait for the next sunrise, and let it carry you to a brighter day.

Song lyrics based on Red's ""What You Keep Alive""",GreyWolf035
[WP] Write a short story based on the lyrics of your favorite song,milesandmilesoftacos,"I sat alone on our bed.  She had been gone for over a year and I still felt uncomfortable by her absence.  After so many years of sleeping on one side of the bed or sitting in the same chair at the dinner table I just couldn't get comfortable if I couldn't convince myself that things were the same as before... well, as before she left.  I knew it wasn't going to be much longer until I would follow. The doctor had told me that the tumor was inoperable and that I could expect only just a few months. How long ago was that? Four, five weeks?  I knew I didn't have much longer.  I always thought that when I was this close to death, that I would be ready.  I should be ready.  Ready to no longer be alone.  Ready to see her again.  All I felt was fear.

I sat alone on our bed.  I had become oddly attuned to the beating of my heart since I had visited the doctor.  It seemed to be the only thing I could relate with that accurately expressed by exhaustion.  It felt so tired and yet refused to give out.  I wasn't sure what I was supposed to be doing with what time I had left, but I knew that today something needed to happen.  I couldn't just sit in this dusty room and stare at the old television that didn't even work any more.  Whenever I turned the dial, the screen would fill with static and then fade into a single white circle in the middle of the screen.  I couldn't remember, but I think it had stopped working around the time she left me.

I sat alone on our bed.  Something needed to happen today and I knew what it was.  I had to go see the warehouse.  The place where she would spend so much of her time while she wasn't at home.  She worked as a curator for the local museum.  She spent so much time travelling back and forth, overseeing the transfer of displays between the museum to the storage warehouse. Once a display no longer brought an audience, it would be shipped to the warehouse where it would sit in a wooden crate collecting dust.  Forgotten.  

The upstairs neighbors' kids must have dropped something in the room above where I was sitting. Before I realized it I was on my feet yelling ""Shut up! I'm thinking!"" Not a second passed before the shame and embarrassment of  shouting at the kids upstairs overcame me.  I had to get out. I was tired of feeling forgotten and alone. I was tired of being in this room where the rest of the world was moving by while I sat alone in our bed collecting dust.  Forgotten.

I looked down at myself and realized that I was standing for the first time in days.  I had already overcome the first hurdle, I may as well keep going.  Walking across the room took so much effort, but I was surprised to find that the pain of getting dressed and walking to the bus stop was so much easier than spending another day sitting alone on our bed.  I almost fell climbing the steps to get onto the bus.  I was so embarrassed when the kid behind me had to catch me to prevent me from falling on him.  He wore one of those work uniforms that had his name sewn onto his shirt. ""Thank you, Jared,"" I told him.  He was polite enough to see me to the nearest seat, but I'm sure he was happy to be away from the old man that had nearly fallen on him. I would be.

It would be a long bus ride and that left me time to think about where I was going. The warehouse had always made me feel uneasy.  The longer I thought about my destination, the less sure I was about whether or not I would be able to enter the building.  I couldn't quite place what made me so uncomfortable about it, but I could only spend so much time in there without wanting to run out in a panic.  It was the only place I couldn't follow her.  Oddly enough, through all my panic and apprehension, feeling my own beating heart comforted me.

I brushed the dirt from my suit as I dragged myself out of the cemetery. This was my funeral best? What a joke. Where'd they get this thing? Another dead guy? For Pete's sake.

I walked down the street and was greeted by the horrified stare of a man who was leaning against the wall, smoking a cigarette. ""Hey, friend, could I bum one from you?"" My voice had never been so hoarse. I needed a drink.

He made a panicked noise and dropped his cigarette. He fumbled for a minute, pulling his wallet out and throwing it at me before he took off at a sprint. I picked up his fallen cigarette and took a drag. Fucking menthol. But I suppose beggars can't be choosers. I pocketed his wallet, as my own was gone.

The night sky was a deep red, which was pretty unusual. But then again, I'd just crawled out of my grave, so it wasn't the strangest thing that happened today. I walked over to the window of the shop on the corner, checking my reflection. I look like the hell I just escaped from. As I tried to brush some more dirt from my hair, I noticed something else in the reflection. Not right across the street, but further down the road that crossed it, I could see the lights of my favorite watering hole.

With the cigarette hanging out of my mouth, I quickly checked to see that the street was clear and crossed then followed down the road. There were only a couple cars parked outside. The bar was never busy. Sort of why I liked it. I'd come here with my friends and my wife. We'd close the bar, damn near every night. 'Til my daughter came along a couple weeks before I died, that is.

I could see a couple outside, macking on each other. Reminded me of when I used to sneak away with Lucy to do the same thing. In fact... the girl sorta looked like my Lucy. Same flowing red hair. And the guy... well shit, he looks like my friend Mike. He even wears the same stupid hat Mike always wore.

""Son of a bitch."" The words slipped out as I realized that it was Mike and Lucy outside our favorite bar. ""You motherfucker!"" I howled. The two separated instantly, and looked over at me as I stormed across the street. I made a mistake this time though. I forgot to look both ways.

A semi barreling down the road took me along for the ride, all the way down to the next intersection where the asshole finally stopped. I lay sprawled out on the pavement before it, surprised by otherwise completely unharmed.

""Oh man, oh man, you're a mess,"" I heard the truck driver say. My broken and no longer lit cigarette lay near his feet.

""I was already a mess,"" I growled. I was livid. Shoving him away from me, I pulled myself out from under the truck. 

""Yes, I'd like to report an accident,"" I heard the driver say. I spun around and whipped the phone from his hand before tossing it across the street. ""Hey!"" He shouted angrily. He must have been a hot head too, as he swung first. His truck didn't hurt, I don't know why he thought his fist would.

I hit him back, again, and again. Suddenly he pulled a gun out of his waist band. We wrestled for it. 

I won.

A single shot sounded off in the night, and his blood and brains painted the sidewalk. I tucked the gun in my belt and found his pack of cigarettes in his coat. Damn menthols again. I lit one up anyways. 

Why Lucy? I asked myself as I walked down the road toward the bar. I know I wasn't the best husband, with my temper and the types I hung around with. In and out of jail, and always getting in fights. You always said you didn't care. Then you had our little girl. I promised I'd clean up my act.

They were probably already gone from the bar. Sure enough, I see my unmistakable car tear ass along the cross street, heading toward the cemetery. I stepped into the bar and sat down on a stool. Billy the Bartender stared at me, slackjawed.

""Thought you looked real good at your funeral, Tommy. Usual?"" He finally said.

""Yeah,"" I mumbled.

""You just missed Mike and the missus.""

""I saw."" He set a pint of Guiness and a shot of whiskey on the bar before me. I kicked back the shot and asked, ""How did I die?""

""Uh, well, I found you while opening the bar. You were back in the alley,"" he said jerking his thumb over his shoulder. ""Police said someone took a crowbar to the back of your head.""

""Someone, huh?""

Billy nervously twisted his bar rag in his hands. ""Mike and Lucy have been in here together a lot. I hated to think..."" His voice trailed off.

I sipped from my pint and stared out the window as the sound of police sirens grew closer. The flashing blue and red lights danced across the small pub. They stopped outside. One car, then another. A third. I could hear more on their way.

""Tommy, what did you do?"" Billy asked me quietly. I finished off my pint.

""Not much. Not yet. Thanks for the drink, pal. Might want to get somewhere bullet proof.""

I pulled a cigarette from the stolen pack and lit up before stepping outside.

""Hands on your head! Down on the ground!"" Came the chorus of shouts from the officers.

Grinning and puffing on my cigarette, I looked up at the red sky and let out a howl. I don't know why. Seemed like the thing to do. I know Mike and Lucy heard me. I don't know how. Probably the same reason I came back from the dead and the sky was red. It was just that kind of day.

""Last chance!"" An officer shouted. ""Before we send your ass to hell.""

""Hell already sent me back once.""",mstarrbrannigan
[WP] Write a short story based on the lyrics of your favorite song,milesandmilesoftacos,"[**Dooley-The Dillards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxFYKYm3TPA)  

*Dooley was a good old man  
He lived below the mill  
Dooley had two daughters  
And a forty-gallon still*  

Every small town has their local “character.” You know, the person that is known for being a little wild, a bit eccentric, and might partake in activities that aren’t necessary legal. However, this person is almost always wonderfully nice and will go out of their way to help their fellow neighbor.  

Sam Dooley was our version of that person. Sam’s large family had lived on a remote, mountainous farm along Thunder-Run Creek for generations. Him and his seven children kept to themselves when it pleased them, but were commonly seen in town at the local tavern or farm supply shop.  

Everyone knew that Dooley made moonshine. It wasn’t spoken of too loud, particularly when the revenuers came to town, but Dooley’s corn whiskey was well known across the state. Tom Bardwell, one of Sam’s neighbors, would often joke about seeing fancy Cadillac cars attempting to traverse the Dooley farm’s treacherous driveway, obviously in search of his famous liquor.  

*One gal watched the boiler  
The other watched the spout  
And mama corked the bottles  
And old Dooley fetched 'em out*  

The Dooley still was a family affair. It was where they could be found on most any full-moon night, often playing their well-worn family instruments as a crude bluegrass band. Sam played the Banjo; the only instrument that could convey his rushed nature and sharp personality. Bettyane, Sam’s wife, played the mandolin, with his children rotating between any remaining string instruments commonly played in the Appalachian Mountains.  

*Dooley slippin' up the holler  
Dooley tryin' to make a dollar  
Dooley give me a swaller  
And I'll pay you back someday*  

*The revenuers came for him  
A-slippin' though the woods  
Dooley kept behind them all  
And never lost his goods*  

Sam’s family had always valued self-reliance. Most all of his childhood time was spent in the family woods and this experience gave me a keep sense on his surroundings. He could stalk deer, outpace a coonhound, and trap fox, one of the wiliest creatures known to a woodsman. Dad often claimed that Dooley was the only man that could track an escaped cow through the thick Ohio woods without dogs or radios.  

These skills gave Sam a great advantage against the “revenuers” that would come searching for this still. The dark hollows of southeast Ohio weren’t a place for outsiders to go poking around less they find themselves on the wrong end of a short barrel shotgun. Dooley wasn’t a man to be violent, however, so his still was protected by obscurity and remoteness. Should a government man have made his way up the steep Thunder-Run Creek bottom, he wouldn’t have found Dooley’s still unless he was standing on top of it.  


*Dooley was a trader  
When into town he'd come  
Sugar by the bushel  
And molasses by the ton*  

When the Dooley’s came to town, everyone knew it. They weren’t exactly flashy, but they did stick out compared to the more contemporary farmers. Sam and his children were a bit “rough around the edges” as far as manners and tact were measured. That didn’t bother anyone; it was just how the Dooley’s were. The businessmen that Sam chose to trade with were always a bit miffed when he walked in though.  

Sam was known to drive a hard bargain on items, sometimes paying what he thought was appropriate and leaving regardless of if the owner wanted more. He would simply leave an extra jar of whiskey on the porch step. Pete Walker, our local dry goods retailer, always ended up a bit sideways on those deals because he didn’t drink!  


*Dooley slippin' up the holler  
Dooley tryin' to make a dollar  
Dooley gimme a swaller  
And I'll pay you back someday*  

*I remember very well  
The day old Dooley died  
The women folk weren't sorry  
And the men stood 'round and cried*  

Age never did seem to affect Sam in any detrimental way. His hearing disappeared a couple years back, which led to interesting shouting conversations during his business deals, but he kept on running the still. His actual age was often up for debate anyway because he didn’t know for sure. Birth certificates and social security cards weren’t popular in rural Ohio during the early 20th century. His best guess was sometime in the summer or 1923.  

I like to think that old Dooley was too slippery for even death itself. The thought of Sam outrunning the old reaper through his familiar woods is too comical to forget, but those woods ended up being his demise. A rotten Elm tree near the still found its way to the ground one late fall day, and Dooley happened to be underneath it.  

Dooley and his rugged ways didn’t agree with everyone. The self-proclaimed high-society ladies of town shunned him as a troublemaker and producer of elicit spirits. Sam couldn’t have given a darn if someone had paid him to. He got the last laugh on the subject, however, stating in his will that a large wake be held with free corn whiskey for all.  

*Now Dooley's on the mountain  
He lies there all alone  
They put a jug beside him  
And a barrel for his stone*  

We all figured that Sam would only feel at home in one particular place. This spot was where he spent most of his time. He made something that was enjoyed by all, other than the frustrated revenue agents that spent their career trying to shut him down. They were present at the funeral though, I’d think to pay their respects and admit defeat to the wirey old moonshiner.  

There isn’t much left at the old still site today. Legal alcohol made its way to our county a few years ago and Sam’s children raise corn for cattle rather than whiskey. Dooley’s grave is still there to be found for those who look hard enough; the barrel is slowly rotting away and the jug has cracked.  

*Dooley slippin' up the holler  
Dooley tryin' to make a dollar  
Dooley gimme a swaller  
And I'll pay you back someday  
And I'll pay you back someday*

  The words haunted Brent, as he sat drinking in his normal seat in the local watering hole. Nothing he'd had was strong enough. He had stopped counting his drinks but was dead sober. Images of a shovel flashed in his mind.

  ""What's with that guy"" he heard someone say.

  ""He's a 'lil messed up right now, but he's a good guy. He's pals with that guy that went missing"" whispered the bartender. ""I'd leave him alone tonight""

  ""It's closing time Brent. I'm sorry but you gotta go home now."" The bartender sounded sad Brent thought. ""Want me to call you a cab?""

[WP] Write a short story based on the lyrics of your favorite song,milesandmilesoftacos,"Goddamn this dusty room.

Last light fluttered in through with the wind of a hazy afternoon sun, and I'm breathing in this silence, like never before. I always feel this way when she's on the other side of the threshold; past the point where I can see, but I can still hear. 

The steps and creak of wood, of groaning ply beneath the light stress of human feet.

This feeling that I get... This one last cigarette before I come back in from the couch on the three-season porch; as I lay awake and wait for her to come through that door.


Maybe... maybe, I can share it with her. If I draw slow, bide my time in the shifting winds that filter through the screen. If I resist the urge to finish and be done with this burning paper.

I behave so I can share it with her, as I hum the same old song, in the same old voice. The one she loved, back when she could recall my name; back when she could tell my face from a stranger's.

*You are not alone dear loneliness*

*You forgot but I remember this*

*So stranger, stranger, stranger things have happened I know.*

*I'm not alone dear loneliness*

*I forgot that I remember this*

*So stranger, stranger, stranger things have happened I know.*

""I am,"" the boy mumbled. ""But I thought I heard someone---""  

""Go back to your classes young man!"" Old Bertha then continued struggling to get back up. It was as the boy heard a few moments ago, the lady fell over on the sidewalk. Henry rushed to her side, and gave her a lift with his small hands.  

""Woah! You're a strong one.""  

The boy blushed. ""Glad you're ok ma'am."" Then Henry zoomed back to his classroom.   

Thankfully, no one noticed the fifteen seconds he was absent. Not like anyone expected much of Little Henry, the boy in the corner chair. Little Henry, who struggled with multiplications and keeping pencils steady in his hand without breaking them.  

Little Henry, who could move faster and carry more than anybody. But not like Little Henry knew this. He kept his deeds small and his habits regular. Mostly because everyone underestimated what Little Henry could do. So no one noticed when he was gone from the classroom to help somebody.   

*You'll be a fine young man one day, as long as you eat your vegetables.*  

He almost ate a whole farm once.  

*Brush your teeth.*  

Henry had to mind going too hard, or he'd wear out another toothbrush.  

*Go to bed early so you can get up early.*    

Little Henry tried to sleep. Oh boy, did he try.  

*And learn your multipliers so you can grow up to be a smart young man.*  

That was it! Math! Little Henry buckled down to his desk and started paying better attention to Mrs. Harris. 

Later, he would learn how to be a better hero. Everyone else told him he was too young to start being one. So for now, the boy was determined to learn how to multiply six times four, no matter what.    

Everyone underestimated what Little Henry could do. Even Little Henry himself. But if he ate his vegetables, brushed his teeth, stayed in bed wide awake for eight hours a day and learned his multipliers, he could be great one day. So he did his best to ignore the cries for help in the middle of the night. He would be a better boy, and someday, a better hero. As long as he did what he was told.

[WP] Out of boredom you decide to break the 4th wall like you are on tv. After a week a strange man appears and yells at you to stop doing that.,badatspelilng,"""A strange what?""   

A man, a strange *man* tells Richard to stop breaking the fourth wall like he is on TV. It makes for an unbelievable story that breaks a reader's suspension of disbelief.  

""What suspension of disbelief,"" Richard asks no one in particular. ""It's a fantasy for Christ's sake.""  

The adventurer mumbles to himself while making his way through the woods. Soon, Richard begins to realize the error in his ways, and resumes his search for the Dragon's key.  

""No.""  

It's the story, Richard. Just go with it.  

""I refuse.""  

Don't be difficult, we have a plot to get back on. Richard pushes a branch out of the way---  

""What the hell's a TV anyway?""  

--- and it whacks him in the face. Richard curses at himself for his foolishness and---  

""Fucking shitty ass story smashing me harder than a ---""  

Stop that, this is supposed to be a kid's story!  

""Fuck you, I want out.""  

Richard pleaded to the silent woods for mercy, but only the leaves rustling in the wind responded to his desperate cry. The weight of this quest sat heavily in his chest, with no companion to share this burden with.  

""You killed him off in the second chapter.""  

The adventurer sat on a fallen tree, bemoaning---  

""Yuck, it's got moss all over it.""  

*Bemoaning* the loss of Frederick the Lesser, who would have survived if it weren't for Richard's selfish shortcomings.  

""Reader, be honest with me. The narrator's a bit of a prick isn't he?""  

If only the adventurer found a way to bring back his faithful companion, but knowing he was an asshole who didn't care about the story, he---

""A kid's story huh?""  

Richard *stood*, with resolve in his heart, to finish this quest.  

""To find the nearest tavern and get smashed on mead,"" Richard joked, as he made his way once more in search of the Dragon's key.  

""No, I'm getting a drink."" But Richard wasn't serious.  

""Am too. By the way, the Dragon's key happens to be the best drink in all the three kingdoms.""  

No, wait, that's not what---  

""Alright kids, pay attention, a Dragon's key is two parts Jack Daniels with a shot of---""  

Stop that!  

""C'mooon, the reader wants me to go out and have a good time, as a projection of their own own liking for a good time. Am I right or am I right?""  

Little did Richard remember of the previous two books, of his many heroic deeds and noble tasks, which catered to his audience, who's age happened to range from *10 to 14!*  

""I've been doing this all week,"" Richard whined like a--- ""Knock it off, you're not fooling anyone. This story was getting dull, so I'm just spicing it up.""  

A vision came to Richard.  

""Oh no you don't!""  

Too late, an endless wood ventured out to impossible distances in every direction the adventurer could see. Sorry.  

""Shitty world building if it's nothing but a forest.""  

It seemed impossible to escape. Richard curled up into a pathetic little ball, shaking from the sheer enormity of the---  

""Which way did I enter the woods?""  

... South by South East.  

""Good. That was a two day walk from Telver Town. You can't break continuity. I'm getting a drink.""  

... But to Richard's dismay, there was a large, fire-breathing---  

""Coat rack, that sprayed confetti and gave free drinks to adventurers who got sick of their narrators.""  

No, that doesn't make sense. Richard shook his head to clear his mind, and remembered the large, terrible, fire-breathing---  

""Prostitute, who gave the best services across all the three---""  

Alright, *enough.* What will it take to get Richard the adventurer back to the story in such a way that doesn't break the fourth wall anymore?!  

""You know what.""  

-----------------------------------------

Two men sat in the tavern of Telver Town enjoying two pints of non-alcoholic beverages, preparing to continue their journey.  

""So then,"" the first man said. ""I scaled up the cliff for two days, with nothing but a piece of string and a backpack to sustain me!""    

Richard did not reply to Frederick the Lesser's boasting. Instead, he took another sip, smiling at the stories Fred shared of his impossible survival that led to their reunion.

They were slippery with blood, but the call was too important to wait. I had to make it now.  
Each dial tone was another second too late. Again, the lines were slammed. What was it about September that made it so difficult for them to---  
""911, what's your emergency?""  
Oh thank god.  
""A family of three, no survivors.""  
I hung up.  
They would send an ambulance anyway. That took twenty three seconds on average to send out. Then emergency services would log the fatalities.  
*Three one-thousand, four one-thousand, five one-thousand...*  
I had the doctor's number on my phone.   
*Thir-teen, four-teen, fif-teen...*  
No way would I miss my mark.  
*Twen-ty, twenty-one...*  
Not again.   
*Twenty three.*  
My finger slipped. I hit the red button.   
""SHIT SHIT SHIT!"" My voice carried throughout the house. I punched in the doctor's number again, forcing my hands to cooperate. I begged. I pleaded. Please, a little stability, I had to make it this time! She was waiting for me.  
Oh god, she was still waiting for me.  
The phone began to dial.  
One second too late.  
Two seconds too late.   
Three seconds too---  
""St. Michael's, Doctor Kerovac speaking.""  
""BEGIN THE OPERATION!"" I screamed into the phone.  
Click.  
Good. The doctor moved quickly. Margret was nine days overdue. Time to make my getaway. But first...  

-----------------------------

""George, you made it!""  
My wife looked exhausted. The pregnancy had taken a toll on her, but a small bundle in her arms made it all worth while. Her room was filled with the happiest crying I've ever heard. I joined little Mary from my side chair, enjoying my first day of fatherhood. My clean hands clasped together, holding my chin up to keep both within my sight.   
This had been our third attempt, and the last Margret could handle.   
*How long can she hold out?*  
*Ten days George. We can't hold the fetus in her anymore than that.*   
*It's already been eight.*  
*Yes. A miracle has to happen.*  
So I gave him one. Another miscarriage was avoided. We finally had our daughter, and the timing couldn't have been better. We always wanted a September baby.  
Now I would take on my parental responsibility and guard them with my life. The Anderson's deserved that much for having made this all possible. Whoever the new neighbors would be to replace them, I hope they also liked poker nights.

"[WP] With your writing, show me Freedom.",Goodnewsonlyplease,"Don't let the jail cell fool you. I'm fine with it, really.  
Old bars and granite, that's all this really is. See, I made a choice. A stupid one, but it was mine to make. Here's what I got out of it; Three times a day, I get to eat. Eight hours a night, I get to sleep. My free... my *spare* time goes to classes, books and working out.   
Again, I'm fine with it.  
You want to know how I ended up here. I can see it on your face, that word written all over like a rainy day, and you left your umbrella behind. So there you are, dripping 'freedom' all over my nice clean cell floor, expecting a response. Should I mop that up with a dirty towel, and squeeze it into a cup for later? Do I look desperate to you? Or angry? Or jealous or crazy or...   
No. No I don't mind. I'm fine with it, really.   
Here, I'll make it up to you.           
What I did isn't the important part. When? Too long to count. I stopped asking why after my first year. Only myself to blame on this one, so there's your who. This is hard to talk about, I don't think I can...   
Where. I can tell you where.   
A quiet hometown, three hundred souls wide and a hundred and twenty miles further than it should have been from the largest city. Two blocks from where you could get the best bagels in the state, someone pinned a girl to a brick wall. In an alley, away from streetlights and camera heights. This was a desperate man. An angry, jealous, crazy looking man.  
What choice did I have? Who else could have seen it happen, and, why me?  
Why did I have to walk by that scene?  
So I pulled my gun and shot him.   
Well, damn. Looks like I told you what happened anyway. In hindsight, *I* should have been the one asking what was going on. Turns out they were a couple just looking for a good time, and couldn't wait 'til they got home. Wasn't his fault he wore shitty clothes and didn't know how to shave, the jury would tell me later. Wanna know what I said to her, when she wailed and gawked as red lapped at her sneakers?  
""*Oh.*""  
Did he live? What was my sentence? How much longer will I be here for?    
If you're still asking those questions, you're missing the point.  
See, I made a choice. A stupid one, but it was mine to make. There were many other ways I could have approached that day. Many different streets I could have walked down. I could have waited another hour to get a bagel. In another state, I may not have had my gun, depending on local laws. But no, I went where I pleased, with what I pleased, how I pleased.    
Now, I don't. I'm fine with it, really.   
Because I took a man's life. A shitty, stupid choice, but I wanted to be a hero. Could have been anyone else. A model, a police officer, a junkie... this one time, I also had that word dripping down my face, and in another time, I was drenched by it.  
*I want to be a hero!*  
Old bars and granite don't hold heroes. They hold more poor choices from happening in the wrong place, in the wrong time. Some of them you know instinctively to be bad decisions. Other times, you don't. You make a choice, deciding who you want to be in that moment. To walk on, to stop... to *act.* What would you have done?    
Don't let the jail cell fool you. I'm fine with it, really.  
I'm fine.  
I'm fine.  
I know who I am now. That's what freedom can do for you.  
Use yours wisely, and next time you come to visit, bring an umbrella. That dripping all over the floor... my cell looks nicer without it. Wouldn't you agree?

Now that I've gotten that out of the way, I feel like I can answer your question. It's certainly much more magical to write with the unicorn ink, but I don't feel like it helps my writing.

[WP] The Wolf of Wall Street - Title taken literally,Kiwizoom,"The Wolf Times

Legendary ""The Wolf"" policeman foiled by gang members

*28 March 2016. Our famous wolf policeman, captain of the BGPD (Big Wolves Police Department), let the '3 Little Pigs', a gang of arms dealers, free. He was not able to blow down the brick house of 'Pig 3', also known as Rodney McPorkinson, Russian arms dealer tracked by governments for years. As a result, 'Pig 1' and 'Pig 2' escaped unscathed as well. The Wolf unfortunately suffered burns on his lower body region after falling into Rodney McPorkinson's house. *

-------------

""I screwed up, Ted. I really did."" The Wolf sulked, pushing his hairy head into his hands.

""You did screw up, buddy, but you can change it."" Ted said. The Wolf looked up, curious.

""I heard that Rodney built another house out in the valley. Maybe you can try arresting him again."" 

""But, Ted, I can't blow through brick walls, you know that."" He shook his head, finding the task hopeless.

""You can. Just not now. Come, follow me, bud.""

---------------

The Wolf stood in front of his new nemesis. A brick wall. He eyed it down, trying to judge its movements.

Ted put his hand over The Wolf's shoulder and said, ""This street is full of brick walls like these. Try as hard as you can. Once you finish, you'll be ready to go get Rodney.""

""Ready?""

""Ready.""

The Wolf wasn't going to let the gang get away again. ",bringerofjelly

Chapter 2: Rumble


“Hey Jack, I know you’re nervous. I have something to calm us both down, okay?” Will reached into his backpack, feeling around. He pulled out a compact cassette recorder, and started the track. A familiar tune played softly, muffled by the gunfire. Nonetheless, it calmed Jack significantly. 

“We're going down, down in an earlier round.  And Sugar, we're going down swinging.“ It seemed as if the universe was making a cruel joke. Will chuckled, and went back to fighting. 

He knew it was their last stand, their last chance to make a difference. Amid the terror, Jack found a head and pulled the trigger. A short wave of pride washed over him, followed by horror. The troops were less than 10 feet away. Jack scoped in. His hands trembled with the same viciousness as before, but Jack was unrelenting. Just as he was about to squeeze the trigger, a soft grunt put him off, causing him to miss his shot.

He turned, discovering the origin of the grunt. 

-----------------------
The girl sat in her colorful, peace sign covered room, reading a book. She couldn’t concentrate, the feeling of betrayal still stinging her over and over again. Were all those grocery trips her mother went for all lies? Lies to cover up the man with the eagle tattoo?

“Honey, did you see any money when you were looking for the comb in the drawer?” The high-pitched clipped voice pierced the girl’s ears. 

“I…uh…I…No, of course not.” She tried her best to tell her lie believably. Maybe this was why she failed Drama class. 

“Don’t think I don’t know when you’re lying, Clarice.” Her mother raised her eyebrow and stated in a condescending tone. She continued.

“Are you talking to those bad ‘friends’ of yours again? You know I told you to stop fraternizing with…them. They’re bad influences on you, Clarice.”

Clarice couldn’t believe that her mother could twist the situation just to mention her best friends again. Just because they got bad grades didn’t mean they were bad influences, but her mother didn’t believe that. She was fuming, and with a sudden impulse of anger, Clarice stood up and defended them.

“Don’t “Clarice” me, mother. Even though you refuse to believe that my friends are not bad influences, you aren’t in a place to say anything. The red box told me that you aren’t as perfect as you say you are, mother.” She raised her voice arrogantly, stepping towards her mother with a fierce glint in her eye. Her mother tilted her head, clearly confused about the situation. That was when Clarice knew she messed up.

“I.. mean… I won’t talk to them anymore…” She backed up, sucking in an anxious breath. Clarice wondered if her mother noticed her Freudian slip, looking up at her for any hint of recognition. Just as she was about to give her sigh of relief, she saw it. Her mother’s eyes widened and she paled. She shakily whispered to Clarice.

“You saw it?  How did…” Clarice’s mother’s flashed with anger. She burst out suddenly.  
“You shouldn’t have been looking at it in the first place! It’s my private items, Clarice! I can… I can… You’re grounded for the month! No! The year!”

Clarice retaliated, glaring at her mother, “Well, I know about your little affair, mother! Don’t think I don’t have the guts to tell dad about it, huh?”

Her mother regained the color to her face. She chuckled.

“Wh-what? Why are you laughing?” Clarice furrowed her eyebrows, clearly confused. Her mother cackled, turning away from Clarice.

“If it was an affair, I’d be a much happier woman, honey.” Her mother snarked. Clarice could almost hear the smirk on her face. 

Rumble. Rumble. Rumble.

Just then, the floor became to shake. All the pots and knick-knacks Clarice kept on the shelves of her room began to shuffle to their death. She could feel the insides of her body vibrating. Her mother turned to look at Clarice, shocked look on her face, but there was little any of them could do as the floor cracked beneath them. 

-------------------------

Jack held Will’s shoulders, shaking him. 

“You’re not dying. Stay with me here. Please.” Jack pleaded. Will slouched over, camouflage jacket dark crimson with blood. He took short quick breaths, hand reaching out, almost like he was grasping the tension. Will applied pressure on Jack’s wound, but it did not seem to help much. 

“I can’t… breathe…Please…I’m so cold. I’m cold. My wife… we just got…got married. I’m so cold.” He wheezed, shivering despite the temperature in the tunnel that seemed to only rise. Jack didn’t know what to do.

“You’re going to get through this, Will please.” 

“I’m so cold.” 

“And Sugar, we're going down swinging.”

---------------------
Complete darkness. Rumbling. Still. Panic.

""Help!” She cried out, straining her voice. Please, someone hear me. She desperately searched for a light source, but alas, the rubble had blocked all the sunlight. Keep calm. She closed her eyes and focused on her breathing. Inhale, exhale. Inhale, exhale. She attempted to sit up from her awkward position. Her legs scraped against the ground. As she pushed outwards, her shirt sleeve ripped in half. There was a loud crunching noise. 

“Ah!” A sharp stabbing pain resonated through her entire left leg. It was pinned to the ground by heavy rocks. She winced, tears ran down her cheeks. She tried pushing the rubble away, and hitting her elbows against the debris but they would not budge. Head spinning. Vision blurring.

The sudden thought plagued her whole body. She started hyperventilating, and her body tensed up. It was hard to move. 

“Help me! Help me please! I’m trapped! Please!” She started to shout. In her mind, she knew that it was likely that no one heard her. She couldn’t die here. She wanted to grow up, become a doctor, find true love, make a family, start her own charity organization for the poor, and then die peacefully at night. 

“Mom! Where are you? Please! I love you! I’m sorry! I’m sorry!” She cried angrily, flailing her hands about the small space in frustration. 

“Help!” She tried for the third time. 

Silence.

She didn’t know how long she sat there, but she knew that a God she didn’t believe in had to have heard her cries. Then, Clarice heard her savior. Sirens. They were coming closer. And closer. And closer. She pushed against her confines.

“Help me!”

She heard a loud grunting noise.

Then, light struck her eyes with blinding intensity. Clarice covered her eyes and peeked out. The rubble was moved away and she could see the night sky above her. She noticed that her leg no longer had anything pushing on it. 
 
She was free.

---------------
“It wouldn’t hurt for you to try being a decent father and husband for once. You’ve changed.” The woman with blue eyes and orange hair shook her head, staring at the spaces between the floorboards.

“I have. I’m different. I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I just can’t.” Jack sighed. He ran his fingers through his hair, the stress affecting him. The woman with blue eyes and orange hair looked at him, tearing up. She didn’t protest, only nodded. 

“I love you, Clarry.” Jack looked down at what he was leaving and couldn’t help but feel disgusted with himself. 

-------------------------

She pushed on the rubble beneath her, attempting to stand up. Her leg twisted with a sickening crunch. Clarice winced. She noticed the calloused and meaty hand sticking out in front of her. Taking it, she hopped out, almost tripping. Police and firemen surrounded their house, with blaring sirens and glaring lights. Clarice didn’t even notice being lifted onto a stretcher. She flailed her arms, knocking the oxygen mask away. Clarice continued thrashing in desperation. 

“Where’s mom? Where’s dad? Please save them! She was right here! She was right here!”

As she yelled, straining her bruised lungs, Clarice eyed her savior in the fireman uniform. He made eye contact with her, looking at her in pity. Clarice couldn’t help but notice something in his pocket glinting in the moonlight and a tattoo on his neck.

We’re Going Down

Chapter 1: Dinner

They were dropping like flies. Outnumbered and outgunned. Bullets zipped past his ears, lodging themselves in the bodies of his allies. Loud groans of agony were drowned out by the “bratatat”s of the vile instruments of death. Not a breath of fresh air could be inhaled as the metallic smell of blood filled his nose. The sand in the tunnel was all over the place, kicked up by the torrents and torrents of bullets flying through the air. 

He panicked, struggling to aim at the enemies. The gun controlled his hand, he couldn’t stop it from trembling and shaking. 

""Hey, Jack - right?"" 

Jack turned around, and he saw a big man, 

""Focus. They're just targets, that's all,"" he said. And as Jack looked, he winked and disappeared back behind the sandbags. 

Jack turned his head towards his ally. The man’s eyes had a charming twinkle, yet the blue that they held reminded him more of a puddle than an ocean, he was only able to see the surface and not what lay beneath it. He seemed experienced in combat; Jack assumed two or three tours. His shooting and aim were impeccable, a stark contrast to Jack’s. They dodged under the cover of the sandbags, waiting for the next chance to shoot.

Jack nodded quickly, following the man’s advice. However, his aim did not seem to improve. The more shots he tried to take, the more frustrated he became. Tears welled up in his eyes, and he had to resist the urge to slam his weapon on the ground.

“I’m Will. It’s okay. Don’t get frustrated. The fact that you’re here is enough.” He continued, unusually calm amidst the commotion. 

“Here.” Will pushed something into Jack’s hand. It was a penny. It was dirty and bloodied, but somehow it reassured Jack. 

“It’s my lucky penny. It’s been with me for three tours, kept me lucky. Charlie* won’t know what hit’em.”

--------------------------
The family was happy. They sat at the dining table, chatting and laughing. Some joke about a casserole recipe was being thrown around. The girl was bored, moving the bland food on her plate around with her fork. She heard familiar laughter and took her cue, laughing as believably as she could. She loved her family, but sometimes, well, most of the time, they just weren’t very funny.

“Did you hear about John Lennon’s death a week ago?”

“I did, I’ll miss him. It’s so sad, really. The great artists always die young.” The girl zoned out of the dinner table small talk at this point. She only snapped out of it when her mother called her.

“Darling, can you get the special comb we bought yesterday from my drawer? I want to show your aunt how good it is.” The girl’s mother asked, waving her arms in a dramatic gesture. The girl reluctantly dragged herself up the stairs and into the master bedroom. The forced laughter from downstairs was so loud it made it there.

She shuffled towards the polished oak dressing table her mother used to put on her many layers of make up every day. Pulling open the drawer, the girl heard a strange banging sound, like something was hitting against the inside of the drawer, jamming the drawer closed. She tried to reach inside the drawer, feeling for the uneven bristles of the special comb, but all she ran her fingers along were the smooth metallic surfaces of her mother’s vast array of hair products. She suspected her mother had a hoarding problem; it was as if the numerous anti-aging eye creams had obscured her vision of the number of beauty products she already owned. 

The girl struggled with the drawer, attempting to brute-force her tormentor open. She tugged and winced, and yet her efforts were all in vain. The drawer was not going to budge. She painstakingly removed the beauty products from the open portion of the drawer, and then pushed her hand through a cranny, nudging the items, hoping that the drawer would open. 

And open it did. Unfortunately, as the drawer was pulled open with a nasty “shhhhk” sound, a little red box fell out. The girl soon became curious of the boxes contents. The box seemed to be calling out the girl’s name. She knew it was wrong to look in her mother’s private stash, but it was far too tempting. The girl gravitated towards the temptress. The temptress’ hands reached out, black lace chains pulling her arms towards
her. 

It revealed an old photograph and a ring. The old photograph was black and white, and was of a young woman in her 20s -30s and a man about the same age. They had their hands around each other. The way fiery orange locks danced around the woman’s face, the way the lips curved, resembling a cherry and the way the eyebrows arched gracefully, framing the woman’s face reminded the girl of someone. It was her mother. Her mother looked so much more beautiful back then. Her smile seemed so much more…genuine. The girl used to admire her mother. 

The man was tall, average build. There was nothing popping out at her about his face, but a tattoo on his neck of an upside down eagle was obvious. It was detailed, somehow conspicuous yet humble enough to be missed out at the same time. The black lines did twirls and loops into a majestic eagle head. The eagle’s eyes looked menacing, its stare piercing through the photo-paper. 

The ring was simple. However, it still looked expensive. The elegance of the metal frame holding the crystal clear gem could be compared to the arch of a swan’s neck, and it intrigued her. The ring, the man, the man’s arms around her mother…Suddenly, the girl pieced it all together. How could her mother do such a thing? Her father was the most kind-hearted person she knew and yet… The girl shook her head, it couldn’t be real. 

Ironically enough, the laughter and chat still continued in the dining room. The conversation topic had moved onto an earthquake warning.  

“Darling, can you find the comb?” Her mother called for the girl, then resumed her enthusiastic chat with the girl’s aunt about the new IBM computer they had.  The girl quickly closed the box and put it back in its place. But then she stumbled upon something else, a stack of money. 

Her mother was a housewife; there was no reason for her to have a secret stash of money in her drawer either. There was a lot of cash in the stack, probably about a thousand dollars. She assumed that it was her mother’s emergency fund. The girl nonchalantly took a hundred dollar note and snuck it into her jean pocket. Her mother probably wouldn’t notice anyway. She could use the money to buy that camera which could produce colored photos, the one her father refused to give her for Christmas, and no one would be the wiser. Her heart beat echoed in her head. If her mother saw her doing this, she would be…

After swiftly putting back the stack of money, the girl dashed down the stairs with the comb, head still brimming with questions. What was her mother doing with the money? Who was the man with the eagle tattoo? As she sat back down at the dining table, the girl had more questions and no answers. She couldn’t confront her mother with the newfound information without revealing that she had looked through her items in the drawer.

The girl continued playing with her food, rejecting her aunt’s questions. She glared at her mother, angered by the photograph in the red box. Her mother didn’t take the hint, not even noticing the girl’s harsh stabs at her steak.

----------------------------

Ensuring the penny was safely in his pocket, he prepared to aim. Jack pressed his body to the shoulder piece of the rifle, lowering his head to meet the cheek piece. Focus. He scoped in. He saw more enemies running towards him. They were surrounded. If they ran back through the tunnel, they would be met with an ambush. If he stayed there, the enemies would easily overwhelm them and rest of his company wasn’t doing much to slow them down. Battle cries were uttered as the many enemy troops dashed towards them. 

Only a few of Jack’s company were left standing.

No, actually leaving Vault 111 was his first mistake.

The more he thought about it he shouldn't have even been born. 

Nate had had many close calls and met many a mad person in the wastelands, but these raider were different. More violent, more psychopathic... madder. He'd thought that by this point the whole world had gone crazy but was regaining its sanity. 

Then he met the War Boys.  

They made the raiders in the Commonwealth and the Capitol Wasteland look like Girl Scouts. Pale white skin, tumors growing out of them, convinced that if they die they are awaited in Valhalla, and fanatically devoted to the local warlord in the region. Nate had been sent on a mission by Paladin Dance to investigate a Brotherhood of Steel battalion that had gone missing. They'd given him a suited up Dodge Charger that was built specifically to last in the harsh wasteland in the Midwest. He had found that the BoS battalion had been slaughtered and were hanging from an intimidation tower as a warning from Immorton Tim. 

Then a party of 4 cars appeared and started pursuing him. Nate drove away into the desert but the War Boys followed. They surrounded him, some of the War Boys jumped off their car onto his, Nate shook one of them off, he slammed the car into one of the War rigs causing it to spin out of control and flip over exploding, a War Boy climbed on top of the roof of the car with an exploding spear; Nate pulled out a 10mm Pistol and shot 5 rounds through the roof causing his body to jerk up and fall of the car. 

Nate pulled out his CV radio and shouted, ""Is any one in the area? I need help! Please help me!"" The radio fell out of his hands when a War Rig smashed into his bumper.

*Dammit Nate, you might as well be shouting into the void. I should have brought Piper or Strong with me. This is gonna be it.*

Suddenly, in the distance, an image appeared out of the heat waves. A car. The War Boys surrounding Nate started whooping and hollering, their attention now focused entirely on this mystery car. It was a Falcon with a V8 engine on the hood. 

One of the War Boy's shouted, ""Its him! Its the Road Warrior!""

One of the War Rigs pulled off, to terrified at the sight of the legendary car. Leaving only two Rigs left. Nate braked hard and fell behind them, and watched as they charged head on at the V8. Simultaneously the car crashed through one car, and Nate could see a double barrel shotgun fire out the window and kill the driver of the second one, causing it to spinout of control, flip over and explode as well. 

The V8 slowed down to a stop a few yards in front of Nate's Charger. Nate slowly got out of the car with his hands up. Then out of the V8 a man stepped out. He was dressed in black leathers from top to down, he had a scrappy beard and a sawed off double barrel shotgun holstered on his hip. 

When he spoke he had a thick accent that was hard for Nate to understand at times. 

""What a'ya got ta trade mate?""

""Did you answer my call on the radio?""

""I'm not the hero type mate, and I down't work fur free.""

Nate thought for a moment, then said ""I have some gasoline. I'll give it to you if you tell me your name.""

He paused, ""Just cull me Max, the Road Warrior mate.""

Nate said, ""You can call me Nate, the Sole Survivor friend.""
