[WP] You have been shadowbanned. From life.,232C,"""Hello?"" I called on the busy streets. ""Can anyone hear me?"" 


My voice echoed off of the skyscrapers, the glassy walls repeating my greeting in a mocking chant. Cars rolled by, people walked past, and all of them ignored my plea. 


""Anyone? If this is some kind of prank, it's not funny anymore."" Laughter came from behind me, and I spun on my heels, a smile beginning to spread across my face. But it was only a pair of women chattering away about their new husbands' antics. 

I grabbed the closer one by the shoulder, spinning her until she faced me directly, her blonde hair fluttering behind her head. 

""Listen! Can you hear me?""

The other one stopped as well, but they just kept talking to each other as if they were totally ignorant of the fact that I had interrupted them. I tightened my grip until my fingers dug into her arm, but she never said a word to even acknowledge my existence. No one on the street seemed to notice either, even when I shook her until her perfectly sculpted blonde hair looked like it would more likely belong on a mop than in a shampoo commercial. She just absently scraped hair out of her face, laughing about the wind. I let the woman go, and they both simply continued on as if nothing had happened. 


""O...kay. That isn't normal."" I grimaced. ""What the hell is going on around here?"" 

Suddenly, I was struck with inspiration. If I couldn't get someone to respond to me willingly, then...

I turned off of the sidewalk, and walked into the street. A car came screaming down the road, barreling straight toward me. I flinched, closing my eyes in anticipation of the impact...but it never came.


Nervously, I opened one eye. The car was still there, its bumper nearly touching my leg, but it had stopped dead. The driver yawned, still watching the road, but no matter how long I waited he never even honked his horn. Cars began to pile up behind him, some swerving around the obstruction, until rows and rows of vehicles stretched through the intersection for miles. It was total gridlock, yet not a single driver looked more than mildly annoyed. 


I pounded on the car's hood, my fists bouncing against the metal like a giant drum. ""WHY. WON'T. ANYONE. LISTEN. TO. ME!!"" I yelled, slamming my hands into the car with each word. I struck hard - hard enough to easily dent the thin metal - but the car proved impossible for me to damage. 


I stepped past, and the rows of cars continued on their way as if the stop had been nothing more than a red light. ""Definitely not normal."" I said as I watched them stream by. 

I turned around, and began to run. Faster and faster, I sprinted, trying to get away from everyone. *What does it all mean?*


Before I knew it, my legs had carried me all the way to my apartment. I flung open the door, not bothering to close it behind me, and ran to my computer. 


I had intended to search the internet - hoping Google would tell me I was sick, or had some form of mental problem. But when the screen lit up, I was greeted with a flashing, orange envelope, right over the start menu. 


*Well that's new.* I thought, double clicking it. A window sprang to life, covering the entire screen with a scrawling text.

I shut the computer with a snap, the color draining from my face. 


""What the heck is this all about? My name isn't John! And who the hell are the administrators!?"" 

What the hell was I going to do?

_____________________________________________________

So, where are we going now?

No response.

They'd left the bar and the spirit were now wandering seemingly aimlessly around the campus.

C'mon, cheer up it didn't go that badl-okay yeah it did but-

*What are you doing?*

What do you mean?

*If you actually think I care about any of this, I don't. You're not getting your body back, and if you think your pathetic attempts at mocking me are going to get you anywhere-*

I'm not mock- okay I am but that's honestly just because you're fun to mock. 

The spirit didn't have eyes of its own but Roger still couldn't help but feel it was glowering at him.

Do you have a name?

*???*

I just realized I never asked your name.

*Names are a trivial and small minded concept used exclusively by humans for the soul purpose of isolating and controlling others. My kind does not use them.*

That kinda sucks we gotta decide on one for you.

*What did I just sa-*

I'm thinking Terrence.

*What?!*

Yeah, I like it, definitely fits you.

*You will NOT call me that.*

Sure Terrence. Whatever you say Terrence.

Terrence made a sound something like the sound a frustrated 8 year old would make, Roger imagined.

Look, Terrence.

*If you dare-*

Just shut up and listen for two seconds please?!

It didn't seem sure how to react to that.

Look, okay where was I? Look, I'm gonna be honest for an evil spirit you're... I don't know.... kind of pathetic.

*Really? I'M the path-*

JUST LISTEN. I mean all you've really done since you took over is clean my room and embarrass yourself in front of a girl you like.

Terrence had stopped talking.

I mean, okay, you're kind of an asshole, but I'm kind of getting the feeling that all you REALLY want is to be able to live a normal life. And to do that you're going to need me. I've seen what happens when you're left to your own devices, you have no experience with people or the real world. So I think that, if you could stop being, well, you, for two seconds it would be in both of our best interests if we could work something out.

Roger let out a shaky breath. He waited for it's response, expecting some snarky comment or just more angry yelling, but, surprisingly, Terrence had gone silent. They'd even stopped walking.

Err....

*I'm thinking.*

....Okay.

Roger waited. He wasn't sure how but they'd ended up in some footpath through the forest. It was pretty cold today but birds still tweeted happily in the trees, and now the breeze was picking up bringing-

*I don't trust you.*

Sorry?

*...but you're right. So, you know what? I've decided you win. We'll do it your way. For now at least.*

oh

*don't get any ideas*

I rarely do.

*....heh*

Roger wasn't sure what else to say. They stood there for a while, listening to the sound of birdsong and rustling leaves. Then, all at once, the full implication of what had just transpired hit him.

Haha, yessss, I knew you'd come around!

*Oh God.*

Okay, okay, we need to set some ground rules.

*There ARE no ground rules Roger, I decide what happens and when, YOU have no choice in the-*

Terrence

*-if you think that I'm going to-*

Terrence

*What?!*

With a start, the spirit immediately realized what he'd just said.

Haha, see? I KNEW that name would grow on you.

*Shut up*

I'm telling you Terrence, we're going to be great friends, you wait and see.

[WP] A soldier is in the midst of an apocalypse and he/she is keeping daily logs with a camera.,JMoc1,"Log one: The End.

Is this thing on? Oh it is. Well, log one, the end. It happened so fast, no one could have known. The virus had spread so fast that even the government, with all its money and power, could not stop it. This virus, I don't know how to describe it, but it, makes people rot while they're still alive. They can feel it to. John, one of my squad mates, got infected. We had to lock him outside of the compound. When his flesh started to rot he began screaming and screaming for hours on end. I still remember how his eye was dangling out of his eye socket. Sorry, I just needed to get that off my chest.

We're in a military compound in the Mojave desert. We have around thirty survivors. The general is dead, shot himself in the head after learning that his family died. The people look to us soldiers look up to me for help, considering I'm second in command. The civilians look up to soldiers. Moral isn't doing so good at the moment. I don't feel like talking anymore for the day, I'll talk more tomorrow.

Log 2: No word

We haven't heard anything from the government for awhile. They usually call in for us to give them a status report or some bullshit like that, but today they haven't. There's talk among everyone in the compound about how the government have collapsed or had moved or abandoned us or something. We have around a years worth of supplies here so we should be fine for awhile. 

Log 3:New World

No one has called us in three days. I'm assuming that the government is dead at this point. Some people attacked us yesterday. I sent some men out to check the surrounding area to check for any other survivors. I sent five of my soldiers out, and only two came back. I saw them coming in on a jeep and I saw one of them was bleeding out. 

They had apparently been attacked by some bandits. They were able to get the jump on them. The government has collapsed. We now live in a new world. 

Log 4: Desperation

I don't have a lot of batteries. so I'll have to make this quick. Its been six months since I found any batteries or anything. We're running out of food, and there is twenty people here. We didn't have enough supplies as we thought. We were desperate. When they found food this morning, they ate it all up. They didn't care that Henry, one of the older survivors, was gone. That they knew how low they had sunken too. They just wanted food.

Log 5: I'm sorry

I'm sorry momma. I'm sorry for what we have to do. I'm sorry! I'M SORRY I ATE THE CHILDREN!!! I DIDN'T WANT TOO!!! I WAS JUST SO HUNGREY!!!

Log 6:Last log

There's only nine of us left. We invite people into our compound, promising them that they will be safe. When they sleep, we kill them, cook them, and eat them the next morning. The general would be ashamed to see what we have become, but he's dead and we're alive. I don't want to talk anymore.",ltt22716
[WP] You see the world and how sensitive everyone has become and decide to become a super villain to try and start world war three that way people will see how good they had it.,Jigs_,"‘And how many are you willing to kill for your purpose?’ Ann was angry, but he couldn’t blame her. Things that he had done were atrocious and only sure road in front of him was leading straight to hell.

“As much as I can, dear” Jack finished his whiskey and lit up another cigarette “Their only hope is that either cancer or cirrhosis gets me before i get to them.”

Her face expressed both - disbelief in words she was hearing from a man she knew to be gentle and disgust with what he was doing.

“But it’s not the way to do things!” her eyes became watery and yet she still seemed as strong as she ever was. That was why he loved her. That was why so many years ago he let her go. And that was why he regretted that decision ever since.

“In my case it is. I have two years left and that is by the most optimistic calculations. Most likely by the third wave I’ll be useless chunk of meat somewhere on a hospital bed. That’s when they’ll revolt and get their revenge. You see, I’m not the bad guy, just the one who does what must be done”

“Bullshit! Everything you say is bullshit! You’re just angry at the world and want to take revenge, because you got sick. Don’t try to turn it into some big idea about people complaining and not realising how good they have it! We still have wars. Hundreds of thousands are suffering from war and poverty and you decide that you will fuck up some internet nerds and that will make them see… see what? You’re just bringing more pain! You could have used your resources to help someone, but you choose something to feed your ego!” now she was frustrated. All of her body screamed anger and yet she still sat there not trusting her own ability to change Jacks mind and yet it was the only chance she had.

“You are right.” Jack smiled as he poured himself another glass “I could have helped a lot of people. But would it change much? If you put a homeless man into a house and feed him, does it make him become a successful man? Will he get a job and become one of the functioning members of society? Or will he continue to drink his life away like I do? Neither of us knows. It’s a 50/50 chance. And for me those odds are not enough!
You know what is one of the most motivational feelings? Fear. You will run, fight, claw through the mud until your fingers bleed if there is something that scares you. You will forget how cold your coffee was in the morning, you will forget who offended you, you will not care if somebody is gay, black or disabled. All you will care about is how to get away from that fear. And if you will find people who fear the same, you will stay near them, because they can help you run. And, when there are more and more of you, they will help you fight the fear. And that is what i want. I want them to find a real thing to fight against and something on TV or internet. I want to give them a real challenge for their life. I want to give them fear. I want to be their fear. I want them to come and kill me for I am something to worry about, not comments on some sites! And you will help me.” Jack smiled as he lowered himself deeper into the chair awaiting inevitable question.

“Help you how?” she seemed more confused now than angry.

“You’ll be my nemesis. Every villain needs a hero for he cannot exist without one. And people will need hope as I will progress. They will need a leader. Also, someone will need to catch and kill me. And I’d prefer it would be someone worthy. Someone like you. And I have to say this beforehand - you cannot refuse.”

“And why is that?”

“I got here because I’m better than most of them. And still, you are better than me - if you won’t save them, no one will. I’ll make sure of that. All you have to make sure of is doing everything you can to help them. Not an easy task, I’m sure but that’s how we’ll split this - your road goes to salvation, while mine straight to hell and currently we’re on a crossroad or, to be more precise T-junction. Good luck, Ann. You’ll need it.”

I walk down the Main Street and wait for the blast.
 It's pitiful it's come to this. 
Across the street another group of people are screaming charging down the street waving their signs. To think we couldn't find solutions to our problems of such insignificant nature
There will be peace
The explosives go off with a deafening thunder as it levels 15 blocks of the city
There will be war
To think a war larger than any known to man will be fought for meaningless issues
Across the street people are screaming charging away from the streets dropping their signs.
It's amazing what will come from this.
I stop walking welcoming the shockwave.
Its done.

""Listen, I know you've been doing this for well over thousands of years, but maybe *that* is why you've seen your numbers go down.""

How did he even know the Faustian numbers were down? Wait, how did he even get this appointment?

""Your doing the old one-on-one techniques, the slow pitch, customize for each client. Perfect for your Big Ticket items and the large deals you've made your career with. I get it. I really do. But listen, it's not the middle ages anymore, It's not even the 50's anymore, when hitting the pavement meant *driving* from client to client.""

Hm, it has been a while sense we updated the Damning and Damnation Handbook. He might just have a point. But what does he want?

""Your probably thinking 'What does he want?' Now obviously I could of course use my personal skills as a pitch man and try it your way, in fact that's what you've got me... erm... 'Damned' to right now. Now I've put some thought into this, and think that you've misspent me as a resource. I think what you need is a radical restructuring. Top down. Total. The world is different now. The average client doesn't want one big ticket sale, they want a deal, and a reasonable and memorable payment plan.""

Hm, maybe... he was very good at his job in life. He sold things Large as well as small. Very successfully in fact. The world is different then what it was. Maybe trying to sell to everyone is the way to go.

""What I propose is that instead of having me pounding the pavement, I train your sales force in my techniques, as we restructure your marketing of course, and have each of your near infinite sales people pitching to the entire population a variation of your product.

""Everyone in their places?"" asked the producer, who was lingering by the director, fingering the frame of his glasses nervously.

There was a silence, though some murmured assent, and the lights came on. They shone on a tall and grizzly man, middle aged, with a round face that beseeched kindness.

'Rolling in three...two..one.'

Lucifer stood in another corner. He chose to manifest as black, oscillating coils of smoke.

'Billy Mays here, and have I got a deal for you!' began our Mr. Mays. His eye flickered only briefly to where he could feel Lucifer watching, and his hands gestured to the prop-room behind him.

The prop-room was a deep maroon red, with nothing inside of it save a small table covered in white lattice. Resting on the lattice was a small black box.

'Have you ever wanted to win a bet you've always seemed to lose? Ever wanted that girl you could never have? What about perkier breasts--or,' Mr. Mays laughed, 'Excuse me, a better boyfriend?'

He approached the box and picked it up. Without looking at it, he stomped to the camera and thrust the object into the lens.

'*This* is what you want,' he said emphatically.

'Cut!' cried the assistant director.

Trembling, Mr. Mays withdrew from the camera, stumbling slightly toward the set.

'Good job, Billy,' said a young and attractive German woman. 

She was the assistant producer.

'Thanks,' he said, and tried to smile. 'How much time for break?'

'Oh, it's not a break,' she laughed, putting the tip of her nail in her mouth. She surveyed him. 'We just want to make sure you don't need anything.'

Mr. Mays glanced at the oscillating smoke in the corner of the room.

'N-no, I won't--I don't need anything, Lucy. Thanks. Just a quick breath.'

'No problem!' she chirped, and giggled. 'You're cute when you're nervous. We'll start again in fifteen, alright?'

'Sure,' replied Mr. Mays.",whyawoman

We got to the point where his slicked back hair was a cross between medusa and Macy gray after a shower. 

His eyes would sparkle in a way that you had never seen before. It was like the glow of a far off planet coming near, except backlit by a perpetual loop of an oxyclean commercial. 

""But wait there's more"" dimly flashed in the whites of his satanic stare as he gestured towards the sand filled clock.

I quickly noticed that his hour glass still had residue from a price tag. I suppose the Hawaiian black sand warranted the up charge; $19.99 was fair until you had to buy an $8 bottle of goo gone just to get the sticker off.

"[IP] So strange, What Love Does",Syncs,"I remember when I fell in love for the first time.

It was like everywhere I looked the sun shined brighter and the world seemed happier. My friends , even my family they all tried to warn me about the dangers of this whirlwind love. They said the honey moon stage that's where you shine the brightest and it seems like even the birds chirps seem just a little bit better. That isn't all they said. 

They said anywhere I looked would seem better but what I didn't see is what I held behind me. The darkness lurking behind just enough so that I couldn't catch a glimpse so soon.

I told them they were wrong. He treated me like a princess and I'd never felt so loved in my life. Then I started to get sucked in , I would do anything to make him happy and even as it sucked the life out of me everything was still brighter. What I didn't notice was how the darkness would lurk closer to me with every inch of my being that I was surrendering to him.

I didn't know I should have listened until the darkness had consumed me and there was nothing left to go back to , I was trapped and everything didn't seem so bright anymore.

It's funny how it works like that, that you give away the light in your eyes for someone else's to get brighter. I never realized how its so strange, what love does.",peoplereallyscareme

[WP] You're spouse and best friend are held hostage. You may choose one to live infront of both of them. The one you choose is then killed and you get the other.,RyIock,"I stood there stifly, thinking about my situation carefully. One way or another, I really was going to regret my decision.

""Hurry up,"" the person holding the dearest people in my life grumbled. ""If you take too long, I'll kill you instead, then force these two to feast upon your flesh."" She yanked my best friend's brown hair, who tried to scream but the duct tape on her mouth stopped her.

""Can you please just let these two go? Please?"" I begged on my knees. ""Why would you even do this!? It's not like you'd benefit from this anyway!""

""I certainly won't. If I'm caught by the police, I'll be sentenced to a life's worth in prison. But as for you, you'll certainly thank me later."" Even under her beanie mask, I sensed that her lips formed a malicious grin.

""I...I don't understand...!"" I spluttered in an attempt to sound truthful. However, I knew in my heart that I really wanted one of them gone so I could enjoy the full company of the other. I'm just not sure who.

Patty and I had been friends since kindergarten. She was a great friend, really she was, however she was always protective of me and had a tendency to get jealous easily. She was also somewhat controlling and bossy. I promise that she was still a nice human being though!

In high school, Patty and I sort of drifted away from each other. I hung around with more loud people and Patty made a group of shy bookworms who she could dictate, but we still talked from time to time. I met Francis while hanging out with the loud kids. He was sort of a player, but who wasn't? He found his way into my clueless heart.

At first, it was all harmless flirting, but somehow we actually started talking more. We both fell into the trap known as love, and I guess everything just fell into piece. After finishing college, we both found ourselves in a church saying the vows that bonded us together forever.

Anyways, this was where it all went wrong. Patty went insane, grabbed the wedding cake and proceeded to throw it at Francis. I shrugged it off and licked the bits off cake off my new husband, and everyone cheered. Well, everyone except Patty.

She demanded that I chose between her and Francis. I laughed and said I couldn't choose. After the wedding, I continued to hang out with Patty even if she was a control freak, and I started a family with Francis.

I don't think I was with Patty and Francis at the same time. Patty despised Francis's existence, and Francis wasn't too fond of my crazy friend either.

I know what you're thinking: just kill Patty already!! Trust me, it wasn't just Patty who had flaws. Francis, being the player he is, actually tried to flirt with one of my friends who was still single, Stephanie. I slapped him, of course.

I guess these are the problems you encounter when you're a pushover with a heart full of sympathy. I love Francis, I really do, and Patty will always be my best friend.

""So?"" The woman questioned impatiently. ""Who's going to die today?"" I can't believe she had the nerve to ask it so bluntly. She truly was devious.

I slowly walked up to the woman and took the knife from her hand. My feet moved to Francis's direction, and I kissed him passionately for the last time. I proceeded to do what I had to do, which was stab his back. I watched in regret as crimson red blood trickled from my husband's lifeless corpse.

""That was.. Surprising..."" The woman stated in shock.

Tears formed into my eyes. ""Patty...our friendship...where did it go?""

The woman yanked the duct tape out of Patty's mouth. Patty tried to gather all her emotions, then said, ""I...Why would you give up...love...for...someone as flawed as me...?""

""Because..."" Tears continued to roll down my cheeks. ""I miss what we had. Our friendship was stronger than whatever I had with Francis. I liked him but...I love you.""

The woman untied Patty from the chair that she was on, and Patty hugged me really tight. In my opinion, this was a lot better than my final kiss with Francis.

""You're welcome."" The woman said with little emotion.",pacachii

""You will choose. Time is ticking"" said the masked man.

Kate and Brian knelt in front of me with tears in their eyes. Behind them stood the man with the machete.

""Tick tock"" the man said.

I was shivering. My chest was heavy. It was the father of my son and my best friend of 24 years. 

I caught Brian's eyes for a moment.

Brian and I had planned a long future together. I remembered the day we first met - how his smile filled me with joy. Our first date we had gone to the aquarium and ate by the beach. We married in April in a small ceremony with close friends. Daniel came 11 months after. I cried when I saw Brian hold that tiny bundle for the first time. I could see the love he had for our son. Our life was almost perfect.

I turned to Kate.

Kate and I had been best friends since grade school. Our parents met when we were seven. They married soon after, and I was overjoyed to gain a sister. In our teenage years, she was my guardian, the voice that stood up to our parents. When things at school went south, she was my confidant. She was accomplished after college, and she encouraged me to be the best I could be. Seeing her beautiful family gave me hope for a life worth living; she had two beautiful daughters and a husband who loved her with all his heart. 

She was perfect, and for that I despised her.

Apollo 11 astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong did board their spacecraft, spending over 8 days in total transit to and from lunar orbit. However neither man ever set foot on it's surface. Not because we lacked the technology, nor the fortitude. But because of what really happened during the previous mission two months prior.

 In May of that same year the Apollo 10 crew was completing their ""dress rehearsal"" of the eventual landing, following all the steps the later crew would, up to but excluding, the actual landing itself. However during the final steps of the procedure Apollo 10 encountered a mechanical failure. A sudden and violent micro meteor shower tore into the command module and the crew was forced to touch down on the surface for repairs. The following is the first person account of Apollo 10 commander Gordon Cooper.

The moment the meteors tore through the thin skin of the module I felt panic bubbling up inside of me. The module began to roll violently end over end. I looked to Donn and Edgar they gave me the thumbs up, signifying neither was hurt. I then turned me attention over to the damage and as my training began to assert itself I rose with grim determination from my crash seat and floated carefully across the cramped cabin. The starboard thruster had suffered minor damage, but was unresponsive. I was able to carefully reattach some wiring and restrain the system. It slowly countered the spin and stabilized us. We had a much bigger problem now though. The motors outside the craft responsible for pointing the thruster were not working. We couldn't repair them from inside and we would have no choice but to land on the lunar service and attempt repair there. Command fought back against the idea, but eventually relented when it was clear this was our only option. We would be the first men on the moon...

""Myron, what the hell is this,"" sighed Commander Rogers as he removed his glasses and pinched the bridge of his nose. 

""This is what you asked for, sir!"" replied Myron.  Myron selected an orange crayon to add some finishing touches to the flames he drew on the side of the box.  ""This is the rocket ship you ordered.  This will take us to the moon!""

Commander Rogers' face turned redder than the four plastic cups on the underside of Myron's invention.  The veins bulging out of his neck resembled the yarn used to hold up the flag of the ship which read ""The MyronMobile"". 

""Myron.  We gave you a budget of a hundred MILLION dollars.  And you give us this piece of shit? This is something my three year old son could have made!""

Myron gasped and the crayon dropped from his hand.  ""Sir! With all due respect, how dare you?""

""How dare I?  How dare I?! How dare you waste our time like this!  The Russians will be done building their ship any day now!  A REAL ship, made with REAL parts! And all we have is this arts and crafts project!""

""Sir, I graduated the top of my class at MIT.  I assure you I know what I'm doing.  And if you have a problem with the MyronMobile, you're going to have a problem with me!""  

Myron rolled up his lab coat sleeves to expose his toothpick-like arms.  At that moment, the phone started ringing.  The commander hesitantly picked up.

""Hello, Commander Rogers speaking,"" he answered.  There was nothing but snickering on the other end of the line.  ""Bogdan? Bogdan is this you, you son of a bitch?""

""Hello Commander,"" replied Bogdan.  ""Just wanted to check in on how your rocket was coming along.""  The snickering continued.

The commander glanced over at the MyronMobile and gulped.  

""Its... It's almost done,"" stammered Commander Rogers.  Myron gave the commander a thumbs up.

""Oh, that's great to hear, Sarah!"" jeered Bogdan.  Laughter erupted from the Russian laboratory.  

""Bogdan, I've discussed this with you before!  Stop calling me by my first name!"" shouted the commander.

""Okay, okay.  I apologize.  Listen, we're almost done over here, but we can give you guys one more week to try and catch up.  You're going to need all the help you can get,"" said Bogdan in a mocking tone.  This was followed by even more laughter.  Myron saw tears welling up in his commander's eyes.  At that moment, Myron snatched the phone from Commander Rogers' hands.

""You're the one who's gonna need the extra time!"" barked Myron.  ""Our ship is ready to launch as we speak!""  Myron slammed the phone back on the receiver before Bogdan had a chance to squeeze in another insult.  Myron marched over to the ship and dropped a penny inside the box.

""Myron, just give it up.  It's over.  The Russians won.  Bogdan beat me again.  Bogdan always beats me. We..."" 

Before Commander Rogers had a chance to finish his sentence, the ship started to rumble.  

""Stand back, Commander!"" yelled Myron as he ran for cover.  The commander slowly inched backwards.  Suddenly, with a blinding flash, the MyronMobile shot up from the ground and burst through the ceiling.  With his jaws dropped, the commander stared up at the rocket-made hole in the building.

""Mission accomplished!"" exclaimed Myron.  ""Now call those Russians, and tell them we won!""

Before Commander Rogers had a chance to make the call, he imagined having to show Bogdan the pathetic-looking MyronMobile.  The sound of Bogdan's high-pitched, squealing laughter filled his mind.  

""You know what Myron? I'm just going to call up some movie guys.""

"[WP] NASA faked the moon landing, but not because they didn't go to the moon.",Ssamus,"A Personal Accounting of the Discovery and Effects of the Rosetta Stone:  A Preface to the Ethereal Cleansing

For:  The Department of Historical Acquisitions, New Alexandria College

Author: M. Collins

We succeeded, utterly and terribly, in our attempt to land on the moon.  What was supposed to be a crowning achievement of American exceptional-ism and act as mankind's symbolic first steps onto the galactic stage would poison the minds of all involved and set events in motion that would bear terrible fruit in the ages to come.

While the initial video showed the American people and the world a triumphant Neil Armstrong iterating his famous one giant leap for mankind line, the feed had been heavily edited prior to the 'live' broadcast.  

Only a small, heavily edited sample of the video would ever be released, in reality NASA and the DoD had an extensive file complete with a 1 hour video log of all transmissions to and from the lunar team during their excursion to the moon's surface.  It should be noted that the famous video of Neil Armstrong occurred chronologically as the last thing to be recorded that day.

What follows is the missing piece of the expedition's transmission recordings

""CAPCOM this is tranquility base how copy, over""

""Roger that, CAPCOM are you seeing what we're seeing?""

""Well at least somebody knows what's going on CAPCOM.  We are beginning our decent into the crater now. Over""

""Roger that tranquility base.  Our friend from the airforce has asked if you've noticed anything that my suggest that the cube might be Russian. Over""

""Not as of yet, it's uh, um, bigger than we thought it was.  We're about 15 meters from it now if you can see us on the feed.  No signs of soviet design yet.  Whatever this is, I don't thinks it's Russian. Over"" 

""Tranquility are there any signs at all as to who made this thing, any at all?  Over.""

""Wait one CAPCOM, the cube is covered in dust it appears that the dust is masking something underneath.  Uh, Ok CAPCOM, you're not going to like this, we've got what looks to be chinese characters all over this thing so far.  We're going to clear as much dust off this thing as as we can and get a picture down to you. Over""

""Tranquility this is CAPCOM, say again, Chinese characters?  Please confirm, Over""

""That's affirmative CAPCOM.  You're not going to believe this, but this is incredible, I've never seen anything like it before.  Looks like Chinese, Arabic, and Egyptian hieroglyphics and.... some numbers and other symbols I've never seen before.  It doesn't seem that any one language takes up much more room than any of the others, I, uh, ... I think they all say the same thing CAPCOM.  Over""

""Roger that tranquility, we are getting those images now.  Charlie's getting a linguist over here to hopefully shed some light on this.  Over.""

""Tranquility this is CAPCOM, we've uh, we've got that linguist, Charlie is debriefing her now.  She's saying, well she's saying that these languages are old, as in before the wheel old.  Wait one; she says she is, uh, she is able to piece together a translation it looks like. Over""

""Roger that CAPCOM, what is this damn thing?! Over""

""Tranquility, Charlie just handed me the translation, looks like it reads PLANET; TERRA or TERROR or TEROR or FEAR it's a name, possibly or a noun she's not sure; SPECIFICATION: JAIL or HOLDING or TO HOLD BACK; TYPE: DEATH, she's pretty clear on that one tranquility.  Over""

""Roger that CAPCOM.  Be advised it looks like there is a smaller cube attached to the top the main cube, moving to investigate. ... CAPCOM the smaller cube has dissolved into the main cube somehow, I uh, I think I've activat-""

The video transmission is cut at this point, however audio logs remain from this point until video transmission begins again.  The recorded message played by the cube, aptly dubbed ""the voice"" as it is never heard in the same way by two people as some here a man, some a woman and it speaks in any and all languages at the same time depending native language of the listener even when played back through the audio logs.  No explanation of this phenomena has ever been given, however it was because of the voice that we gave the cube a name, The Rosetta Stone. 

While I cannot say what the voice will say to you, this is what it said to me.

""This world is a death world.  The native flora and fauna are adapted and evolved to kill all that may pose threat.  As such, this planet has been dubbed by the ruling council of our species as a penal planet where we shall send the worst of our race as we as a species begin the next stage of our evolution.  

Here, on this world, we send our murderers, our thieves, our rapists; those who are slaves to their most base of desires and emotions we do willingly cast out of our society here, to this planet, to die, or to live in such a way that they will never rejoin us in the cosmos. 

By ridding ourselves of the corruption that has plagued our species since the dawn of time we shall finally begin our final evolutionary cycle and transcend to the next state of being, whatever that may be.  We are the Ethereal, and this world is a death world.""

-video transmission resumes-

-radio static for several minutes, video depicts what appears to be Neil Armstrong sitting in the dust, helmet hung low-

""Tranquility this is Ronal- shit, I mean this is CAPCOM, are you with us Tranquility? Over""

""Roger, I'm- we'er still here ... I think. Over""

""This is Charlie, we still have a mission to complete.  We're gonna need to make a video that we can broadcast to the American people DO YOU COPY. Over""

-silence-

""Tranquility, I repeat, DO YOU COPY.  OVER""

"" ... Roger that CAPCOM, let me know when we're rolling ...  Over.""

""Tranquility, this is Charlie. You are hot in 5-4-3-2-1-.....""

To their credit, our leaders kept the truth of our origins a secret longer than I thought they would. The Ethereals, wise as they were, had counted on the fact that prehistoric Earth would find a way to kill off their undesirables so that they themselves would not be corrupted with our blood on their hands.  They were, as is evidenced by this paper, grossly and horribly mistaken.

The knowledge of the Ethereal presence in the universe would have a unifying effect on humanity.  We finally had an enemy to fight together, as one race, even if that enemy was still human, or at least was human at one time.  

The lunar landing truly was one small step for man; one giant leap for mankind-  one giant leap that would see our boots firmly planted on the throats of those who had cast us down so many eons ago.  Humanity does not forgive, even if it forgets.

[WP] An autoimmune disorder is when the body's defenses turn on it. Describe a disorder where the unconscious mind turns against the conscious.,genzae,"I woke up on the kitchen floor covered in sweat and blood, and utterly blind. My eyes had been sealed shut. Gingerly, I peeled off the scabs and opened them- even that hurt. Everything hurt. Flesh- my flesh was embedded under by ragged and torn fingernails. And the rash that had started last month was only getting worse. The skin was cracking open, oozing and forming into scabs. I walked- rather, limped to the bathroom and looked in the mirror. Scaly, scabby skin had almost completely covered my face, chest and hands by now. Hands shaking, I probed the deep grooves and scratches that they'd made along the length of my face. Briefly, I considered the doctor again- but I wasn't stupid. No way in fucking hell was I going to let this spread to anyone else. Plus, chances are he wouldn't be able to do anything. Saving mankind from a plague of biblical proportions- there have been worse deaths I figure. And I'm not about to let this kill me- I've had about enough of this shit body. Need to go grab the gasoline for the lawnmore- pour some down the fucking hole for good measure too. But first, some coffee- so I wouldn't collapse.

Shit. I was out- had forgotten about that. Must've been why I ended up falling asleep last night. Or rather, it had woken up. Can't think of that- got fucking work to do. Shoving as much of the leftover grounds into my mouth as I could, I limped outside for the gasoline. Splash some on the carpet, leave a trail to most of the house. Gonna roast your goddamn brains, stupid little fucker. Gonna burn your little nest too. But fuck- I was so goddamn tired. And not just sleepy- it's trying to fucking push me out of my own head. Pure animal hatred- I'd imagine it's what a male bull feels like for a matador. Gotta dump the rest down into the hole- through the splintered rotten floorboards. Really should've just gotten the basement fixed when I first noticed it. 

But no, I just had to fucking put it fucking off until they broke and I fucking fell through. Jesus, the walls on the way down were so fucking slimy. And the air smelled like old shit- really, really old shit. God, that smell. The terrifying minutes I was suspended in the air, arms flailing and failing to grip the walls. And hitting the bottom- waking up outside. Just a nightmare- I thought until seeing the hole again, the first signs of the disease on my skin, and my bloody and bruised arms with which I'd somehow dragged myself out of the house with animal strength. Shit- it's pushing again- I'm not done yet, gotta finish the job. But I'm so fucking tired- I can do this tomorrow, it's not the end of the world. I'll just lay down here for a bit- sleep. It'



When I woke up next, it was completely dark. None of the light switches were working... shit. So I felt my way along walls full of unfamiliar holes, gingerly stepping across whatever was strewn across the floor- until I finally found where I'd left my old flashlight. Thank god, still works. Shit... My house is a fucking disaster. The walls and floor torn to shit, the floor covered with a mixture of shit, blood, insects and dead animals. Mirrors and windows all smashed. Looking at my hands, and feeling my face- It was foreign. My entire body was one giant sore, covered in infected, twisted hairs. In places, you could see where decaying muscles had split the festering flesh, allowing glimpses at rotting black bones. How the fuck am I still alive? Good news is, no longer tired. Bad news? I've got a terrible feeling this is the last time I'll ever wake up again.

So I grab a couple giant gardening buckets from the backyard and fill up at the gas station. The streets are fortunately empty, and the station is self serve. The liquid sloshes into the buckets, which I toss into the back of my truck before driving slowly back across the cracked pavement. Soon, my house is filled with the sweet scent of gasoline fumes. And one bucket I save for last- for that fucking hole. The sun's just starting to peek over the horizon- and I'm starting to feel tired. The thing inside me is about to fucking wake up and push me out for the last time. I'm going to fucking save the world- gonna fucking kill the bastard. My hands fumble with the matches, as I lose control and tip forward into the hole. Just as my vision narrows, as I fall backwards into a sea of darkness within my own mind- I see a small glint of matchlight, falling with me. And I can't imagine in this instant before death- of a final bed more comfortable than the one I've made out of roaring flame.",CrystalMagicChamelon

He was not one of those guys that would sit around trying to find proof of reality being a facade for something bigger. However, every now and then he would find something that, for only moment, completely convinced him reality was fake. Maybe a moment of déjà vu or a feeling that was slightly off. But today, he was convinced and there was no changing his mind.

He looked up at the sky and saw not the white circle he was accustomed to, but rather an error message. In big red letters where the moon should have been was the word ""ERROR"". He looked around and back up at the sky; it was still there. He made sure he was not dreaming and to his horror, he was not. Now he has proof that reality is fake, but he does not want to believe it. He closed his eyes and felt sick to his stomach, but upon reopening them the moon had returned. 

He didn't know what to think. But of course he will share this with no one. That'd be stupid, he must have imagined it. However, he knew it really happened. Instead he decides to go on r/writingprompts and look through the prompts. He found one that he could use to write about reality being fake.

"[CW] Break my heart, without writing about romance or death.",Aevery_,"My older sister stood in front of us in her Army fatigues, an olive-green duffel slung across her shoulders. I knew that thing had to weigh a ton, but she carried it like it was weightless.

I felt my heart twist. It was a sight I was used to, but it hurt more and more each time. Each deployment was somewhere new and exciting for her, and another several months of agony for the rest of us. Would she come home? Would she be able to take me prom dress shopping like she promised? Would she and I sit in the living room eating ice cream out of the carton and watching God-awful chic flicks like we used to?

Would anything ever be the same again?

I was excited for her. After months of trying to find her niche and changing her college major from pre-med to emergency management to paramedic science and back again, she dropped everything to become a combat medic in the Army. She found her calling.

That didn't mean I wanted her to leave me.

We all took turns hugging her, and she hugged me the longest. She and I had always been close. She was my idol, my protector. I was her baby. Even though we were the same height, I was 7 years younger than her and therefore her baby.

Before I could stop myself, I started sobbing in her shoulder while she stroked my hair.

""It's okay,"" she assured me. ""It's okay.""

""Promise you'll come back,"" I begged. I felt her nod solemnly, her chin rubbing against my head.

Ordinarily I wouldn't be so scared...but she was headed to Afghanistan. I knew the likelihood of her not coming back rose and rose with growing tensions overseas. I was terrified for her.

A lot of people ask me how I can handle watching my idol of 18 years risk her life the way she does. I tell them I don't.

As I watched her walk away, waving goodbye to us with the sparkle in her eye that meant she was truly happy, I felt something twist in my gut. I had a bad feeling something was going to go horribly wrong.

A week later, we heard a knock. When I saw my father drop to his knees, I knew my gut had been right.",turtlessayrawr
"[CW] Break my heart, without writing about romance or death.",Aevery_,"The kitchen was quiet. 

I froze at the open door, disconcerted. If there was one thing I knew about my home, it was that the kitchen was never quiet. The tile was always squeaking underfoot, chipped dishes were always clanging against each other, chairs never stopped scraping against the floor, and my mother was always in the center of it, the conductor of a symphony of chaos. 

It was a sight that had stopped many a guest in their tracks. My mother would flick a hand and grab a glass about to topple, say a word and line us up like troops, and extend an arm to pull a child back before they could burn themselves, all in the same moment. Even in the midst of the madness, my mom would greet the guest. A smile and a gesture would seat them, fresh cookies and some chatter would relax them, and brisk confidence tied with unshakable calm would comfort them. Though it all, she would make coffee, wipe counters, and stick band-aids on scrapes and cuts.

Now, though, the room was silent. It had been quieter, I realized, since three of my siblings had moved out, but I'd been too busy with school to notice. Even then, it had never been *silent*. My eyes scanned the room, checking off familiar features: eight battered chairs, one polished table, a restaurant sized fridge, an empty mug on the off-white counter, the answering machine displaying one message, and--my mother sitting on a stool next to it, motionless.

My heart stopped. This wasn't right. I shifted, about to rush to her, when her hand moved. It reached out, touched the answering machine, and pressed play.

""Hi everyone,"" my brother's voice said. It was like a shot in the tiled room. ""Just wanted to check in.""

I knew this message. We'd listened to it a week before as my mom made dinner and us kids set the table.

""I don't have much time, training starts again in an hour and there's a line of guys behind me waiting for the phone."" My mom's hand tightened around the edge of the machine. ""But I figured I'd call, let you know things are going good."" 

There was a pause.

""So, um... hope things are good there too. I'll call next week. Bye.""

Echoes of his voice walked back and forth in the kitchen until they faded away. My mom's shoulders rose and sank in a large sigh. Then, she pressed play again.

I watched her there, a conductor with only a single instrument at hand. She bid it play with her scarred hand, and listened as though its music was the world.

I wanted to run to her, hug her, but I stepped back. I knew my mom, but this was the woman beneath her, and this was the song she played for herself. ",thecoverstory

"[CW] Break my heart, without writing about romance or death.",Aevery_,"""Great time for Aunt Flow to visit."" she thought, frowning.  ""That will make my goddaughters 4th birthday party amazing.""
She loved her goddaughter so much, but it was so hard, sometimes.  Same with her niece and other friends, all announcing pregnancies - most unplanned.
Her baby, had she carried to term, would be about 5 years old now.
Worst part was that they hadn't been able to get pregnant again.  Doctor gave minimal chances, although they were trying everything within their financial means.

5 years...of wanting to feel a baby's first kick in her belly.  Wanting to meet her child and see - would he have his father's eyes and her sense of humor?  Would she have shared her mother's love of books and her father's love of history?

5 years...each month around this date, hoping to avoid her monthly cycle.  Getting excited when she was a day or two late, only to be soul-crushingly disappointed to tears when she felt the first familiar backache and cramps signalling that she would start bleeding soon.

5 years...watching friends and relatives hold their young ones, aching to feel her own child in her arms and have him/her look up with pure trust and adoration.  Having family and strangers alike ask ""When are you going to have kids, anyways?"" like it was so easy.  Being invited to baby showers, and later, birthday parties.  Hearing the lucky parents complain - COMPLAIN - about sleepless nights and sick children, not realizing the blessing of watching a child grow in to a person, with their own hopes, fears, dreams, and desires.

5 years...almost hoping that the craving to be a parent will dissipate, just to avoid the monthly heartache.  Trying to fill the empty gap with things that don't really matter...video games, endless concerts and tv shows - any hobby to avoid the feeling of failure to be a parent.

""Maybe next month.""  she hoped, again.  Steeling herself and drying her eyes, she grabbed her purse and her goddaughter's birthday present and headed out the door. ",Blu_Spirit

[WP] A desert statue. The sand had worn its visage down to a topology of gentle dimples. A lonely sacrifice smouldered at its feet.,Agyriac,"Kaneth knelt at the statue, her eyes closed and her breathing steady. She could feel the individual grains of sand scattering across the rock, each tiny impact pulling a minuscule amount of grit from the hardened features. The shrine was now dilapidated, housing only a single sacrificial pyre and a weathered memorial to Ra'Yegu, the Watcher of Life and Death.

Kaneth looked at the remnants of ash on the altar, the last embers smouldering down to tiny sparks that were quickly whisked away in the breeze. She heard footfalls behind her, and pretended not to notice, sliding the roped bundle from the back of her *yegu* and giving the four-legged animal a reassuring pat on the nose. It whickered, rubbing its lips on her hand, and she was taken back to her childhood for just a moment.

A flash of musty stalls, traders selling overripe, sickly sweet fruit and various bits of herbs and tobacco clouded her senses. She felt the heat press down on her in waves, remembered the panic as a young girl struggling to find her way in a city that paid no mind to those less fortunate. She remembered the man's face, the kindly smile as his eyes locked onto hers in the crowd. She remembered feeling so secure, following him back to his hut.

The sound of a dagger being unsheathed from cloth brought her back to the present with a rush of adrenaline, and her body instantaneously reacted, dodging lithely as a blade whistled through the air where her neck had been only moments before. Her own blade was out on a subconscious whim, and she tested the air with a quick jab before sliding the blade neatly along her attacker's arm, drawing an angry red gash on their flesh. 

As neatly as the knife had been drawn, it fell towards the earth, and she caught it in her opposite hand, rolling backwards and coming up in a defensive crouch with her teeth bared. Her opponent was breathing heavily, his inhalations coming in ragged gasps that kicked up dust from where he was kneeling. He pulled back his hood, and her breath momentarily caught in her throat.

Deno's steel gray eyes locked onto hers, and he whistled, turning his head to spit onto the ground. ""Not bad, Kaneth. You always were better with knives. You always hung out in the shadows, scaling walls and getting in places like a little *rat*."" He spoke the last word with contempt, kicking his foot to emphasize his point. He gestured towards the bundle that lay on the ground next to the yegu, drawing a finger across his throat. ""Why'd you off him?""

""That's for me to know and you to spend an eternity pondering, you *trench-wallowing snake*."" Kaneth made to attempt to disguise the scorn in her voice, and her grip reflexively tightened on the handles of the blades she carried. ""You think you can just walk away from us for years and show back up when it's convenient? You don't have power over me anymore.""

Deno rotated his head from side to side, several pops accompanying a sigh of satisfaction. He reached a hand behind his shoulder, sliding a long, sand-colored blade out of a sheath. Taking a ready stance, he held the point towards Kaneth's throat, grinning. ""I might not be able to overpower you anymore, but I sure will enjoy listening to you beg for your life while I carve you up like a *side of mosak*, you shady bitch!"" He dashed towards her with surprising speed, brandishing the weapon with an air of confidence.

Kaneth backpedaled, catching the first three slashes with counterattacks of her own. No blows were landed, and they pushed away from each other with a grunt, coming back to meet in a series of attacks that sent sparks into the air with every slash. Deno's skill with the blade was better than she had ever remembered, and she felt her body begin to sweat as she parried and dodged for her life. ""Where'd you learn to fight like this, Deno? If you were half as good back when we used to jump houses for coin, *Pari* might not have given you that nose job you got!""

Deno's grip faltered for an instant, his pupils contracting in rage from the mention of Pari. An ugly, twisting scar ran down the bit of his nose that remained, and his face involuntarily twitched. Kaneth capitalized on the opportunity, raking a dagger across his chest, and he howled in pain, launching himself in the opposite direction and falling to one knee in the sand. ""Don't you *ever* speak that name around me again! Pari betrayed us, just like you, and she paid the price!""

Kaneth shook her head. ""You're wrong, Deno. I'm not a traitor. I'm as loyal to Ra'Yegu as always. It's you and *Vyku* who have delusions that you're better than the Watcher.""

Deno grunted, pulling himself up and wiping the blood from his hands across his tunic in an ugly crimson smear. ""Delusions? Vyku was going to ascend to heights reserved for those in the stories, and all you had to do was keep your fat mouth shut, and you might have joined him! So what if it cost us the lives of a few of our brothers and sisters? The Blood is always paid, in the End. So goes the Creed-""

""So doeth the Watchers. Don't quote the Oath to me as though I've forgotten it, you *slag*. I swore it just as you did. The Blood is always paid, true. But Ra'Yegu does not take innocents, only those who have condemned themselves through murder, greed, avarice. You know this!"" Kaneth spit in his direction, her face twisted in a snarl. ""And you would spill the blood of those who have done no wrong to further your own selfish needs. That's why you'll die, just like Vyku did.""

Deno's eyes widened, and his nostrils flared as he screamed. ""You know nothing of what you speak, Kaneth! The *Eldenia* have foretold for generations that a Savior would come to bring our people to the Ivory Gates, and challenge the very power of Ra'Yegu himself to gain dominion to the *Realm of the Everlasting*! All hearts are filled with greed, with avarice, with the lust for sin, and all must be punished!"" He leaned forward into his charge, swinging his blade wildly.

Kaneth deftly moved between the slashes, purposefully keeping her parries on the left and right sides, knowing Deno's growing desperation. She continued to throw insults at him, feeding the inferno that was his emotions. ""You know Vyku begged for his life before I slit his throat. He cried, and soiled his undergarments, and I laughed while he bled out."" 

Deno howled at the sky, the sound reverberating through the entire shrine, above the howling of the wind and the echoes of steel on steel. He pulled short of one parry, feinting and coming downwards with a savage cut meant to rend flesh and bone alike. ""I'll laugh while I pull out your insides and make you wear them! Die!""

Kaneth crossed her daggers in an X-shape, catching the blade neatly and throwing it to the side. Combined with Deno's aggressive momentum, the tip of the sword slid into the ground, wedging itself. Deno only had time for a single attempt to pull the blade free before a single clean slice opened his neck from ear to ear. A hot fountain of blood erupted from his neck, and his dying words were lost in the wet gurgling that bubbled from his lips. 

His eyes rolled back, the light in them dimming, and his body soon ceased to twitch, the sword holding him up as a final act of mercy. She watched him bleed as well, a macabre puppet that was forever in suspended animation as transgression for his sins. Gathering up his body, she placed it on the pyre, along with Vyku and their weapons. She knelt in front of the roaring blaze, eyes open and filled with tears.

""I bring you these souls, Great Ra'Yegu. As I have watched them in Life, you now watch them in Death. Carry them to their resting place, be it eternal peace or damnation. Accept me as your Servant, body and spirit. The Blood is always paid, in the End. So goes the Creed, so doeth the Watchers."" She sat cross-legged in front of the fire, one hand on each knee, and felt the small tremors of power coursing through her body.

She felt them each time she returned to the shrine, each time she offered a body to the Watcher. If she focused hard enough, she even swore she could see a small trace of mist gathering around her. She knew she was being prepared, but for what she did not know. Perhaps the Savior would come soon, and he would attempt to usurp the power of Ra'Yegu for himself. Perhaps more brothers and sisters would follow in Vyku's footsteps, creating false Idols as the Harbingers of Deception.

She raised her eyes to the skies, scarlet streaks flashing across her vision as the tremors faded to a feeling of clean burning vigor. Whatever was coming, whatever she might face in the end...she would be ready.",Illseraec

The finer the grind the stronger the taste of the coffee, too loose and it'll taste like piss*I start grinding out a few test beans to show him, grinding the beans at a steady pace to demonstrate.*""You'd want it so that when you pinch it forms like a small clump in the middle""* 

*""So to make two cups of coffee for You and Bella, grind about 15 grams of ground coffee. The scale's in the cubbard right there""* He rummages around the top cubbard and grabs the scale *"" Yeah that one, be careful with the thing, that cost me 30 quid from Amazon.*""

*""Anyways, so the third thing is the Portafilter""* 

*Oh you mean the double spout thing with the handle on the side right?*

*""Yes, that one. Anyways, pour the coffee from the grinder into the filter. Now, here's another really important bit. You have to grab this little thing here""* I grab a small tamper from the drawer*""And you got to tamp the coffee down into the filter, just don't do it too hard*""  I hand him the portafilter with some crap starbucks blend poured into it so he can get a feel for it.

*So after I grind the coffee beans, I place them in here and press it like this?*

Damn he actually got it? Huh so much for underestimating him. I gues this actually might work.

*""A little bit too hard but yeah, overall you did good!""*

*""Now for the final step, just put the portafilter here, grab two espresso cups and press button that has the double cups on it, You don't need to set the pressure setting and all that bollocks since I bought a better machine that has auto settings last month*"" 

He was able to pull two espresso shots nicely, which was surprising since Starbucks blends are known to have a burnt taste.

*""Not bad Dave, not bad. Now, if she wants to have a* **Cappucino** just grab one of the bigger cups from the cubbard, pour in some milk, use the milk frother on it til a nice foam and then pour the shot intp the cup and Voila! An Italian **Cappucino**

*Nice! I'm gonna Ace this. Cheers mate, Now I gotta go dress up, she'll be here in an hour and a half and I got to take a shower*

*""No problem, I'm heading off to Cammy's place for movie night so tell me how it goes yeah?'*I grab my coat and start heading out the door.

*Yeah sure no problem*

**3 Hours Later**

I couple of knocks later and I'm greeted by Dave at the door, of course the knob's smiling from ear to ear and I was able to take a quick glance of some lipstick smudged at the end of his collar. Lucky git. *""I'm gonna assume that you got lucky and she loved it?*

*Yeah she loved it loads!, Apparently I'm the ""Best"" guy in the world because I made her feel like she was back home in Flower-ence or whatever*

*"" It's called Florence you arse""* I sighed, how this man has a well-cultured intelligent foreign girl is still beyond me. *""Anyways did you follow my instructions to the letter? Did you do everything properly?*""

*Yeah I did everything perfectly, Grind, Tamp and all that. I wasn't able to find the cofee beans and all so I  used something different by the way. But don't worry it was really good, it even had Gold written on the label so it must be like one of the best*

Huh, I didn't know I had a coffee blend with Gold in it's name. Probably was one of the extra stock I had in the cubbard that I didn't notice. *""Well that's news to me, so do you remember the full name of it? I might use it next time if it was that good""*

*Yeah it was called Nescafe gold or something like that. Must've been some real top quality coffee, she loved it so much!*

The clueless bastard grinded, tamped and pulled a shot of instant coffee in my machine... and the Italian girl even said it was perfect. The poxy coffee was just instant coffee mixed with water. 

I sighed *""A Match made in heaven you two are""* one cluelless dumbarse to another.

There is really no trick to it, you will need water. Don't ask me where you can get the water from or how water was made, or how much of it is there. Just find some and heat it with fire. Use a match to start the fire, don't try and make it with two stones, or by steadily holding a magnifying glass under the sun for hours. Then you will need a spoon. Please find one, trying to make one will take years of unearthing metals, and then you may realize that making a wooden one would have taken a couple hours. So preferably find a spoon, to stir.

[WP] Everest is larger by far; but this mountain is the hardest to climb.,Ezombio,"""One...Two...One...Two..."" I chanted along with my steps, the rhythm in tune with my labored breathing. It had been days of fast-paced, dangerous hiking, but I couldn't let up. Not just yet. 

""Almost...there...WHOA!"" I dove out of the way, flattening myself to the wall as yet another boulder screamed down the narrow path. I flinched as it grazed my nose, my hiding place just a bit too shallow for comfort. 

""That...was close..."" I panted. I rested for a moment, trying to catch my breath as I eyed the peak that was just a few tens of meters above me. The path twisted now, curling upwards until it was almost vertical. I steeled myself, and trudged onward. Soon, I was climbing as much as hiking, using jutting spurs of stone and sturdy brush to pull myself ever higher. 


I reached toward a likely hand-hold - a shallow looking hole in the rocky face - and gave a yell as something pushed my hand away. A long, sticky, tongue-like tendril undulated out of the wall, nearly making me let go out of shock. 


""Shoo! Get away!"" I yelled, swatting at the thing with my free hand. Immediately it struck back, connecting with lashing blows that felt as heavy as a baseball bat. More of the things began to emerge, from everywhere on either side of the path. I cursed, eyes flicking from one tentacle to the next, and pressed onwards as quickly as I could. 

I gasped under the hailstorm of blows that bludgeoned my back as I climbed. I had expected resistance, it was true, but this was nearly more than I could handle. The tendrils beat me senseless, grasping my hands and feet in an attempt to unseat me, but I had gone too far to be stopped now. 

Bruised and gasping for air, I pulled myself over the edge of the cliff and onto a flat platform and out of the tentacles' reach. I watched as they pulled themselves back into their caverns, pulling small stones with them to cover their hideouts until the path looked as innocuous as before. 

*Hardly a pleasant welcome* I thought, nursing my aching body. I stood at the very peak of the mountain, a vast, rocky flat-topped triangle that stood alone on an endless plain. I gazed down, enjoying the view for a moment. I stopped short, however, when I spotted a lumpy shadow in the distance. It was an encampment of men, barbarians who threatened to overwhelm our village. Thick, oily smoke poured forth from their fires, befouling the air as much as their malodorous presence.


The mountain shook, sending a shower of pebbles down the path behind me. ""No time to rest!"" I spat. Turning around, I ran towards the center of the flattened peak at a full sprint. Spying what I was looking for - a dark, well-like cave right at the center of the clearing - I dove towards it feet-first and slid into the depths of the mountain. 


I don't know how long I fell. The inside of the tunnel was smooth, free from rocks and plantlife alike. It was slick as well - it seemed to be covered in a film of slime. It felt more like sliding down an enormous throat than anything else. I shivered at the thought. Perhaps it was my imagination, perhaps it was the friction of the walls on my leather clothes, but it began to feel as if I was slowly getting warmer despite the wind that whipped past my face in the dark. 


Right when I thought the tunnel would never end, I felt the direction I was sliding shift slightly. Like a water slide, it curled until it was parallel with the ground, and suddenly I skidded hard into something soft. With dismay, I found that the thing was wet and spongy, like a giant tongue


The walls of the tunnel rumbled again. Careful not to slip, I stood up. A faint greenish light seemed to glow from all around me, as if the walls themselves had been painted with phosphorus long ago. I seemed to be in a circular, doughnut-shaped chamber, barely ten feet across. A dome of glowing slime arced above my head, made of the same fleshy material as before. 


No one still living could prepare me for what I had to do next. Groping my way around the pillar that had served to cushion my fall, I slid through waste-deep slime until I found what I was looking for. It was a grisly sight: a man, old and grizzled with age, seemed to be embedded in the wall. His hands, feet, and head were all buried in the spongy material, with several thick bands like tendons stretching across his back to hold him in place. I tugged gently at his shoulder, and they suddenly released him, letting him fall backwards into the sludge. He didn't move. 


""So long, old man."" I whispered, my voice dampened by the walls. I bowed to him with the reverence he deserved. ""You gave up so much, for our sake, but now your time is over. May your spirit be at peace."" The chamber began to shake softly, beating like a heart as the fluid drained, taking the body with it. Quickly, I jumped to the wall, fitting my hands and feet where his had been moments before. I took a deep breath, like a swimmer before a dive, and plunged my head into the hole. 

Darkness enveloped me, cloying and complete. For several long seconds, I held myself in place, gagging at the stench of bile and death that burned my nostrils. Just as I was about to pull back to get another breath, I felt something move behind me. My body was suddenly pushed even deeper into the wall, held snugly in place by the same tendrils that had bound the man before. I coughed as the wall constricted around my head, creating a seal, and the hole began to fill with foul-smelling liquid. I panicked, struggling at my bonds as it threatened to rise above my mouth and nose. I felt hot liquid pour down my back, and I knew it was filling the chamber behind me as well. For a moment, I couldn't breath, couldn't see. I was certain I would die. Then all at once, I felt a tendril push it's way down my throat, and suddenly I could breath once more.  


Outside, the mountain shook. Man-sized boulders, resting in place for generations, were released down the steep sides of the mountain like water pouring from the side of a table after a glass had been overturned. Within me, something stirred, and all at once I was wrestling for control with an unseen entity within my very mind. Flashes of pain erupted from behind my eyes like red lighting, eroding away at my consciousness as the being threatened to overwhelm me. Then, suddenly, it was subdued. 

I commanded my eyes to open. Around the periphery of my back, thousands of lids leapt to obey my will. Coal-black plates, with irises like jeweled flowers of every hue, were suddenly opened to the world. They assaulted my mind with visions of the beauty and color like I had never imagined. Green, blue, and red took a back seat to dozens of other colors the like of which I had never seen. Shapes, like unseen spirits, wafted past my peaks and crags like clouds, and I knew the world was filled with beings the likes of which mankind had never known. I moved, and stone shifted to obey. I stood, and the entire mountain lifted itself from the earth, suspended by my four vasts legs. 

""Speak!"" Called a small voice. I opened two of my eyes, the largest on my frame. They were easily as long across as four men standing, with scleras dark as midnight. A man stood before me, and after a moment, I recognized him: the village elder in full battle gear, beard blowing in the wind, brandishing a torch in one hand and a sword in the other. 

""Who are you? Jarsha? Or some foul beast, arisen to devour our village?"" He was a large man, and before he would have seemed most intimidating, especially with the crowd of villagers rallying behind him. Now, however, his words seemed as important as a fly.


Within me, a small voice whispered. *Kill him.* With a mental flick, I knocked the voice away. 


I opened my beak, and with a gust like a hurricane I spoke: *""It is I, Jarsha, who now commands this being. Your village is safe.""* The crowd of people cheered, the noise sounding as if it came from a great distance. *""What is your command?*""


""Go forth, Jarsha!"" The Elder cried. ""Protect the village from all who wish her harm, and smite our enemies!"" 


*Such a small wish.* I thought. I had so much power now, such a thing was trivial. Nearly beneath me. 


*""Your wish is granted.""* I spoke. I took a step, shaking the earth beneath my bulk. Slowly, like a continent in motion, I turned my massive form until my head was facing East, in the direction the army camped. *So few...so helpless...* I thought. The had broken from their cookfires, scattering like ants. *I will be done with them soon.* a thousand mouths on my underbelly snapped and drooled at the thought. 


*And then, I will return for you.* 


I mentally shook myself, horrified with the thought. Worse still, I did not know where it came from.


 The beast, or me.

"[WP] A Short Story Titled ""Panic"" , ""A Sheer Moment Of Madness"" Or Story About Or involving a Tattered Coat.",Forde93,"""Panic"" by Kyle Grey

The rain dripped down the window on another rainy day in Philadelphia. I put my leather jacket on and grabbed by umbrella. I thought I looked good today, strong even. I was headed out to meet a couple of friends before work. It was morning,  but my job starts late because I have to close up the building at the end of the day. I walked down into the street after taking 3 flights of stairs down. My fitbit seemed happy with me. It flipped on and counted my steps and stairs. The clouds above were heavy, but not dark. They had a content but eerie feel to them. The bustling buildings around me seemed to escape from my mind as I started to think about the day ahead. I had a hard meeting today. I had to present, and my social anxiety was bad as always. I had had it since my dad got murdered when I was 7. Social anxiety, panic attacks, you name it, I had it. It messed me up, but I put on a thick skin in public. It protects me from harm, or it tries. ""Hey Sam."" I heard a couple of feet away, but by the time my mind faded away from my thoughts into reality, he was gone. Whoever it was. I glanced up, and pulled my bag over my shoulder stepping into the starbucks on the end of a block near my apartment. I got the coffee like normal. I sat down and all was well. I took out my notebook and started writing. It's just a normal morning ritual, something that keeps me calm. I look up because my coffee is ready and I see someone I vaguely recognize out of the corner of my eye. I'm 24 now, and I've met a lot of people in my life. You tend to forget many that you really should remember, but then I saw the tattered jacket and I knew who it was. It was Daniel Connelly, my dad's murderer. I saw everything first hand. My mom went out to go with some friends that night and I was left alone with my dad. He came into my room and told me to stay calm. Someone was in our house. He went out to call 911, told me not to come, but I came running after him because I was scared. I stopped in my tracks when I saw him. The tattered jacket my dad wore that day got stripped away from his body. Then the murderer picked my dad up by his shirt and put the gun on his temple. He wasn't even pleading, like he was suspecting it. That scared me the most out of everything. He shot him and blood spurred everywhere. The murderer just laughed and left. I waited until I knew he was gone, and then I just cried. My dad was already gone, with every piece of advice and story he had to tell me in my future years. I went to my room and cried and cried and cried. In the coffee shop the man with the tattered jacket, Daniel, ordered coffee like normal. I knew it was him. My dad's jacket had an emblem on the back. It was him, and there was no denying it. I started to shake, my heart started racing. Telltale signs of a panic attack. I ran out of that starbucks as quickly as possible. I canceled the plans I had with friends. I didn't even call in sick to work. I was too exhausted from the day's endeavors. I just sat on my bed the entire day, just like I did when I was a little boy. It just so happened that tattered jacket was the only thing I would have gotten from my dad. We were poor, and at that point we didn't even have enough money for just one picture. And now that tattered jacket was staring right at me. Engraved in my mind forever...",mylifeisgreyscale

I also subtly mentioned it when I showed how his body was 'better' when he worked on fixing his spacecraft, how he didn't need to drink, how any wounds he got would slowly heal themselves, how the computer was able to communicate with himself in the first place, etc.

At the end, when the computer does the big reveal, I didn't make the twist very grounded or explicit. Our hero doesn't think that he was created from the vats, because there was so much that would be unexplained if he actually was, like how did he know English for example, when every system in his ship used English? And other little things. He decided that the computer must have been trying to just distract him with the lie, so that Ingstin could get at him.

It was a remnant idea of the Japanese destroyers back on the original Earth. I'd never seen it's predecessors but said they said it was the biggest ship on the blue oceans of Earth.

See, back in Orion, we didn't have blue oceans. Just ships light enough to float the methane seas.

Sagiri was the home of every human born after the incident on Earth, 2085. 

We don't talk about that anymore.

She was a marvel of human endurance. We never had contact with aliens until we made the first transport ships to escape Earth. Funny thing about fighting in space that you don't see in the old movies is, rockets and bullets don't work well in the void, that is, the space outside of space. Each Galaxy has a unique way of handling the physics of it, just think of it as different atmosphere or different air.

Those rockets don't fly as well in Orion like they did in the Way.

So that's why Sagiri exists, she generates her own atmosphere. If we find a hostile planet on the way across the cosmos, we just... plow through it.

I exercise in the morning darkness, warming my blood and loosening my muscles.  I stretch and meditate, clean my body with heated water and crushed mint leaves.  
I eat eggs from the coop.    

Cleansed and fed, aware and invigorated I turn my focus to my tools.  The ancient blade is removed from its place above the lintel, pulled from its scabbard.  Inch by inch I inspect the steel for any minute imperfection.  I draw the stone along the blade, listening for changes in the sound.  I lightly oil the blade, and replace it in its sheath.  I dress myself with great care, ensuring my sash knots are perfect and square, that the cowl sits just so, the boots gleam with polish.    
My appearance must equal my skill, those who would hire me would not have it any other way.    
I choose to walk to the square, as on any day, no one hawks their wares as I pass the stalls, no pickpocket thinks to lighten my load.  I have not touched, nor been touched by another human in many, many years.  
I can hear the noise of the crowd in the square as I move through the alleys and through the small, unremarkable door, that opens into the back of a guardhouse.  The room is empty save for a rough hewn table and chairs.  A bag of coin sits in the center of the table in the half dark of the closed room.  I heft the velvet satchel, bite one of the coins, and replace it on the table.

I stand and let the glare pass, allowing the gathered townsfolk to stare.  On the high scaffolding the condemned man kneels, his fate assured.  I will be quick, and it will be a clean death for him.  He has paid me well to perform this task.  Not all in my line of work know the pride with which I perform my duties.  Hatchet weilders and knot makers.  Men without mercy or skill.

""Rick Nelsnop?"" The demon asked, in a raspy voice.

""Yes, that's me. By the way, what happened to this place?"" Rick looked around at the barren, scorching landscape.

""Uh, too many people have died. Satan's had to make some cuts around here. That's why there are so many demons living on the streets these days. By the way, welcome to hell."" He coughed. ""Right this way sir.""

Rick followed the demon, who was clearly sick. He led him to a torturing room. Lots of the machines were broken however.

""Try the electric chair, sir."" Rick sat down on the electric chair. The demon flipped the switch. Nothing happened. 

""The darn thing must be out of batteries. The flame torture might work."" Rick stepped down. The demon tried to light a match. It didn't work. Countless others failed, until the matchbox was empty.

""Do you like the sound of clanking pots and pans?"" The demon asked desperately.

""Sure, they're not bad.""

""I guess we can throw you in the bottomless pit, then."" Even the demon seemed to fear this.

Rick was scared of falling for all eternity. It would be boring, but he guessed this was the point of Hell.

They reached the pit. ""Okay, then."" The demon pushed him. When Rick looked up, he saw the demon sadly putting his head in his hands. 'For a demon, I guess he wasn't that fierce,' Rick thought. His first thought in thinking for all eternity. He thought he must deserve it.

An announcement was made all over Hell. ""Attention! Because of overpopulation, all people who only committed lesser sins will be sent to heaven."" Rick felt himself being lifted. He guessed selling illegal computers wasn't the worst crime in the world.",Brizzel_The_Lizard
[WP] Humanity finally detects a signal from extraterrestrials. The message consists of a single word.,Suentun,"You know, I used to dream about space when I was a kid. Fantasizing about what could out there. Those kinds of thoughts were pretty normal back then, considering the start of the space age. I remember watching the first Hermes launch and asking my parents why the aliens were so rude. We put a lot of effort into contacting them, the least they could do answer back. They never answered my questions. 

When the fourth launch came around, I had already given up hope. My interests had moved to girls, sports, my bed, and college. In that order. I was actually with a girl during that fourth and final launch. Anna Conley. Even after all these years, she is still the sweetest girl I have ever known. We were laying on the hood of her car on the fields near Bear Lake, looking at each other and the stars. We were fortunate enough to have a clear sky, and Anna swore she saw the Hermes IV soaring across the beyond. I knew it was just a plane, but at that time, I would have agreed with anything she would say. 

The car radio was broadcasting the launch in full detail, and had set up a connection with the Hermes crew. At some point, one of the crew members must have jokingly sent out their first message into the unknown. We were a bit preoccupied and didn’t hear his message, but we sure as hell heard the response. It’s carved into my memory, just like it’s carved into the memory of anyone who heard it. One word changed all of our lives that day. 

**Hide.**

A voice. An unquestionably human voice. I remember Anna and myself freezing up, and looking at each other. She was about to say something, but I cut her off. In complete silence, we waited for a reaction from the Hermes. They were even more shocked than we were. You could hear it in their voices when they asked the voice for confirmation. You could hear the static increase, which indicated the voice was about to speak again. But it never did. All we had was that brief moment of static. The voice was there, and then it wasn’t. Then it slowly dawned on me: by warning us, the voice had failed to follow its own advice. 

Ten minutes later, Anna and I were in the bunker underneath her father’s house. Just the two of us, along with enough canned food to last us multiple lifetimes and a barely functioning radio. We hid, like we were told to do. And the world hid with us.",Swagiano

[WP] Humanity finally detects a signal from extraterrestrials. The message consists of a single word.,Suentun,"""E.T. Phone Earth!"" the banners declared as news of the discovery went out around the world. The signal itself had almost been missed. That area of the sky was not even scheduled to be monitored that night but an error in the programing had stopped the intended movement from occuring. When the data was examined the following morning it was almost discarded in anger before the spike was noticed. It wasn't much, barely louder than the background radiation, but it was definitely there. Too consistent, varied and measured to be anything but intentional. The announcement was made, setience existed somewhere else in the universe, we were not alone. 

The scientists reacted first, every telescope on and off the earth was immediately trained on the area of sky that the signal had originated from. In fact all equipment that could be directed that way was, if any other signal was coming we needed to ensure we captured it. Every country in the world contributed scientists in an effort to help decipher the mysterious signal. What did it say? What was the content of the first contact we had ever had with a sentience that didn't originate from Earth? The world held its breath. Meanwhile, the space race was restarted with even more vigour than it was in the golden era of the 60's. This vigour was fuelled by a common rather than cross purpose this time, with countries sharing resources and knowledge freely for the new cause of spreading humanity throughout the galaxy spawning a new golden age of space exploration. 

Speculation in the media was wild and inconsistent, as it usually is. Every half discovery was reported as established fact as they cashed in on the worlds newfound enthusiasm for anything space related. The various religions of the world either declared the news false, mistaken, overblown or a sign of the impending the apocalypse in a desperate attempt to maintain their own relevance as the general public became more and more ambilvalent towards their gods.

The information we had about this new planet, home to fellow travellers of the universe, slowly grew. The planet was roughly earth shaped and orbited a sun roughly the size of our own. As the similarities grew the media started calling this planet Earth II, and the name stuck. Earth II was found to have plenty of liquid water in earth like oceans and an atmosphere that could very possibly be breathable to humans. There were even signs that pointed to satellites orbiting the planet in much the same way that we have on Earth, implying a civilisation at least as advanced as our own. It was not long before the public was demanding expeditions to this planet were arranged, it wasn't far they cried, a mere 340 light years away! Certainly not too far when we could meet aliens in the flesh! The excitement was truely reaching fever pitch on every corner of Earth. 


The supernova could be seen in the sky for 3 days. 

Earth mourned for it's lost brethren of Earth II. Then Earth moved on. But the scientists continued to work tirelessly (though with greatly reduced funding) to decipher the last desperate signal flung out by species who quite possibly knew its own demise was imminent. 3 years after the supernova they announced that the first and last communication that humanity ever received from that unknowable sentience was a single word.

This, here, with the technicians and engineers who had  staffed the observation array that detected the coded signal that had arrived from the stars, was to be the first announcement of what message had ridden those EM waves so very, very far.

Dr. Weyland cleared his throat. “Ladies, gentlemen, scientists all. I’ll get to the point. Tam has the preliminary report as to the signal structure and modulation. Hang onto that. We’ll be using it again pretty soon.” Scattered clapping. “Well, then. The signal is just one symbol, over and over. And that symbol…is forty.”

Silence.

“Is that the key for further encrypted messages?” someone suggested.

“We have no reason to believe that,” said Dr. Weyland.

“Is it a threat?” said someone else.

“Most threats are more actionable than ‘forty,’” said Dr. Weyland. “Now, the linked question, and the one I want us to discuss before this news goes public, is this: what do we transmit in return?”

“What are the odds there’ll be somebody listening by the time it gets there?”

“Can we afford to be that pessimistic?” 

“If they want to speak in numbers,” said an excited technician, “we should talk back. Universal language!”

“A list of primes,” said someone else.

“The Fibonacci sequence!” said another.

“A table of logarithms!”

“Pi…to the fortieth digit!”

Dr. Cho in the back stirred. It was the gentlemanly sort of stirring that instantly drew everyone’s attention, despite being executed in near-total silence.

“Two,” said Dr. Cho.

“Forty…two,” said Dr. Weyland.”As in the answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything?” Dr. Cho nodded.  No one else argued. “Well, that’s it, friends – time to get this out the door!”

[WP] Humanity finally detects a signal from extraterrestrials. The message consists of a single word.,Suentun,"As he lay in bed, going over again the eternal puzzle of that signal he wondered what his grandparents thought. It was so faint then they could determine whether or not it was travelling in the general direction of the Milky Way. They now knew that it was. Speculation is that it was travelling to Earth. Evidence and logic certainly support this. There was no doubt that whatever was transmitting the signal was doing so deliberately towards Earth. There was that seven month gap where it stopped, about five years back now? The doomsayers went berserk over that one. But it reappeared, on the predicted trajectory, at the predicted strength. They still couldn't say exactly how far away it was, nor could they pinpoint an object as the source. The rational minds suggested this meant that it was a non natural occurring body, propelled under its own power, and still too distant to be seen by the instruments of Earth, despite the massive advances in technology to look out into the vastness. After the installation of satellites around Mars, everyone was sure they would see it. But no luck. None of the probes that had been sent out for the last fifty years have reached a distance to detect an object either. The signal grew proportionately stronger but the factor by which indicated not only speeds that seemed to be incredibly slow, relatively, but unfathomable distance. The doomsayers who watch too much Sci Fi claptrap go bonkers on the message board with their theories of invisible aliens conducting experiments. And the religious zealots and cultists claim that a diety of one form or another are speaking to us. Whether that be benevolent, benign, or evil incarnate depends on the board you visit. And we still don't know what it means. 

For generations the signal has grown closer. For generations it's been a part of human society. It's been hundreds of years since it was discovered and still, mankind cannot decipher it's meaning, or tell themselves where it comes from. It's been 'translated' countless times with absolutely no surety as to the accuracy because in no human language does it make sense. No alphabet, no application of tonal identity, no numbers, nothing seems to make sense. It was originally thought to be a mathematical code as it was represented in a series of numbers at first recording but they now understand that the numbers assigned were due to limitations in understanding and recording of data. It has been, all these hundreds of, approaching a thousand years, indecipherable. Religions have changed because of the signal. Religions have been born because of it. Science has advanced in search of an answer. Mankind's reach surpassed the solar system and is now advancing along the arm of the galaxy. Manned craft can now travel successfully as far a Jupiter, and return. The people who go do not return and those that do must live in orbit of the Earth, because they cannot abide the gravity, but this signal spurred the colonisation of space. It gave man a reason to explore. We have become so distracted by everything else we are finding out there that the message has lost its importance. There are still people working on making sense of it. And of course we continue to track it, in the hope that we can find the source. 

The headlines all read some variation of the same thing. The source! It's been discovered! After nearly three thousand years, we have an object from which the signal is being transmitted. The chaos the news created was horrific. Millions died in the riots. The space born have taken hostage the facilities they inhabit and are no longer transmitting data back to Earth. We've lost our eyes and ears beyond what we can see from our equipment planetside. After centuries of being able to see so far, we feel blind. Communication has become tedious and difficult without the satellites orbiting the planet. Mobile communication and data is useless, and we are reduced to try g to repair three thousand year old copper lines. It's not so bad if you're trying to get information on the same landmass, but trying to communicate overseas has proved challenging. How the hell they managed to do this in the 20th century is beyond anyone but a historian. The fact that putting printed data on a plane to physically hand it over is sometimes more reliable than electronic transfer of the data is insanity. But with the civil unrest that has been constant these last twenty years, it is reality. We have yet to receive an answer from the space born, but we are hoping this most recent treaty will be the one that gets us our satellites back. They've been without planetside resources for a quarter century, it's fairly obvious they don't need home,and since they can't live here, they hold all the cards. Between the civil unrest and the reliance the planet has spent centuries putting into the resources of minerals and elements from extra-planetary resources, we can no longer afford to send envoys, only to be met by destruction. We feel as though we've returned to the stone age. 

Everyone and everything is dead, or gone. When we launched that first satellite everyone was prepared for fireworks that never came. It was quickly followed by three probes. The moon has been abandoned. We will have people on the ground there in a few months time. But all the video recorded from the probe that landed the moonwalker and from the moonwalker itself shows no life, no activity. Nothing. Moonwalker can't get inside the compound, but all power is is seemingly gone and there is zero visible activity. We can see the vessel transmitting The Signal. It's... Odd. Asymmetrical and... Incredibly large it seems. Initial scans from the one deep space probe we sent in search of the Space Born identify alloys we found in the outer arm of the Milky Way, but in trace amounts compared to the rest of it. It's indescribably really, constructed mostly of materials we have no knowledge of and we can make no sense of the design. It appears inorganic. Angles and curves that twist the eye and leave a bad taste in your mouth. There is absolutely no sign of the Space Born as far as we can tell. They are just... Gone. 

We have it. The Signal. The Space Born managed to decipher it. It is a single word. I'm unsure of the meaning, or why it was sent. The craft transmitting it is still coming. They won't release the information to the public, for fear of panic. We still don't know what happened to the space born but we've recovered much of what we lost technology wise in the last decade, we are venturing forth again, reclaiming what we once had. It seems that the Space Born have had the message since they cut contact.

Oh, the message? 

It is ""Oblivion"". ",sovexing

"[WP] In a cold, monotone world, you are a (stand-up comedian, comedy writer, etc.)",asomosa,"I walked into 3229 Queen Charles Hall, carrying a suitcase filled with clothing that was too tight, a large box wrapped in Christmas wrapping paper (although it was August) with the words ""ONLY TO BE OPENED BY BRAYDEN ON THE FIRST NIGHT OF COLLEGE"" in big, black Sharpie, and a lamp shade. After attempting to stalk my new, random roommate online and discovering that she did not exist, at least digitally, I was eager to meet her and gauge our potential roommate experience. The first thing my eyes captured as I entered the mundane dorm room was her mundane bedspread, hairstyle, rug color, aroma, voice. I welcomed her with a bright smile and only received a faint quirk of the upper lip and a slight wave that could have easily been mistaken as a twitch. If first impressions could be a smell, my impression of her would be Clorox. If it could be a sense of touch, it would be when your bare feet walk on a tile floor in the middle of a death-threating cold winter. If it was an experience, it would be when you drive away from McDonald's at 3:43 A.M on the way to the beach in a mini-van stuffed to the rim with crying children and umbrellas with 5 hours  to go as your mother frantically passes out fries and burgers to everyone and you realize that you are exactly one burger and fry short and it was YOUR order that didn't make the final cut. Basically, I felt a lot of disappointment and lack of enthusiasm for the upcoming semester. 

I, a college freshman, felt somewhat comical in unpacking my belongings next to my roommate which reminded my of a condiment-less hotdog, or in other words, bland. I was ever so careful in dissecting my suitcase because of the handle of cheap vodka that I had stuffed into my thongs and bras. I most definitely did not want to think about unpacking the ""gift"" that I had actually wrapped myself, making it seem like it was from my boyfriend at the time, that I had filled with more alcohol, a ball gag, and a bowl because those were definitely on the college supplies list. I was no comedian, but I felt like I was about to make a fool out of myself this semester with the roommate I was paired with. 

The entire first week of college, I tried to lighten the mood by offering nerdy puns and jokes. She didn't laugh. I partially blamed it on myself for a failed delivery, I tend to be better at offering anti-jokes. We were just two different people, living in two different worlds, but sharing one dorm room. Two different hot dogs sharing the same bun. Me, a fresh quarter-pound frank filled with mustard and ketchup and cheese and chili, and her, a 7/11 plain dog that has been rolling on that hot-dog roller, that looks like it hasn't been cleaned in like 7 years, for days. 

Even when I was drunk and stumbling back to the room on the weekends, I would try to do something funny with my drunken confidence to make her at least smile and everytime I was a failure. My effort was going to waste. Maybe plain dogs were the new style. Was I trying too hard?

During the last week of the semester, we finally had a heart-to-heart conversation about our feelings about summer, our classes, grades, and thoughts on the semester. I had failed to make her laugh in this boring dorm room, but I felt accomplished in at least getting to know her in a non-hotdog or Clorox-like way. She had even gotten a boyfriend during the semester and had given me the room to myself for the last Friday night of the first year of college. Feeling accomplished and excited, I set out to do what my dorm room had initially been meant for...something crazy. 

A blurred memory induced by tequila shots leaves my only memories of the night of me face first in another girl's vagina with a guy taking off his clothes on my bed when the door suddenly started to giggle. My roommate, paralyzed by first glance, dropped her keys and immediately exited the room. Me, drunk, naked, and afraid, thought the best thing to do was to play dead, as if there wasn't another naked girl right in front of me. 

The next morning, she knocked on the door to regain entry into the hotdog bun saying her final words to me of the semester: ""I guess you really did find yourself this semester...in another girl's vagina."" 

I guess she got the last laugh.

"[WP] Sometimes, the weakest link is the whole chain.",asomosa,"Inja gazed out across the wide expanse of mountaintops and rolling hills that comprised the region of Vard. Tall marble spires rose into the sky like hungry fingers, curling at sloping angles toward the clouds. He took a deep breath of the clean air, exhaling and shaking his head. A sight like this would please any mortal, and yet sweeping his eyes across the panoply of nature left him feeling surprisingly empty.

He narrowed his vision, squinting, and his view was suddenly magnified, pulling him over narrow valleys and sparse plains. A group of soldiers were lined up on opposite sides of the battlefield, the earth pitted and hollow from where they had marched. Gleaming armor and tall poles topped with battle standards hung freely in the midday breeze, and the tension was so palpable it could almost be heard. Young men swallowed nervously, the look of fear plain in their eyes as each one considered whether his nation was worth giving his life.

Inja's ears tingled, and he turned his visage to a command tent, viewing a man whose hands were clasped in prayer. Various snatches of conversation reached his ears, exultant praise quite frequent among the list of requests. He cleared his throat, chuckling as the praying stopped, and a startled gasp issued from the mouth of the man. Inja pulled his vision back to normal, feeling his body vibrate as he materialized in the tent, albeit at a much smaller man-sized scale.

""Y-you have answered my prayers, mighty Battlemaster!"" The man fell to his knees, his palms spread flat on the ground as he prostrated himself. ""I am not worthy to gaze upon your divine presence. Please, I beg of you, turn away! I would not gaze into the eyes of the Omnipotent, for fear I would be destroyed!""

Inja chuckled, idly checking his surroundings as he spread his arms, gently lifting the man from the ground despite his pleas and whimpers. ""Nonsense. I come to you in your time of need, on the eve of a great battle the likes of which will change one of your histories forever. What name do you go by in these lands of Vard?""

The man cleared his throat, his voice meek. ""I go by Tulaf, Oh Great One."" He bowed at the waist again, and Inja clicked his tongue, sliding a finger under Tulaf's chin and lifting him up.

""Enough with the reverence, Tulaf. I understand I am your god, but please; One must not spend their entire life in reverence. There will be time for respects to be paid, proving you are worthy to support my cause."" He paced around the tent as he spoke.

Tulaf quivered briefly, straightening himself and nodding. ""As you wish. May I...may I call you Inja, or is there another name you would prefer, My Lord?"" His eyes widened in horror, and he smacked himself on the forehead. ""I almost forgot; how rude of me! Could I interest you in a refreshment of some sort?"" 

Inja cracked his knuckles, waving a hand. ""Inja is fine, Tulaf. Yes, I would like some wine, if you have it.""

Tulaf smiled, pulling two cups from a gilded chest and walking over to a small cauldron hanging over a fire. ""I hope My Lord is acceptant of hypocras.""

Inja licked his lips at the mention of spiced wine, and he clapped his hands once in joy. ""Absolutely, Tulaf! Let us sit and enjoy the comforts of warm wine and conversation, shall we?"" He placed himself in a chair across from his new acquaintance, gratefully accepting a glass of drink and taking a large mouthful.

""So."" Tulaf seated himself, taking a pull from his cup and fixing his eyes on Inja with a mix of wonderment and curiosity. ""What brings a god from his seat in the high heavens to a simple mortal like myself? Have I been tasked with divine providence?""

Inja laughed. ""I wouldn't call it that. In the grand scheme of things, a man with as much power as myself would normally exert influence through others, instead of directly intervening. But I must admit, your exultations piqued my interest, so I came down personally to see who you were.""

Tulaf leaned back, his forehead creasing with thought. ""When you say you exerted influence instead of being direct..."" He pursed his lips, taking a drink. ""I...wouldn't using other people to intervene still be a method of intervention? Or am I missing a piece of the puzzle?""

Inja steepled his fingers in front of his mouth, the goblet momentarily floating of its own accord as he thought. ""You may be onto something, although I'd be inclined to disagree, Tulaf."" He finished his drink, waving a finger and bringing another stream of hypocras through the air to splash gracefully into his cup.

Tulaf hesitated for a moment, looking at the ground before speaking. ""Please don't smite me for this, Inja, but I do believe that using other people to reinforce your will is still a method of servitude.""

Inja shook a finger. ""It still achieves my desired result, so how would it matter which way I went about influence?""

Tulaf drank and sighed. ""I think you're missing the point, Inja. Why would you interfere with people instead of letting them run the show?""

Inja ran his tongue across his lips, blowing air out of his puffed cheeks. ""Why wouldn't I? I created the world, didn't I? Doesn't that mean that I should be able to have some fun?""

Tulaf grunted. ""I mean, who's to stop you? You're a god. But don't you ever think about how different things could be if you didn't influence them? If you just let them take their natural course?""

""I am the natural course! I built all that you see in Vard and beyond. If I let my creations run wild, with no supervision, what would become of them?"" Inja leaned back, harumphing as he took another gulp of wine.

""Who knows? They could form their own societies, their own ideas. They could establish new boundaries, test their own limits. Only..."" Tulaf grinned. ""Only you know what they'd be capable of.""

Inja raised an eyebrow, considering the possibility. ""I would know what they'd be capable of, since I do know everything. And that would be..."" His eyes widened as he realized there was an anomaly in his planning. Inja possessed no knowledge of what would happen if he deviated from his circumstances. He took in several deep breaths, looking around the room and attempting to mask his discomfort.

""Starting to see what might happen if you let humanity make their own choices and worship who they wish?"" Tulaf refilled his cup and sat back down, crossing one leg across his knee. 

Inja let his thoughts drift lazily about. It wouldn't be too hard to let people run amok. He could continue to make smaller persuasions to start out with, to wean himself off of his frequent advisory adventures. He would be a presence that would be felt, not seen. He could give praise to the people through gentle manipulation of their fates based upon the amount of praise he is given. Tulaf was right. People could only improve if given the opportunity to fall.

""I see it now."" Inja's eyes widened with clarity, and he stood, giving Tulaf a small bow. ""You have broadened my insight on the subject. Would you like to stay by my side, continuing to offer advice where I might require it?""

Tulaf shook his head, his eyes full of regret. ""I could not, Inja. I am not worthy of such an honor. But we will always be connected, you and I. Do not forget the most important thing about man: We are only as strong as the weakest link. And sometimes...""

Inja flashed Tulaf a wide-mouthed grin. ""The weakest link is the whole chain. If you are connected to me, then you are part of the chain, my friend. I insist that you come along for the journey. You can show me where my influence may be most needed."" He waved a hand in front of Tulaf's eyes, and they both began to rise into the air.

Tulaf stammered for a moment, twisting to the side as though to search for a way out of his current predicament. ""You used my words against me. Am I being manipulated as we speak? This goes against the very meaning of what we spoke about, Inja! I will not be a puppet! I have my own will, and I will use it as I see fit, you know! My children will know of..."" 

His voice grew quiet as they rose higher into the skies of Vard, and he stayed quiet until he finally took his seat next to the Throne of Time, gazing out at the battlefield where only hours before he had been casually discussing the finer points of servitude with a God. 

""Beautiful, is it not?"" Inja drummed his fingers on the arm of his throne, returning his view to the armies charging at each other. He pointed to the commanders of each. ""Which one of these would be more fruitful to support? Would the outcome of the battle be best decided by Divine Intervention, or should we let Fate decide?""

Tulaf cracked his knuckles, leaning back and feeling the cool stone of his throne leech the worries away from him. ""I say let's give Fate her turn. She's been waiting for ages, eh?"" 

And thus the One became Two, who eventually became Four, the Guardians of Vard for all Eternity. Through peace, gentility, and a kind hand, they guided the succession of Man through the ages, ensuring that the newly established ""free will"" would govern the actions of those to come for generations.",Illseraec
Story about someone going insane without realizing it [WP],astyhim,"“I wake up at the same time every morning whether I want to or not.” Frank said. 

“It’s something to do with my rhythm, it’s like clockwork after all these years.” He added.

I tried my best to make out the words over the loud humming of the machines, but most of it was lost to me. 

“That’s real good Frank!” I yelled back at him. 

I looked back at my station in hopes that I wouldn’t hear any attempts at the muffled continuation of our fruitless conversation. With a little luck, Frank would  walk back to his station and stay there, silently for the rest of my shift. I was about to put my ear muffs back on when I heard another voice. 

“Do you have a second to chat upstairs?” 

For a second, I wasn’t sure where the voice came from. It didn’t sound like Frank, but I was sure there was no one near me a second ago. I turned back around and to my surprise, saw the floor manager standing right in front of me. He waited for a moment for me to respond. 

“Can I borrow you for a second, upstairs!” He shouted with his hands cupped over his mouth. 

I set my ear muffs down and nodded. 

'What could this guy possibly want with me?' I thought to myself.  

They claim keeping me on my machine is always so important; they make us watch movies about group-productivity and whatever-else. Hell, I have to ask three different people for clearance to take an unscheduled piss. Right up, that is, until they need to and cut my hours again or ask me if I slapped someone’s ass on my way into work. He led me up to the office, which was situated above the floor. To my surprise, we walked straight into the back office. The big man’s chair. 

“Wait here, he’ll be here in a minute.” The floor manager told me as he left the room and closed the door with a plastic sounding thud. 

This entire place is built like shit. Everything was broken, there were barely any windows, and the decorating consisted of grey concrete, yellow walls, and the growing, uneasy feeling of malice. The door behind me creaks open as the boss himself and two security guards enter the tiny room. The big man, the only person within twenty miles who wears a suit to work, walks past me, slaps a manila folder on the desk and sits down in front of me. 

“You’ve been working here for nearly 15 months and in that time you have been a model worker. Is that correct?” he said. 

I knew one of the guards standing behind me, his name was Jim Carter. We were good friends. Or as good of friends as you can be when you work here and one of you works security. 

“That sounds correct.” I replied. 

The guards always wore plain grey shirts with a black badge that just said said ‘SECURITY’. I always thought the badge was cheap looking. Like the graphic designer they had hired to make them had purposely made it look cheap to try and discredit whatever asshole was forced to wear it. 

“I’m taking the time to sit down with you today myself because of the seriousness of the situation.” 

The turn in conversation made me instantly uneasy. 
 
“We’ve got you clearly on video. Stealing from the shop.” he said.

I never stole anything in my life.” I said in my defense. 

“As far as I’m concerned, between this and your record here, I’m not really interested in hearing your defense. We’ve already searched for the missing item and although we have not found it, we are confident you are responsible for removing it. If you want to take up a formal complaint, feel free. We will be happy to present the evidence to them.” 

I had no idea what to think. What would I possible want to steal from this dump that would be worth it? A thousand stained drop ceiling tiles? I wouldn’t have a way to steal my own station’s equipment if I wanted to. I’m not dumb or incapable, but most of this stuff weighs a ton and is unwieldy, even if you have a forklift.   

“You say you have me on video, but I've never seen this evidence. I never stole anything, I’ve been a model worker, like you said!” I shouted. 

“Mr..” the boss attempted to interrupt me. 

“Look, I have never stole anything. Someone who has always been so dedicated to his work and dismiss them like they were looking up the whole time, you try and reach up and reach me!” I said in my defense. 

I stood up and looked him in the eye. He looked like he had the soul of a coward. He looked like he understood that without the guards here to protect him, perhaps long ago in a more primitive time, he knew I would have torn him open and devoured him piece-by-piece. 

 “Someone who was so dedicated to you, you try and reach up and reach someone, like they were looking up the whole time” I shouted. 

The guards grabbed my arms and pulled me back.

“Yes, well you are entitled to see the video so we’ve arranged that.” he said as he slid the manila folder across the desk.  

“Your documentation is in this folder. Mr. Carter has pulled all of your personal items from your locker and has them for you on your way out.” 

I got up from my chair and took my box from Mr. Carter without making eye contact and waited for the door to open. 

Who were they to accuse me of stealing? They have a video tape of me stealing? From what, their grainy black-and-white security cameras? I couldn't wait to get watch this garbage. I couldn’t wait to call my lawyers and get them to sue that suit right off his back, I thought to myself as I’m led down the same long windowless hallway i’ve walked down a thousand times before. 

The moment I get back, I stare at myself in the mirror. 

“Your skills are in-demand and you are better off without them.” I assured myself. 

Finding affirmation in your life is an important part of being a functioning member of society. I was taught as a kid that if you visualize something positive happening then it will happen. The longer I look at myself the more the room behind me fades away. The security footage playing in front of me is black-and-white and of poor quality, but you can clearly see Frank stealing a replacement belt from the backroom. You can clearly see him taking it back to his bedroom, and sewing it into his mattress. 

“I am a valuable member of society.” I said as I stared into my own eyes. 

“There is a reason that no matter how hard you try, you will always lose. Do you know what it is?” 

I pick up the manila folder from the table and shuffle through the contents. Right away I spot some glaring problems with the paperwork. I can’t wait to take this back and show all of them that I am innocent. I had always been innocent. Without thinking I reach behind my mattress and gently pull a blue thread tucked neatly along the edge seam. The thread unravels and reveals an opening. I reach in to retrieve a long black mechanical belt. It had been severed and rolled neatly into a ball. 

“Dismiss them, so dedicated to his work and dismiss them…” I trailed of. 

“It’s because you are a fucking loser. The world will be a better place without you.”

I looped the belt around my ankles and my neck, and tied it off very tightly.

Then something pushed me forwards as I rolled away from my bunk. The force of my own body tightening the belt’s grip on me. I try my best hold my breath for as long as I can as the rubber digs deeper into my neck. The world around me gets darker as i am forced to gasp for a breath; I choke as panic washes over me. I gasp and fight the dark for what seems like minutes, hours or maybe days. 

“Open cell 546!” yells out a distant voice.

A woman’s voice, another guard I'm friends with. The buzzing sound startles me as the cold metallic sound of my cell’s door sliding open lulls me back to sleep. 

“He’s done it again!” she screams down the long hallway.

Pushing a sheet of rough wood aside, he hunched over and stepped out into the graveyard city with a bundle of coarse rope in his left hand. The air was cool and the wind was dead; the sounds grew fainter and then disappeared with the clanking of a manhole cover. Rats indeed.

His steps were slow, and often fell between two uneven slabs of concrete, sending a sharp pain up his back and an echoing cry through the air. His hand met cold steel on his right. The object was curved as he ran his hand along it. *Perhaps a sports car*, he thought. He withdrew his hand from the car and brought it to his nose, a metallic scented resin laced his fingers. *Fresh paint. Fresh blood.* He reached his hand back out beside him, feeling out the objects on his right.

One hundred and ninety-nine steps later he stopped still in the road, counting didn't make the journey faster, yet still he counted. His right hand had met a cold column of metal, tall and smooth beside him. Feeling his way up the pole he felt a small peg jutting from the steel. He brought the twine of rope to the peg and wrapped three times around it. Thrice around the peg and once around his neck would do. His weak legs gave out at they would and the black grew darker. He felt a nibbling at his limp boot below him, a pitter-pattering emerged from the night and engulfed him. *Rats or rain.*

I looked outside. I had grown up staring at the same landscape for seventeen years. The first person in my town to have been born with sight. My parents were blind. My grandparents were blind. My friends were blind, and their parents were blind. It was just how things were. It's how they've always been. 

Dozens of years ago the world was engulfed in flame. The flame of the sun. Most of the population was killed, either from the initial blast or the fallout that came afterward. Everyone who survived, or at least everyone who had made themselves known, became blind. They adjusted, formed communities, began making life easier for themselves.

People are assigned specific tasks. Some are raised as water gatherers; they learn the trails and the water routes. They listen to the rushing water of a river and the calm serenity of a lake. They learn to contain and carry the water. They live near the water shed. And they dream inside the oceans.

Others are raised as gardeners. They touch the leaves of a plant, or the dirt of the Earth, and they learn when it is time to plant and when it is time to harvest. They use their hands to grow food for us all to eat. And they taste the plants when it is time to eat; knowing that their job was done when it is good, plentiful, and nutritional.

Then there are builders. As the population rises once more, there are people who must learn how to craft. They chop the wood with precision, feeling the cuts as it buries deep inside and they do not worry that they will miss. The trust themselves. When they plant the beams, they know exactly where it is in the dirt. They can build great shelters rivaling the houses from the old age. And they are great, and they are big.

There are other jobs. Dozens of others. Those in line with their sense of hearing and smell go hunting. They learn the woods and become one with nature, letting go of their sight and imagining the Earth as one giant forest. A deer crunches branch and a hunter lets loose their arrow; and the community eats. Those who have a strong sense of touch work the machines; great engines of an age long gone that our grandparents taught our parents how to use without their sight. They taught us. And we will teach our grandchildren. 

They cycle continues. Without the sense of sight, people learned to trust one another, to keep each other going. They began to trust in their other senses. Water gatherers do not falter in their step because they can hear the flow of the water. Gardeners do not fear a plant will overgrow or over hydrate because they can feel the earth; they can taste it. And hunters do not miss because their smell, and their hearing, helps them line up the perfect shot.

Then there is me. I imagine there are others like me. But not here, not in my town. I can see. And for that I am a storyteller. I see the world. The whole world and I forgo my other senses in order to tell the people stories. Some of old. There are many books in our town's library, in my home. I read them day and night. I become a historian, a future teller, and a person who can see the world for what it truly is.

They come to me in the night, although they would not know that. They ask me questions about the old age, before the bombs. Others ask me about the bombs. Some ask me about the weapons and how to defend ourselves. We do not need to defend ourselves. We just to need survive. I tell them. Some listen, others do not. But they always come to me, and they always ask the same question.

*Tell me again what it looks like.*

I tell them. That the world is bright and full of colors they cannot imagine. That water is a bright shine like the sky and clear as a crystal. But they do not know. That the plants are colorful and beautiful and the colors clash together in a beautiful display. But they do not know. That the animals we hunt are majestic and their walks through the forest are another way of life, just as ours is. But they do not know. That the buildings they create are great and large and stretch into the sky so that in the night you can see a tower stretching on the horizon. But they do not know. That the machines they work create pitch black smoke that stretch into the sky and dance with the clouds. But they do not know. 

I tell them all these things. But I do not tell them of what is truly out there. They learn what I say. They dream what I speak.

I do not tell them of the world that exists outside of their four senses. 

I do not tell them of the colors that no longer exist. That the carrots they dig up are not a glorious orange that blaze like the sun, but a curious green that look sick and tiny. That the water they gather is not clear as crystal as my books say, but as dirty as the clouds the machines make. I do not tell them that the majesty of the forest is lost. That the deers they hunt are not mutated and mangled and former husks of what I see in the library. I do not tell them that the animals scurry and hide when the clouds and storms crash into our homes. That the luscious green that existed an age ago has turned to ash and brown in the years of radiation. 

And I do not tell them the worst truth of all. That when the nights comes I become fearful because there are no lights on the horizon, no great towers that stretch far into the land. 

I lie.

I lie because I must. Because I can see the world for what it truly is like. I see the world as dark and black and mysterious. Not in the way they see it. Not with four senses of purity. But only in sight. I see the world in only one way, in the truth.

In only the wasteland that it is.

The whole situation was decidedly uncomfortable, but to the holy man's credit he was doing his best to make a terrible situation a decent one.

""We'll carry on. Ivan would have wanted that. Through all his trials, all his troubles, he cared deeply for those nearest to him. He would have wanted you, all those gathered here to honour his memory, to be able to move on in the joy of life after his passing.""

*We can try to understand*

Ivan's siblings and mother took to the front, speaking of Ivan's childhood, his friends; the typical anecdotes that happen during a funeral. It was a beautiful service in many ways, but the music that followed him throughout his time on earth proved to make it a mockery. Beneath the tears and grimaces, pangs of frustration shone through on the faces of Ivan's closest. 

*Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother*

His father, owning the only dry eyes in the room, spoke next. Their relationship was built on the belief that Ivan was bound for great things - the typical hopeful father. However, the pressure weighed on Ivan. Any failure proved a heavier burden, having to face not only his own personal demons but also the gaze of his father, always upon him, never ceasing. His speech was colder; not necessarily from the speaker but from those that knew Ivan so well that believed it may have been his father that pushed him ever closer to his ultimate death. No, it was not the time nor the place to lay blame, but each passes through grief in their own ways and there were more than a few that felt anger towards him, even if it was just a fire to dry the tears in their eyes. 

*Life goin' nowhere. Somebody help me*

There wasn't an attendee that didn't take some degree of blame. Each spoke their final words of love and respect, each knowing the words were empty of meaning now and coming all too late.

*Somebody help me, yeah*

In the final moments of the funeral the most heartwrenching part of the ever-playing song came through once more, all the louder for the somber quiet. 

*Ha!*

The song's piercing staccato, straight to the heart.

*Ha!*

The mother cried over her lost son.

*Ha!*

The brother consoled her, but he couldn't manage to hold back his own flood of tears.

*Ha!*

The father, filled with sorrow, felt the first pangs of loneliness even among his family.

[IP] Can you hear them singing?,shijinn,"*I’ve wanted to do an image prompt since starting here. Let me know how it goes.*

The Hibiscus. In its various types it is the national flower of two countries. It has uses in paper making, food and drink, Chinese medicine and bubble blowing. It is also symbolic of the goddess of destruction in Hindu worship. Fitting really.

The first few times I saw her she simply stood by the flowers. From behind one might say that she was captivated by them. She would come on an almost weekly basis. I worked in the gardening store. She would always stand by the Hibiscus. Stand there for however long, then satisfied she would leave. She never bought something. She rarely stopped by the other flowers. Only giving some a passing glance. 

I tried to spark up a conversation with her a few times. I wanted it to be a normal conversation. I had tried many times before. Only to get a name. She said she didn’t want to buy the flowers. Other short abrupt answers to my questions as I tried to catch her between the entrance and the flowers. Or between the flowers and the exit. One day I tried to talk to her as she was watching the flowers. Seemingly memorized. Yet in my blunder I simply mentioned some plant trivia. All attempts at an ordinary conversation failed the moment I did. No. Perhaps there was never going to be an ordinary conversation in the first place.

“The hibiscus flower grows in warm temperate places. Mostly tropical and sub-tropical areas.” I instantly failed at starting a normal conversation. Most ordinary people wouldn’t understand half of what I had said. 

“Like Islands?”

“Yes.” Well close enough. She isn’t wrong there. They just grow in a lot more places than islands. Nor do they grow on all islands. This was what my brain was thiking as my mouth engaged with something else. “There is over a hundred different kinds of Hibiscus.”

She didn’t appear to be paying much attention to me at all. Only having eyes for the flowers. “I like them. I can hear them singing.”

I instantly retaliated. “Sorry, Anya but flowers can not sin-“

“Shhhh.” I was stopped mid-sentence. “You have to listen…can you hear them?”

I didn’t say anything. Stunned into silence for a moment as her eyes looked into mine. It was at this moment I had just realised that I had called this customer by her first name. My brain went into a meltdown as I affirmed in my head that flowers cannot sing. 

“No. I can’t.” Maybe she’s one of these people that has their senses mixed up. Synaesthesia I think was the word. I decided to humour her none the less. “What’s it like?”

“They’re happy here.” I had to almost physically stop myself from correcting her by saying that flowers would have no such emotion such as happiness. She then turned to leave.

The Hibiscus. Another name for them is the rose mallow. This name may be more fitting of Anya. Mallow gives the impression of something soft squishy almost. Like marshmallow. But get to close to a rose and you get the thorns. 

She continued to come for the weeks following. Not that she said anything more to me in passing. She continued to go to her place in the store and listen the happy flowers sing. As ridiculous a premise as it sounded. I wonder what it was she heard. Was it a soft melody, like that of bird song? Or something more sombre. 

One day the flowers that she stood before gained a white, almost fur like quality to the underside of the leaves. However did an infestation of Mealybug break out. Unfortunately many of the plants had to be removed from the store including the Hibiscus Liliflorus that Anya liked to listen too.

Anya liked to visit on a Wednesday. I don’t know why but she tended to visit on these days. The following Wednesday she didn’t come into the store. It wasn’t until I had closed up for the day. It was raining and I didn’t have a coat or an umbrella. I was going to have to run for the car. I was hit by something metallic in the back of the head. I was falling before I processed the sound of metal against my skull. 

“Could you not hear them? Could you not hear their sadness? There screams. Could you not hear them?”

I rolled over. I saw them. Shovel raised. Standing over me. My vision may not be completely clear. One of my eyes closed from the blood pouring into it I was pretty sure the glasses on that side were broken anyway. But still I knew. I lay there in the mud. The flowers had been strewn around me from before I fell. As If the figure had been waiting for me. With nothing better to say. The reality of the situation not completely dawning on me. 

“Can you? Can you hear them singing?”

I was surprised by the effectiveness of the shovel. It occurred to me that shovels were used as a weapon in World War 1. Both as bludgeoning weapons and through using the sharp blade to cut if it gets pushed through the right place.",1morestranger
[IP] Can you hear them singing?,shijinn,"Bruce lay in the mud, the rain washing away his blood and tears. ""How could that date have gone so badly?"", he wondered. He had been excited about his date with Pamela all week. He thought she might enjoy a trip to the arborium. Pamela knew a lot about plants, but he thought he could impress her with what he had learned about several of the flowers that were grown there.Things started innocently enough, but the evening really took a turn for the weird when he started talking about the beautiful Hibiscus that grew at the end of one of the aisles. ""Can you hear them?"", Pamela asked, ""can you hear them sing?"" She looked at him with her big green eyes. Bruce didn't know how to respond, frankly he thought the question was a bit weird. ""Sing?"" He unintentionally gave off a puzzled look. ""Yes, all of the plants sing"" Pamela responded. She smiled. Bruce smiled back. He didn't understand what she meant, but he thought that Pamela might want to take one of the flowers home, so he quickly plucked one . Bruce whispered, ""I know I'm not supposed to do this; but I DO know the owner so..."" ""NOOO!"", Pamela interrupted, ""You're hurting them!"". Bruce woke up several hours later, the bright sunny day had been overtaken by a vicious thunderstorm.  He just lay there, sad and alone as he wondered what the heck actually had happened.  ""Bruce! Are you alright?"" Shouted an older gentleman, his tuxedo flapping in the wind. ""Yes Alfred, I'll be in in a bit."" Bruce Wayne kept his distance from Pamela Lillian Isley from that day on.

"[WP] Humans have decided to live in a computer system. Hundreds of years later, a group of people leave to Explore an Earth covered by plants and animals.",zpgreen,"The problem was straight forward:  We screwed up.  We pushed Earths environment past it's tipping point.  A new ice age, terrible and long, was inevitable.  Life would survive, of course, even human life, but not before billions died from frozen farms, and billions more from the inevitable wars for the remaining arable land.

So we had a plan.  The perhaps unimaginatively named Arks.  1000 Arks spread around the world, built to ""Ragnarok-proof"" standards.  Built over stable geothermal vents for fuel-less power, with backup low-power nuclear reactors built using radiactive fuels rated for 10,000 years of continuous power generation, and enough redundancy to power the ark 10 times over.  The arks were tied together using a superconductor web with each ark connected to 10 others directly, a giant mesh of redundancy.  Even if half the ark's power generation failed completely, the rest of the network could pick up the slack easily.

The computers, though!  That was the masterpiece that made the whole system possible.  Advances in quantum computing and solid-state components mean that, barring physical damage, the computers should be able to run for 20,000 years before anything starts failing, and like with the power, each Ark had enough computing power for 10 times their individual need, to take up the slack for unexpected failures.  Then there's the automation.  Nobody wanted to Just Hope that nothing went wrong, so automated machine shops and repair drones were created and built en masse.  Each drone was capable of completely rebuilding any part of the Ark, including another drone, and sufficient raw materials were stockpiled to rebuild the Ark 10 times over.

The flash-clone bays were just a variation on traditional medical cloning techniques, but getting everything to work together and allow for Arrival took almost the entire duration of the Ark project.

All said and done, the ""Core"" of each ark cost approximately the 1/4 the GDP of the entire world.  Quite frankly, everyone was amazed the alliances lasted long enough to actually finish the project!

And then, on U-Day, the day we all went to sleep.  Our brains were uploaded into the Arks (except for a small handful of around 60 million holdouts.  But if they want to wait through an ice age the hard way, more power to them), and our bodies rendered into raw materials for long-term storage until they can be used to rebuilt a new body for Arrival day.

The first century was uneventful.  Through monitoring stations and satellites, we watched the ice age worsen beyond all projections.  The glaciers hit Kansas 50 years early, and Texas 300 years early.

Centuries pass.  One by one, the monitoring stations were knocked offline by the harsh conditions, but not before confirming life has adapted.  Despite the relative lack of calories available, it's estimated that animal life was at it's highest biomass since the industrial revolution.

The satellites go offline one by one.  This was expected, but still disheartening.  At least the last few were able to confirm that the debris in orbit was slowing clearing out as they decayed into the atmosphere.  Our orbital space should be cleaner than any time we were using it since the moon landings.

And then we were blind.  No more platforms available for direct surface observation.   But we'd built much better models using observational data, we have a pretty good idea how long we must wait until we should bother checking topside.

With the last of the stations down, a lot of people decided to sleep through the long night.  They instructed the computer to turn down their clockspeed until contact with the surface was re-established or someone woke them.  And just like that, centuries would fly by in minutes.  More and more people went to sleep, and then the worst happened.

Ark 538 went offline.  Diagnostics from earlier that year showed nothing amiss.  3 of their powerplants were offline, but that was fewer than average.  70% of their population was sleeping, about average.  No unusual seismic activity, no *anything.*  Just ""All systems normal"" and then POOF, gone.  A quick query of the network shows they went offline at the same time through all 10 connections.

It was a mystery, one that couldn't be solved for thousands of years, until the ice retreated, so I was resolved to put it out of my mind.

Then Ark 247 went offline.  And Ark 418.  And Ark 834.    It made no sense!  There wasn't anything wrong, no warning, no *nothing* and then POOF.  GONE!

The few people awake in my Ark were getting agitated.  10% of humanity is now just *gone.*  100 Arks, offline.  Some were screaming with virtual hysterics, others put themselves to sleep.  One person even deleted themselves.   I pondered.

More time passed, more Arks vanished from the network.  Now that there are more Arks offline, I noticed something strange:  Their network connections were still active.  There was nothing there, but information could still be routed through them.  Even Arks that should be completely isolated by the failures were still in communication.  At least that rules out complete power failure or physical destruction... but what does that leave?

It is now within 100 years of when the projections called for a surface excursion.  And my Ark is the only Ark left.  I order the repair drones to build a surface probe.  When it's complete, I activate the program written so many years ago that even with perfect computer-aided recall, it's a little fuzzy in my mind.  Slowly it rolls up the exit ramp, blast doors opening in front of it and closing behind it.

After what seems like an eternity, it breaches the surface through 50 meters of earth, rock, and ice that has accumulated over the years.

And it picks up a cacophony of signals.  They don't match any encoding the computer recognizes, but it gives me hopes the other Arks *did* survive!

After letting the last few people awake in my Ark what I found, and instructing the computer on what to do if I did not come back, I flash-cloned myself and downloaded into my new body.

The technique worked perfectly, the machines perfectly maintained by the drones.

It was weird being in a physical body again, but I'd been training for this, running Body simulations off and on for the duration of my stay in the Ark.  I didn't expect it to be so cold, though!  Optimal temperatures for computers is not the same for people!  I flash cloned heavier clothing, and began my trek to the surface.

When I was getting close, I switched the surface probe from receive to beacon mode.  I might not know what they were saying, but if they're sending, they can hear.  A 100,000 watt beacon can be heard from a long, long way away.   Someone would come to investigate -- if for no other reason than to turn it off because it's interfering!

So I set up an emergency shelter (with a gloriously warm heat source) and wait.

And wait.

And wait.

It was 18 days before I witnessed a response from my beacon.  Some sort of ... ship?  Airplane?  Circled overhead.  It's design completely unlike anything I've ever seen.  I couldn't even begin to trace it's engineering lineage.

After circling for an hour or two, probably localizing the exact source of the beacon, it left, flying off almost faster than I could follow.  I knew it couldn't be much longer now.  And I wasn't disappointed.  Less than 5 hours later, another ship, seemingly bigger (though distance made it hard to judge the scale of the first ship), comes in low and slow, and just drops down just over the horizon.

A few minutes later, I hear a vehicle approaching and spot what looks like a cross between a snow mobile and a minivan zipping towards me.

I send another quick update down to the Ark and prepare as best I can for what comes next.

And all my preparations were for naught.  Whatever it was that exited the vehicle, it was not human.  Sure, it was the same basic body plan as a human, but it's proportions were all wrong.  The legs were too short, the arms too long.  The chest was a lot bigger than I expected, and it seemed to be put together at different angles.  It walked upright, but it's head was say far enough back my neck ached in sympathy.

But imagine my surprise when it spoke in perfect English!  Exactly the dialect of my Ark!  Though what they said was even more shocking than how they said it:

""We're with the Intergalactic Red Cross, and we're here to rescue you!  Are you from Ark 753?  We've been looking for you guys for 5000 years!  Did you know the records of where this Ark was built were off by over 500 miles?!""",Astramancer_

She has red hair. We run her hands through it, feeling the strands tickle her fingers. We run those fingers across her cheeks and press in tightly on her skin. It's soft. ""Soft."" One of us remembers the simple word and it echoes through all of our thoughts until we cannot tell which of us it came from.

Today we leave the Blue Room. We built the Blue Room while we were still inside the system. We used machines. We used robots. We used the things we could control in the physical world to make this space and filled it with food, with furniture, with appliances, with everything the new body would need. Then we built the body.

We have her cross the room, picking up our backpack and putting it on her back. We fumble getting the straps around her arms. We recognize the door as a door and the knob as a knob and we have her pull it. The metal handle is warm. It opens. We step through into the world.

We are under a bridge by a river. We built the Blue Room to fit here, power coming from a small hydroelectric generator in the water. Moss dangles off the side of the bridge, sheathing us in green. We have her push it away and we see we are a mile from where the city has fallen. Millions of images of the past exist in our data banks. We know what used to be there. We recognize it in the rubble.

We have her breathe. We have forgotten about smell, except in abstract, and humid air fills her nose with sensations we cannot identify.

In the distance there is a sound that may be growling. We have her pull a knife from the backpack. 

Then we step out from under the bridge and walk towards the ruins.

"[WP] Humans have decided to live in a computer system. Hundreds of years later, a group of people leave to Explore an Earth covered by plants and animals.",zpgreen,"""Today, my friends, marks the one-thousandth anniversary of the day our consciousness was surrendered in the name of our mother, The Earth!""

The crowd burst into a round of applause. This was the day everyone had been waiting for for so long. Finally, the encryption key would be released and a man and a woman would venture out into the world, untouched by men for thousands of years- to see how the Earth had recovered from centuries of industrial waste, deforestation and pollution.

These two brave souls, known as 'The Scouts' were leaving the world they called home today. They stood on the stage, nervous as to what they may find, but optimistic nevertheless.

Their leader met them on stage, gave them a handshake, and wished them well. The crowd cheered as the Scouts entered the exit portal.

The Scouts awoke, in a large pod, in a room full of thousands of unconscious people. Their bodies had been conditioned their whole lives so that their muscles wouldn't suffer atrophy, and they stood up and walked for the first time in reality.

They unplugged themselves from the terminal, and continued down the stairs until they were outside. The world was a beautiful place to them, and compared to what they had been taught about the world prior to the submergence, they could see the visible differences.

The birds chirped and sang, and trees grew all over. Their were an abundance of creatures of all types about, and the air smelled fresh. They were the new pioneers, seeing the world as it was before humanity left their putrid mark.

As the two took in their surroundings, a bright light flashed, and they collapsed.

Hours later they awoke, almost simultaneously and looked up at the giant infrastructure from whence they came. it was ablaze. The whole world seemed to be encased in flames. 

Everyone they knew was in that building, their world as they knew it destroyed.

The lightening wiped out everyone when it struck the super-structure which housed the people of the world.

And all of a sudden, the fate of the world was in their hands.

"[WP] ""From here it only unwinds""",BitOBear,"Alarm goes off. Shit, Vivinson mutters and slips a hand through warm bed sheets and out from the powder-blue duvet to reach the nightstand where the alarm should be but isn’t. Fuck, he thinks and opens his eyes, the lids are dried cornhusks with gold-nugget dream seeds in the corners. The nuggets scratch his skin while he rubs his palms into them. The alarm continues to bleat. He slides his legs from the satin sheets and stands and walks across taught-coils of eggshell white, tasteful shag carpet. His breaths have form in the room. Tough, jagged exhales like cigarette smoke hibernating in his lungs being expunged. He’s naked and his testicles burrow under the wag of his dick, the skin naturally tan with furrowed ridges . He steps on a belt buckle. With the injured foot in the cradle of his hands, he hop scotches around the room, twirling and cussing. Fuck myself, he thinks, and comes to the armoire where the sound comes from. He finds the alarm in the third drawer he opens after pushing aside cashmere camisoles and cotton socks and the vinyl of Charles Bradley and Imogen Heap, and, what the hell, Chad and Jeremy. The alarm is a new Tivoli. 70s, stained wood facade. Mostly dials. No decoration that’s unnecessary. He does not know how to turn off the alarm. At least not now. So he fumbles open the cover that holds the batteries and he takes them out. You’re an idiot, he said out loud to the room, or himself. 

With the alarm disengaged he has leave to return to sleep. Except, laying in bed, he can’t. He is sandwiched between two decorative pillows that have elephants on them, and his head is on the real, lumbar support pillow that, frankly, has been doing all the work while Vivinson’s wife (on “business” in Ft. Lauderdale) has been putting front and center the damn elephant pillows that are scratchy, don’t do have a single pragmatic use to them, and that Vivinson just wants to rip apart like he were a spurned rottweiler. 

In bed, the damnedest thing is, Vivinson cannot remember why he’d set the alarm to begin with. It took a fair amount of foresight to lock the alarm in that armoire, making it a real bitch to get to. That means past-Vivinson had a plan he intended current-Vivinson to carry out. Now current-Vivinson, idiot, could think only of two things: first, the aforementioned past-Vivinson’s intent, and, two, ruminate on the prematurity of the alarm so that he could not even enjoy a morning tug in the privacy of a half-vacated bed without worry that his wife would moan and shake the bed frame and say, Could you please do that somewhere else, with all the verbal clarity needed to know to leave off the question mark. So, that’s his pickle, and morning is collecting in dense dew drops above the bedroom window’s single mullion. The diamond-y dew splitting into dozens of miniature replicas the shaking, brown, leafless branches de-icing outside. 

He thinks to yesterday, trying to remember if anything unusual happened: Through the morning, devouring the comic sections of the Herald after tossing the Times following a quick page flip for pictures; then outfitting himself into running-wear and taking a 15:00 pace and sojourning at Harry’s diner a mile down; then buying two apple crullers and sip on three coffees and then a fourth but un-caffeinated, then go in the back room to watch Glenn Kotche’s youtube drum experimental about warring baboons; then, being too full, his legs dense, calling his wife and asking for a lift back, but having to put up with bad reception for the call cut out after his request and when he called back it went straight to VM; then through the rest of the afternoon, back in the house with his wife away and no note; on the patio with a thumbnail sized joint hazing up his vision, he pondering the skeletal shells of lilacs and dead hollyhocks and the blackberries the bears had not gotten to, all shriveled like raisins; and then finally evening, mixing together Gosling’s and Gosling’s with a long pewter spoon in a highball glass with ice, weighing having another and then a third against the arrival of his wife. And then when he sat indolent on his couch, convincing himself he was not drunk when he was, he listened for the identifiable puttering of her engine amidst the Fords and Chryslers that went by on the road. But it never came. When he went to his phone, which he had kept in the other room, he read this text: ""On business to Ft. Lauderdale.”

Ft. Lauderdale. Weird, he thought of Ft. Lauderdale as a suburb. He called the number and the phone rang and rang and went on forever lit were an office work day. He hates that—just missing a call and now the caller has put the phone out of ear shot or the ring setting as vibrate. It’s such bullshit when he thinks about it. Putting on silent someone in your life as opposed to just missing them. Bullshit. 

Because she was gone, or despite of it, he goes to the bar that’s in the nook of the kitchen and leaned down to open the stained cabinet door, behind which they keep all the good stuff. He took out a bourbon. Cap was age glued onto the screw top. He wrenched it off and poured a bit and took a sip. It was no Pappy’s (he has never had it anyways), but it would do. He finished the glass and poured another. He re-called the number. Ring, ring, ring. “Let me tell you this…” He started. He remembers back to it, and maybe he dreamed this part, because it’s a bit fuzzy. It is an exquisite torture being incapable of recalling with immaculate clarity what he said. And he has a warm, burrowed fear in chest that the message involved the words bitch and cunt. But he’s dreamed those words too in the past. The phone call could have been part of those dreams. Unlikely, but he ponders it with enough conviction that it becomes fact. 

Still, none of that answered why the alarm. 

He gets up and goes to the shower after looking at his phone and deleting an email from an airline company and a security protection service. He basks in the steam blanket rising from the double-Kohler-head shower. He has a whole day in front of him and the suspicion he had plans is nagging him. That stays with him, drying and robing and plucking nose hairs, shaving and re-shaving the space below his nose so that there’s no evidence of stubble, but then he and the blade are too worn to do chin or cheeks. So he goes robed and red-lipped into the kitchen. He makes coffee using the beans she keeps in a brown-bag in the freezer. Beans she insists be ground fresh and only a tablespoon at a time. He grinds the beans and follows the ritual she’d set. Once brewed he takes his coffee and stands in the living room in front of a window. He looks seaward. The day is gliding in like a gold-tinged bird that settles on the rafters glittering all its day-shit on him. One would think he’s lost it, smiling out at nothing. His phone vibrates in the other room, but he doesn’t hear it. He sips his coffee, looking out at the day, from here it only unwinds, backwards and forwards, it ends up the same. He’s waiting for that call back. And, not coming, he’s ready to return to bed. ",1313131313
[WP] Animals have suddenly began to grow extra body parts at an alarming rate.,Bobicus5,"Hi everybody, and welcome to “Now You’re Cookin’!” I’m celebrity chef Dave Davidson, and today we have a fresh, wonderful meal for you.

We’re going to start off with my delicious fried shrimp poppers. These things were caught fresh in the wild this morning, I believe somewhere in the Ozarks. You gotta move fast to catch the adults, because they run fast.

So you want to make sure you remove the stingers – they can be poisonous if not prepared right. Just roll them around in the flour, and drop them into the oil, and they’ll be ready in about five minutes.

Now, our main course today is going to be mesquite-smoked salmon rump roast. These things are great, because they grow like 45 legs, and they get that nice hunk of muscle up in the upper leg that tends to be perfectly marbled. We’re going to be using an offset smoker to draw the smoke across, and we’ll rub it down with a nice mixture of spices.

Our side dish is going to be a sautéed quail tail, and the cool thing about these is that when these animals get scared, they shoot the tail at you and then fly away. I mean, who’s going to mess with an animal that just chucked its tail at you? Not me. But the cool thing is that means there’s an endless supply of quail tail. Have you ever been to the quail tail factory in Texas? It’s a lot of fun. They let you scare some of the little guys, and it’s hilarious to watch the tails go flying.

So we’re just going to de-scale these tails and chop them up, and we’ll sauté them in light oil with some zucchini spears and red potatoes.

And there you go, a nice meal for a date, or a weekend dinner at home. I’d recommend serving with a glass of turtle milk.

Hey, that’s it for this week’s episode of “Now You’re Cookin’!” I’m Dave Davidson. Join us next week when we’ll have an entire episode learning about buffalo wings, from how they harvest the wings off the buffalo to how to make the perfect sauce. Bye!",LordFirebeard
[WP] The New York sanitation workers have always secretly had the job of ridding the streets of cryptid monsters. Time to take out the trash!,Budobudo,"It wasn't always easy being a sanitation worker, always having to clean up after others. Of course, they never told you that was the easy part. When I first signed up for the job I figured I would be by myself, driving around in the middle of the night picking up trash, at least it pays the bills right? My first day I was assigned an ""experienced"" partner. He didn't say much, which made roaming the streets at night awkward and creepy. Every time I attempted to engage in conversation he gave short, vague responses, which pretty much killed any conversation. His face seemed expressionless most of the time, as if he were a zombie which admittedly creeped me out. We drove around in the middle of the night in an old white van with no windows. Our attire was thick white jumpsuits with a small blue emblem designating us as a ""Sanitation Officer"". That would be the only thing that they gave me was this white jumper. I always thought it was a bit suspicious considering that we were never actually cleaning up trash, we were just patrolling the streets. I never actually had a look in the back of the van to see what utilities we had at our disposal, little did I know..
     
It all started at roughly 4 in the morning, as we rode through a small residential block. It was pretty quiet, the streets were dead. There were long alleyways which ran beside the large apartment blocks. We came to an intersection, and waited for the light to turn. There was no other traffic, which made it tempting to run the light, as it seemed like ages we waited. It turned green and we began to make our way down the street, before we saw a large figure come out of the shadows and run across the street into the alleyway. It was too large to be a person, it had to have been at least 7 feet tall and as wide as two people standing beside each other and moved with great speed. I turned to my partner and asked ""What the hell was that?"", however he gave no reply and instead decided to floor it, the tires screeched and it echoed throughout the empty city. He came up to the alleyway and slammed on the breaks, sending me forward in my seat, the seat belt violently jerking my body. He hastily left the van and proceeded to the rear, where he slung open both doors and entered. I fumbled with my seat belt and joined him, I tried to ask him what he was doing but he ignored me. He removed a pure black suitcase from the van and released the latches, opening it. There was a black disc, a bit bigger than my hand with a handle attached to it. There was a small red button on the top of the handle. Next to the disc was what appeared to be the hilt of a sword with a small switch affixed to the side of it. He grabbed both of the items and tossed them to me unexpectedly, causing me to fumble and almost drop them. The only thing he said was ""You'll need that"", and hopped out of the van, wielding what appeared to be a small black hand gun in his hand. He quickly ran down the alleyway as I stood there looking at the items he had given me. I held the disc by its handle and rotated it around in my hand, observing it. I gave the button a try and the disc expanded with a blue beam of light, like something out of the movies. I tried the button again and the light vanished. I then clutched the ""hilt"" in my other hand and flicked the switch, causing a beam of blue light to erect from the top.
     
I sat there for a moment, astonished by this technology which had been given to me by some weird stranger that I barely knew. It was then apparent that I was given some sort of energy sword and shield, as if I were a futuristic knight. I was then interrupted by the sound of gunfire, however this was not ordinary gunfire, as I looked into the alleyway I saw my partner firing at large shadowy object scaling the side of the apartments, blue bolts of energy being hurled in its direction, glowing in the night. One of the shots hit the creature, causing it to fall from about 40 feet in the air, crashing into the ground with a large ""thud"". It quickly scurried to its feet and smashed into a nearby trashcan, hurling it into the direction of my partner and hitting him, causing him to be thrown back a fair distance, skidding the ground. I clutched my weaponry in both hands, activating them and charged into the scene of the battle. I watched as the creature fixated on me and began to charge towards me. It was at this moment that I had realized that I made a poor decision, and not a second after I realized this, it collided into me. I was sent flying, smacking my head into the brick wall and falling to the ground like a sack of potatoes. The pain was excruciating, however the creature was unaffected, and proceeded to run out of the alleyway, crashing into our van and tipping it over onto its side. I got to my feet and began to follow it to the best of my ability, however by the time I had gotten to the street, it was gone. Fortunately my partner was already a step ahead of me, and moved towards an uncovered manhole in the street, presumably the creature had entered the sewer system.
     
I removed my phone and turned on the light, peering down into the sewer. There was at least a 20 foot ladder we would have to scale to enter the sewers. My partner had entered first, quickly scaling down the ladders, I followed. The pungent smell ensued us, however we pressed on into the darkness. There were channels about 15 feet wide with walkways on either side, the roof of the sewers was about 10 feet tall. There was a trail of green oozing liquid on the walkways, presumably blood from the creature. We followed the trail for 10 minutes before coming to a large intersection, there was a large circle in the middle of the intersection where all the channels meet. We looked around for the trail, however we could not find where it had gone, until we looked at the wall. We stood there for a moment and then began to listen, as the sound of heavy breathing began to emerge. We then realized where the creature was, however it was too late and it jumped from the ceiling, pouncing on my partner and crushing him. This was the first time that I had gotten a good look at it. It was roughly 7 feet tall and humanoid with glowing red eyes, green skin, and large muscles. It was the width of 2 humans and had large pointy ears and two long fangs sticking out of its mouth, and walked on all 4 limbs, instead of upright. 
     
It quickly began to tear my partner apart, his screams echoed throughout the sewers before he was picked up and literally torn in half. The creature then threw him aside and gazed at me, my heart was racing and my palms were sweaty. I dropped my phone and engaged my weapons, the light emitted from my weaponry illuminating the scene. The creature charged at me, and I raised my shield and thrust my energy sword into its chest, the creature letting out a deafening roar which echoed throughout the sewer system. It collided with me and my shield pinning me against the wall. I dropped the shield and grabbed the sword with both hands and began to thrust downwards, slicing the creature in half and causing its green blood to ooze out and bubble, quickly layering myself and the surrounding area. The creature then fell limp, crashing into the floor with a large thud. I slid down the wall, and let out a sigh of relief.

I was blinded by the red glow of my surrounding before I saw nothing again - my eyes weren't given the chance to adjust, because a rough blindfold covered my face. Hemp rope scratched at my wrists as I was bound. A clawed hand tore into my clothes, stripping me naked, and then shoved me forward. 

I stumbled along a quickly warming stone floor, and as I was pulled along I could hear sounds of torture. A loud smack echoed throughout the room, followed by a bloodcurdling scream. I shivered as the smack sounded out again. It was much closer. The claws dug into my shoulder to pull me around a corner, and then I heard a grating voice.

  ""This is Riley. Riley Benson.""

  ""Are you sure?"" A sharp, feminine voice hissed. ""I was expecting a male.""

  ""This is who I was given, so get on it, why don't you?"" The clawed creature growled again.

I heard some shuffling, and a loud crack, before the female voice spoke, now close to the wall.

  ""Only Lord Satan himself orders me around, scum.""

The creature slumped to the floor with a groan. The female grabbed my hair and shoved me to my knees, then pressed my face into her feet.

""Kiss them! Worship my feet as you would worship your puny God. The ground I walk on is worth more than your useless soul."" She lifted me up by my hair and slapped me in the face, then dropped me and ordered me to crawl. Once I reached a wooden device, she pulled me up and chained me to it, face down. I felt the familiar cool wood of a paddle as she stroked my bare bottom. A stinging pain lanced through my backside as she brought the paddle down, and I shuddered.

""You'll feel this forever, you worthless wretch.""

I grinned against the wood, and whispered a reply, ""Thank you my mistress. May I have another?""",RudyChristina7

I sighed as I look down at my handiwork. Forty years, it took me forty years to track this son of a toaster down. The memories from before all this began flash before my eyes, I never expected things to end like this. To think that goodie two shoe philanthropist was all an act all these years. 

""It's finally over.""

""Freeze! Put your hands up!"" The man shouted louder than before. The sound of windows breaking caused me to look at the men diving in after rappelling down from up above. 

""You could've just use doors you know."" I yelled from behind the desks in the CEO's office while rolling my eyes at them, taking them aback and causing to give each a quick glance. ""And DON'T do that, don't take your eyes off your target or you will get yourselves killed one of these days."" I became exasperated looking at their rookie mistakes.

""I'm warning you one more time! Put your hands up, or I will shoot!"" The man from the door points his rifle at me, the sounds of the dogs barking is ever closer, probably just outside the door.

I thought I'd feel more... happy? Fulfilled? Maybe even satisfied? But after having my revenge, all I felt was emptiness. Utter emptiness.

I sighed. ""I will just do it for you.""

""FUCK! STOP HER! STOP HER!"" The man screamed while throwing something my way, one of those micro-flashbang no doubt.

I placed the pistol to my temples and pulled the trigger. There was pop and the world became white. There was a moment of tranquility, no sound, no pain, just a world of soundless white. I let myself drift in this tranquility as I await my death.

""Ahem!""

""What the?!"" The sudden noise made me jump. ""Aren't I dead?""

""Who says you aren't?""

I turned my head around, around, and around. I look down, but I see nothing but white.

""Oh, bloody hell!"" The voice claps twice somewhere nearby and the whiteness fades away, revealing an antique office cubicle from last century.

""Sir! The printer isn't working again!"" A man with graying hair screamed as he futilely bang the machinery.

""Not now, Denton!"" The voice, coming from a... what looked like a cooked lobster crossed with those pet lizards that's all the rage these days? No, wait, he looks vaguely familiar... I think I saw him back when I was in secondary education neuro-networks. Was it humanities and the end of religions? I can't quite recall. Although I guess it doesn't help that I blew my brains out. Wait, if I'm dead, does it even matter that I'm missing bits of my head? I tried to touch my head, but despite being able to see, I can't feel my hands... or even see any trace of my body.

""Aha, sorry about that."" The lizard... man... thing? started by apologizing. Wait, are those cloven hooves?! ""As you can see, our Hell program has upgrade to a persistent version! With the help of that engineer that was send here that accidentally started the Second Robotics War, we now have 100% immersion with guaranteed off the chart agony!"" 

He looks like some sort of cybevangelist trying to sell something, with his arms flaired out to show off the office.

""So, Mrs. Jessica Watson, let's see here..."" He opened up the binder in his hand, going ""hmmm"", ""haaa"" and other such exclamations every now and then.

But... my target was Jessica Watson, is this some kind of joke? I tried to keep a straight face as I wondered if I've been uploaded into one of those experimental consciousness preservation nodes. 

""Wow, I must say, Mrs. Watson, I am REALLY impressed with your work. I haven't seen scams like these since those Nigerian Princes from 200 years ago!"" The red thing in the black suit was getting really animated while reading the binder.

I try to peak over to see what's in that binder.

""Making them pay you for running a Trust and Safety Council that you use for sex trafficking, smuggling, blackmail, and as a general bludgeon to attack anyone that dared to disagree with you! This is just amazing."" The man shook his head in admiration. 

""And that cult following! So many useful idiots you've gathered to do your bidding! I can't wait to receive them!"" He suddenly snapped his fingers and smack his lips. ""And the way you get them to swallow that delicious, delicious hypocrisy without batting an eye. Oooohhh, you make me want to keep you all to myself!"" He squirms back and forth where he stood.

""But alas, your deeds are too great, so I'll have to get your role up and running right away.""

""Eh... Role?""

""Hmm? Oh, right, the introduction tutorial was taken down for maintenance, wasn't it..."" He snapped his fingers again, both webbed hands this time. ""Basically, you will be put into a role that's will be repeated for all of eternity! Isn't that great?! ABSOLUTE Job security!""

The man's animated motion pause for a moment. ""Just don't expect a different result when the program reboots, that's a cause for insanity."" The man tilted his head sideways, then kept going until it got back to its original position from the other side. ""On second thought, keep hoping for a different result, it would be a GREAT addition to our program here!""

The man put the binder away and pulled out an antique tablet, humming annoying, yet catchy tune as he pecks away, one letter at a time.

""AAnnnnddd we are all set! You have the honour of dismantling the very system you've created!""

""Okay, the prank has gone on far en-""

The world flickered for a moment and then all of the sudden, I'm in standing under a ceiling light, with a talking head on a big screen in front of me.

""Welcome to the ICA, Agent 74. This is your handler, Brad ""Woo"" Induna.""

Another monitor flickered to life on the side, with a curt ""Hello."" as greetings.

""Here's your first target, Agent 74, make it as inconspicuous as possible, best if you can make the Law think it was merely an accident.""

The head in the screen swerves erratically before it's changed to a video of the target. 

""Remember, there are no bad tactics, just bad targets."" A person who looks like a professor lectures to a classroom. 

Those words... those lying bitches! The scene of my husband hanging from the top of the garage flash before my eyes, I shouldn't have doubted him. I admit, I had a moment of weakness, but the Warren that I knew couldn't even hurt a fly, let alone rape someone.

""Let's do this."" That emptiness from before, it's gone now, that red man said it this was for all of eternity, right? I smile, a genuine smile that I thought I had loss decades before. 

""Liddy! No! Liddy!"" A man pounds soundlessly onto the clear screen, watching agent 74 from behind.

""Enjoying the show, Mr. Smith?"" 

""You sick bastard! Leave my wife out of this!""

""Hey, hey, woah there buddy!"" A red man in a white suit puts his hands up. ""You are the one that took the easy way out, she's just out there trying to do right by you, one vengeance at a time."" The man flash a bright smile. ""Take it easy, enjoy the show, there's plenty of booze and snacks! That's kinda your forte, isn't it? Ahahaahahha!"" The red man laughed as he walked out of the luxurious office, leaving the man who keeps trying to stop the woman on the other side of the screen.


Elsewhere...

""Woooooah, these numbers are off the chart!"" One of the redmen group happily shared, while staring at the report. One of the other men peeked over to look at the report as well, then whistled a long sound.

""What role was this... Linsay Smith put in?""

The first man flip the pages to the right section. ""She was supposed to be shut-in with no families or friends..."" 

""How the hell did THAT role generate THAT number?""

""It... it isn't the role...""

""What do you mean?""

""She got up on the first day and went to look at the mirror. She just screamed, and screamed, and screamed...""

"[WP] The devil mixed up your paperwork and gave you someone else's personal hell, which to you, is heaven.",Celeries,"I remember getting on a plane. I remember being so full of hate and anger my body could explode with it. I remember planning to get up from my seat after half an hour or so, after the safety demonstrations and all that. I was going to take advantage of the relative calm when the flight attendants would be busy preparing meals to the first-class passengers. And then I would walk up to a man about ten rows in front of me, and strangle him.

This time I would really do it. 

Only, I never got around to it. Because before that - unfortunately or fortunately, depending on how you looked at it - my body did in fact explode. 

But not with hate. It exploded because the plane exploded. With, apparently.. explosives. 

As the man in the black suit later informed me, there had been a terrorist attack. Somehow someone had managed to check in a bag full of bomb material and well... boom. The man in the black suit seemed to be very stressed about it. It was totally unpredicted, and it kept them all very busy, he said. I felt sorry for him. But that was, of course, before he introduced himself.

Actually, he didn't introduce himself properly. He just gave me his card when he introduced me to what he referred to as my ""keeper"". The keeper turned out to be a kindly old lady who looked a lot like a former neighbor of ours who had died a few years ago. I liked her, while Stan, my husband, hated her. As in really hated. For almost no reason at all. Maybe it was because he hated everything I loved, and vice versa. Or maybe it was because she happened to catch him with his friend's wife, and told on him. To me. And the friend.

That's when things started going downhill for Stan and me. But I'm glad the old lady was being honest. I'd rather have the truth than a bunch of lies. For Stan it was the other way around. After that we got into this downward spiral where in the end we did everything to hurt each other. He told lies to hurt me and I tried to hurt him with the truth. 

The problem for me was that my life wasn't intersting enough to hurt him, so I told him my dreams. My dream lovers, my dream projects, everything I wanted that would have been so much better than what we had and who we were. 

And he screwed around and lied. First he said he wasn't doing it but then, if he got busted, he'd say it was better than it had actually been. But I could tell. I knew him that well. I knew what a destructive and desperate act it really was.

But that wasn't the worst of it. we got into this really childish vendetta where we really tried to destroy each others dreams, tried to keep each other from persuing whatever goals we had. We should have gotten divorced many years ago of course, but there was always that last thing to get back at each other for. And THEN we'd sort it out and go separate ways. So it just went on and on..

Until he met that crazy bitch Melanie. Before that he'd never actually done anything illegal. But with her.. Well, to cut a long story short, he ended up stealing my passport and somehow he managed to get a loan on the house in my name. On the entire house. And then he left. With Melanie. He booked them on a plane and left for europe, for Paris. But he was such an idiot about it that I managed to find the ticket reservation, the loan forms, everything on his computer. So I got some temporary Id papers and decided to go on a little trip to france. 

For some reason I found his old passport too and brought it along. I'm not sure what I'd use it for, but maybe if I couldn't bring myself to actually kill him, I could use if I reported him to the french police, so they'd know what he looked like. 

I managed to book a ticket on the same plane and went after him. 

---

And that's the plane that exploded.

It was some comfort to know that he and Melanie had exploded at the same time. I hoped they were in Hell. I asked the nice old lady who was escorting me to wherever I was supposed to go whether she thought they were in hell now. She looked a bit surprised. ""Why of course they are"", she said.

I supposed the old lady knew what she was doing, so that must have been correct. Which meant they were in hell together. Good for them. 

The nice old lady walked me to her car. She said she was going to drive me to my house. I had no idea where I was but I figured it must be some kind of afterlife. Maybe heaven. Heaven was probably full of nice old ladies. 

The car turned out to be a vintage Mercedes that looked almost exactly like the car I had owned when I met Stan. I had loved it and he had hated it, and it was the first thing Stan had made me get rid of. He said he was doing me a favor, but I have regretted it ever since. I complimented the nice old lady on her car, and then she said ""why, it's your car. You should get Sean to drive you around in it more often""

Sean?

I asked about that too. And she said, as if she confided in me. ""You know, he's the most clever of them. If there ever is anything you need to find out, you should ask him"". 
""The most clever of what?"" I asked. 
""Of your husbands, of course"" the old lady answered. 

Husbands. Everything I had ever heard about heaven did NOT include multiple husbands. Something didn't add up.

I was driven to a beautiful house where the old lady dropped me off. Then a man who looked a lot like Sean Connery came out of the house, said hello to me and said he'd drive the nice old lady to tht train station. I went into the house and a man came to greet me. He looked exactly like Keanu Reeves. ""I'm so glad to see you"", he said and kissed me on the cheek. ""If there's anything you want, I'll be in my room"". After that another man came out of the kitchen to greet me. He looked exactly like Brad Pitt. ""I'm so glad to see you"", he said and then he did something which I shall not go into detail about here. Then he said ""If there's anything you want, I'll be in my room."" 

I went into the living room and sat down on the couch, trying to make sense of what had just happened. After about ten minutes, the man who looked like Sean Connery came back. ""Hi honey"" he said. 
""Where am I?"" I replied. 
""Why, you're in Hell of course"", said the nice man. ""And we're so happy to see you. We thought you'd be a mean ugly man...By the name of Stan.."" 

Wait. Wait.. 

I remembered the card the man in the black suit had given me. I hadn't looked at it then, for some reason. So now I took the time to have a good look at it. 
It said ""H.I.M Lucifer, CEO, HELL's correctional facility"" And then there was a phone number which was of course 666.

These nice men had been expecting.. Stan. Could it be that.. that Hell was a highly customised place? That there was a personal hell waiting for everyone?.. 
AND THAT STANS VERSION OF HELL WAS A PLACE WHERE ALL MY DREAMS CAME TRUE? BECASUE THAT WAS THE THING HE HATED MOST IN THE WORLD, MY DREAMS? 
And that would mean.. conversely.. that my version of hell was a place where STAN'S dreams came true.

And then.. I had his passport when I died and he had mine. Had there been a mix-up?

I asked the Sean Connery man about it, and he said, ""Look, I'll make you a really good Martini, shaken not stirred, and we'll talk about it. And remember, it's in the interest of all of us to get this right. That is, wrong. We're all so glad you turned out to not be this Stan guy"". 
Then he made me the best Martini I've ever had. And we talked. He explained a lot to me. Then he said ""If there's anything you want, I'll be in my room"" I watched him walk up the stairs. 

On the second floor, there were three doors. Three bedrooms. Not four. I decided to sleep on the couch that night.

Early the next morning, there was a knock on the door and there was this delivery-type guy that said he had a paper for me to sign. He said it was a non-digital version of a EULA, and end user license agreement. I had signed hundreds of those on my computer when I was alive, and I knew there's always a lot of legal text in them that nobody reads. There could always be a catch in them, such as ""I now sell my soul to company x.."". Maybe this time there was. There was a lot of fine print and there was no way to read all of it in less than an hour. 

But, I figured, given the circumstances that could work both ways. So I just signed it. Then the delivery guy did one of those reveal-things that devils love to do, and I could suddenly see he there were horns in his forhead. They must have been hidden by his long curly hair before. And I noticed he had a tail.

""You know what you just signed?"", he said. ""You admitted you have no complaints about your current placement. And that means you're stuck here indefinitely"". And then he smiled enigmatically. 

""I kind of thought it would mean that. But thank you for telling me. And screw you too"", I said, and smiled enigmatically back at him.

And then something occurred to me. All that time when Stan and I had tried so hard to ruin each others lives and crush each others dreams.. all that time we had been saying, ironically, that we had been doing each other a favor.

As a Christian it must seem self-evident to you, but just to take your first quote, to me all that seems to say is that God invented hell as a kind of house for satan, not that He hangs out there and tortures people in it himself.  The fact that it's God speaking and he says ""depart from me"" makes it sound like he's not about to show up in the place where He told them to go.

But I'm aware that you have to read all the scriptures in their entirety to understand it. I have definitely noticed Christians online arguing about their interpretations of the Bible, and they always bring in several pieces of scripture. There is definitely room for interpretation. As I recall, [only a percentage of US Christians even believe in hell or the devil](http://www.gallup.com/poll/11770/eternal-destinations-americans-believe-heaven-hell.aspx).


Also, they have different versions. Just to take your first quote some of them think it is this: [you are good for nothing but the fires of hell](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2025:40-42&amp;version=MSG) or this: [Get away from Me, you despised people whom My Father has cursed. Claim your inheritance—the pits of flaming hell where the devil and his minions suffer.](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2025:40-42&amp;version=VOICE)



Anyway, thanks for trying to help me. I found [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_views_on_hell). There seems to be a difference where some sects see hell as somewhere people are actively tormented by this and that, others see the main punishment being that God isn't there. ",Salt-Pile

Ever since I can remember, I had this thing for solving cases.  That's what got me into this line of work, the fine line between paranoia and following ones instincts with a possible reward of solving the puzzle was what cocaine must have felt like. That unreachable satisfaction that emptied, yet fueled the need for more. 
I spent many years of that life believing that it had no end, that I was always at the right time and in the right moment, a budist might even have applauded my natural mindset. But the truth was I spent it focusing on running, anxious of what was to come and saddened by what was or might have been. 
It a funny thing, ones mind. That evil twin that talks back with the most effective counter thought, provoking a reaction triggering every fiber, for it knows where to start disrupt. One can live in multicolored lands surrounded by beauty, or one can sink to the lowest point of a two toned delusional drama. And there's always that one in control, that in the end materializes all thought. 
Of course I had no time to see the bus, don't you understand how busy I am in my own mind? If you could have seen my remains, you'd understand it makes no sense to ask someone if that's the case when aesthetically incorrect. 
This was it, everything I had always heard about the transition was a lie. There's no light, there's no flashing of ones life before their very eyes, there's no music even playing. Seemed about right, how was everyone getting all these answers? The had to be dead and announce it to the living, communicate. I could only see me. Or what was left anyway. And that's alk I remember, for a very long time. 
Woke up to find myself in my bed. Was I dreaming? There's no way, that was way too real. My wife is right by my side, as beautiful as always, I had not noticed that in a while. I felt more awake than I had felt in such a long time, that  calculated at least 6 times as more as what I had spent looking at my remains behind that bus. The look of shock and horror in that girls face, the teens pointing their phones and taking pictures, a broken hearted bus driver. It must have been a dream, I'm alive.

Jonathan kept his eyes shut for a moment, expecting his alarm to ring any second. Every day was the same; trudgery at the office, with the canned routines and complete absence of personal connection, the same coffee and bagel from the same anonymous coffee shop, the same uninspired routine at the gym, which was merely a reminder that he would never play a game of soccer again, or climb mountains, or feel fit like he did in his youth, and a restless night where his miserably dull days followed him, without the briefest respite from the crushing totality of boredom in his dreams, which were either slightly disturbing or a mocking repetition of his dead-end job as a claims adjuster. 

This morning, as always, he woke up two minutes before his alarm, his bodies way of telling him that his life was as it would be. At least he could stare at the ceiling, like he always did, and fantasize about quitting his job and exploring Antarctica, or racing trucks in the Sahara, or hunting Bin Laden, or maybe just Kim calling him back and admitting that she was wrong and they should try to make the marriage work again. Or anyone calling him really. 

Instead Jonathan found himself staring at bright blue sky. A cloud of a steam rose when he exhaled, and rippled at a wall of noise hit him. 

Scrambling upwards, Jonathan found himself in a snowy rolling hillscape, dots of dark men and machinery scurrying about, with sickening stains of crimson splattering the snow. An assault of noise battered his sense and oily, dark smoke began to coat his tastebuds. It took him a moment to realize he was still being yelled at. 

""We're under attack soldier! The goddamn Chinese are coming across the wire! Get to the perimeter before skin us alive! Move!"" A rifle was shoved in his hands and Jonathan was stumbling across the snow into a trench filled with dirty soldiers. 

""They're crossing the field! Light them up!"" Jonathan raised the heavy rifle to his shoulder and began pulling the trigger. The M1 fought him like a live animal, and ejecting it's clip with a resounding ping. 

""You got one!"" Jonathan realized his blood was pumping, and there was the beginnings of a smile on his face as he shoved a new clip into the rifle and stood up for a better angle, firing as fast as he could pull the trigger. ""Your an animal man!"" 

Jonathan felt a tap on his shoulder and turned to see tall blonde man in a much cleaner uniform with silver bars on his lapels frowning slightly. ""Can we have a minute?"" Jonathan looked to the soldiers in the trench with him, somehow caring more about the approval of people he'd met minutes ago more than he could remember caring about anyone in his oddly distant real life. The sounds of battle were muted and they nodded wanly. 

Jonathan and the man strolled a ways back from the trench a sort of cloud surrounding them and cutting off the noise as they went. The tall man, looking at the clipboard, sized Jonathan up and down. ""You are Jonathan Morris Peters correct?"" 

""Morse?"" 

The man pursed his lips. ""Spelled m-o-r-r-i-s?"" Jonathan shook his head, and the man sucked his teeth. ""This may be a problem. You weren't born October 18th 1931? You didn't serve in 8th Infantry in Chosin in 1951-52?"" Jonathan shook his head again. 

""Is there a problem?"" 

The tall blonde man took off his helmet and ran long fingers though immaculately combed hair. ""Well Jonathan what happened is you died last night from a combination of prescription sleep aids and alchohol. Very unlucky, normally you would have been fine but it turns out you have a heart condition that has never been diagnosed. Tragic. Really. And seeing as how your salvation score,"" he pointed to a line-and-bar chart on the clipboard, ""is a tad low, you've ended up in Hell. Now we're a customer-oriented organization and seeing as to how one-size-fits-all isn't a good way run a business, we do customize our product for individual applications and, "" he chuckled, ""we made a slight boner and your in someone else's personal Hell."" 

Jonathan wiped some sweat off his brow and stared quizically. 

The blonde man shrugged sheepishly. ""So we'll admit when we re wrong, I'm not Hitler after all, though he is down here shooting BDSM porn somewhere, and rather than put you in the special environment we had for you we'll instead offer you a job in our analytics department. It comes with a flat, on-site cafeteria, health benefits and a gym membership."" He playfully bumped Jonathan's shoulder, ""I've heard they have a pretty fun company culture, casual Fridays twice a month and a summer employee appreciation barbecue. What do you say?"" He stared Jonathan for a moment. ""Alright then, back to killing hordes of communists for all eternity. 

Jonathan ran back to the trench. ""Get on the .50 soldier, we've got more incoming!"" Jonathan pulled the bolt back and felt happy for the first time in a long time. ",detroitvelvetslim

I get up and sure enough I'm a ghost, ethereal and naked.

  A boy with red hair dressed in green stands before me and with a sly smile asks, ""So you ready?""  I respond, ""For what?""  He says, ""To go to your afterlife.  I usually only guide children, but I get a childish vibe from you so I'll go ahead and escort you.  My name's Peter, nice to meet you Simon.""  I shake his hand and don't bother correcting him on my name assuming he has arbitrarily assigned me a nickname or something.  our shadows form a hole behind me and he shoves me down it and I fall screaming in fear.  He grabs my hand on my way down and we land gently at the gates of a palace my heart's racing, wait a minute I still have a heart?

  Peter looks at me and notes, ""Wow, maybe you're no fun after all.""  I respond gasping for air, ""I like games, I like running around and roughhousing, but adrenaline rush is not my thing.""  He shrugs, ""sorry to tell you buddy, the worst is yet to come.""  I ask, ""What do you mean?""  He says, ""Didn't you noticed we went down?  Welcome to hell.  Inside that palace is a series of rooms and one of them is your personal hell.  So if you already hated the ride down here, let's just say your afterlife is gonna suck.  I wish I could advise you some way of after-dying.""

  As we walk through the palace doors I ask, ""Wait, hell?!  Listen I've done some bad things, but I've done way less bad things than most people, and I've done way more good things, my good should totally outweigh my bad.""  Peter snickers, ""Save it for the judge, and speak of the devil,"" he says as he reaches the front desk.  An androgynous figure with long white hair, four pairs of shimmering gold and white wings and an outfit with many sequins smirks, and retorts sarcastically, ""Very clever Peter, you're such a funny boy with your puns.

I respond, ""No I never expected any of that, I just didn't expect you to be dressed like a glam rocker.  I like it.""
  Peter jumps in, ""This is Simon Crowley, Simon, this is Lucifer, or is it Lucy at the moment?""  The devil responds, ""Actually, I prefer Venus or Star right now.  Mr. Crowley is on floor one billion three-hundred and seventy six, room four hundred and thirty six thousand five hundred and two.  Here's the key.""  I try to gather up the nerve to tell them I'm not Simon whoever, but I also have a question I may never have another chance to ask, so I go with that instead.  ""Wait!  Umm. . ."" ""Yes?"" asks the devil.  ""I was just wondering. . .how come you seem to be the secretary?  Aren't you the ruler of hell?  Don't you have someone to do this for you?""  The devil answers, ""No, I am not the ruler of hell.  I was being punished here long ago, same as you.  Only I was banished to the heart of Tartarus.  After being a good boy since creation, it was decided that I could deal with a lesser punishment.  Actually hell has three rulers, additionally there are a few other hells that are less populated.  This one is ruled over by Hades, Lilith and Hel herself.  They are technically of equal ranking, but between you and me Hades is terrified of the queens.  Anyway you best be off to your eternal suffering, allow me to be the first one to initiate your torture.""  The devil gives me a big hug, leaving me very confused.  She releases me and returns to her desk.

  I say awkwardly, ""Umm thanks, it's cute that you hug with your wings too. . . btw what are your preferred gender pronouns?""  The devil suddenly looks very serious and responds, ""Female or gender neutral pronouns. . . hmm something is not right here.""  Her train of thought and intense stare are disrupted by a tall hooded figure and a little girl with swords at her sides.  The devil asks, ""Wait this cute little girl is hell bound?!""  The little girl turns red and yells, ""No!  This man is the one being sent to hell, I'm the spirit guide dammit!""  The devil responds, ""Oh sorry. . .this guy looks more like a reaper.""  As Peter leads me into an elevator looking thing I hear the man respond, ""I get that a lot.""
  The doors close and immediately open to a series of doors.  One door floats over to us Peter opens it and shoves me in, ""Bye!  Nice knowing you!""  The door slams shut.  I look around and many people are naked, painting each other, hugging, holding each other close, men and women, women and women, men and men.  A naked man with a large belly walks over and gives me a big bear hug and says, ""Welcome!  I'm Rain.  This is Hugland!  Your personal hell.""  I ask, ""Wait what?!  You mean. . .I get to spend the rest of my afterlife getting hugged?!  Hell yeah!  I mean. . .Earth yeah?  Hmm so Simon Crowley's personal hell must have either been hugs specifically or excessive human contact.""

  Rain seems a bit confused, but continues, ""In this land women rule, all men who mistreat women will have their penis bit by a brown recluse.""  I mutter, ""So I see Simon was a Chauvinist pig. . .So Rain, are you telling me that this land is feminist and females are to be treated like the goddesses they are?""  Rain nods, ""That is correct.""  I jump for joy, ""Awesome!  I'm gonna like it here.""  Rain asks, ""You. . . are?""  As I am about to answer I consider my answer very carefully, I've just realized that if I enjoy my hell too much they may send me to one I actually hate.  But I don't really want to pretend to hate women.  Before I can solve this conundrum in my head, I hear someone call out, ""You!""  The devil stands at the open door and gestures for me to go to her.  ""Come with me,"" she says.  I follow her.

  She says, ""There has been a misunderstanding, we have confused you for someone else. That hell belonged to Simon Crowley, which by the way you could've mentioned wasn't your name.  I responded, ""Sorry, I thought maybe names worked differently in the afterlife or something.  I assumed you knew what you were doing better than I did.""  She asks as she leads me back down the hallway and out of the palace, “So you liked that hell huh?”  I responded, “Yeah, I love hugs, and feminism, and women not suffering abuse.  Is there anyway I can go back to that hell?  If I do some work around here or something?  I really liked it.”  She responds, “Trust me you don’t want to go back there.”  I ask, “Why wouldn’t I?”  She responds, “Because those aren’t even real people, they are nothing but illusions, very sophisticated illusions, but none-the-less here you’re going you’ll have real women to interact with.”  I ask, “Where I’m going?  You mean I’m going to heaven?!”  She responds, “No.  You’re going to a different hell, but it’s the most heavenly hell in the entire universe.  It is beautiful, gold.  Women train to be warriors and psychopomps, goddesses visit frequently and many even live there.  The perfect place for feminists, and those who love children and cute things.”  I respond, “Whoever determined that’s where I get to spend my afterlife I want to write them a book, an entire book detailing how grateful I am that they would send me to the most perfect place ever.”

  Outside the palace is a golden carriage, instead of horses it is led by large golden cats.  A beautiful woman with golden hair and much golden jewelry despite a less than modest outfit, stands in front of the carriage.  She smiles big, “Hi I’m Freya, goddess of Folkvangr the realm in which you’ll spend your after life.  Niji are you ready to go?”  I respond, “I think I was literally born ready, but let me just say bye-bye to the devil.”  The devil gives me a hug and a kiss on the cheek and says, “enjoy your afterlife.”  She walks back inside, and I now see she has a cute wolf tail.  I ask, “D-did the devil just give me a kiss?”  Freya answers, “Yeah, she’s a sweet kid.  Got her-self into some trouble, but she’s really got a good heart.”  I ask, “Wait do you mean you’re older than her?”  Freya chortles, “I’m waaaay older than her.  She’s not much older than human kind.  I’m old even for a goddess, I was a queen of a realm when Zeus was still being raised by a goat.  Well here we are, Folkvangr.”
  Women and men alike wandered around like that other hell.  I also see some women sword fighting in an arena.  Kittens wander around rubbing against my legs.  Clouds of cotton candy float around me, I eat some.  Mmmm it’s so good. . . Yup, I’m definitely going to like it here.",niji-ouji

They likely chose snakes and football because they're very different from one another, and due to football being an unconventional punishment in the eyes of society which makes the story more interesting.",daemonpie

"[WP] The devil mixed up your paperwork and gave you someone else's personal hell, which to you, is heaven.",Celeries,"I felt my flesh cauterise and char as Satan jabbed me with a red hot poker into my left buttock, I could smell the burnt flesh as he shoved me forwards into into a small sandstone room. 

I stumbled and fell onto the floor grazing my knees on the coarse grit, I looked up to see Satan once again brandishing the red hot poker. 
In a loud booming voice he proclaimed ""George Frobisher you are hereby sentenced to an eternity of solitude!"". None of this made sense, I'm not George Frobisher, what the fuck? But before I found the words to express my confusion Satan advanced upon me and his thunderous voice once again boomed ""from this moment fourth you are to be stripped of the power of speech, sight and hearing!"".

As I opened by mouth to speak he rammed the red hot poker he was holding onto my mouth. The pain was unimaginable. I felt my saliva boil as my tongue was burnt to destruction. No sooner had he done that when I watched in horror as the poker advanced towards my left eye. The eye ball popped at be searing poker tip touched it. I tried to move but I felt bound and unable to even jerk my body as if held by supernatural bondage. 
He made short work of the other eye before standing beside me as he began to rob me of hearing. I felt my ear canal melt as he forced the oversized poker into the small opening of my ears. The pain was like nothing I had ever felt, the poker was wedged in deep and as he pulled it free with a might heft a huge chunk of flesh came with I could hear it sizzling on the end from my other ear. I wish that were the end of it but the remaining ear was waiting for him. This time he didn't mess around - my hearing was forever lost. 


Suddenly for the first time in my life I could hear nothing. See nothing and speak to nobody. No distractions only the thoughts in my own, even the pain seem contained by this as if it was something to be felt internally not an external force overwhelming me. 
You see for the first half of my life I was a hardened criminal. I stole, I robbed, I inflicted violence on others. In short I was a despicable human being which is the reason why I've found myself here in hell today on my knees in front of Satan I guess. 
However, in the latter half of my life I sought to put the criminal lifestyle behind me - I gave up the material aspects of my life and embarked on a journey of spiritual enlightenment exploring Buddhism. I achieved much understanding of myself during this time but I never felt I was ever close to enlightenment as the world around me was still bombarding my senses. 

As I sat in my sandstone chamber, totally sensory deprived I began to meditate. Wave after wave of raw emotion washed over me as I felt my consciousness transcend to something indescribable. Knowing that I now have an eternity of peace and solitude to explore this new state of mind must mean only one thing: This is heaven. Om mani padme hum. ",Lalalo84

Anyway, i found myself in a massive waiting room like at the doctors office. Some stoned looking demon with stubby horns was stamping papers at the check-in desk.
 ""Where am I exactly?"" I stammered when It was my turn to hand in my papers. As the demon took my documents and began sorting them he maintained eye contact with me wordless. It seemed as if he was trying to act tough but having a bad sense of humour about my own mortality I started chuckling. Flustered the demon quickly hands back my papers, as soon as I grab them I feel myself falling. 
They must have made a mistake. An endless ocean of massive swells, and a strong breeze. ""Stranded"" on a small little sailboat with a triangular sail. I couldn't believe it THIS was the hell I got haha! To someone afraid of the sea this would have been a bad way to spend eternity, but for me a life long sailor it was pure bliss. A steady breeze, surfing wave after wave getting the small boat up on a plain.

I jerked the charging handle on the M16 that had been conjured into my hands, anachronisms aside. There were Germans on the beach ahead of me, but we were in some sort of semi-jungle and I was wearing a 'Nam era helmet and some sort of semi-futuristic chest rig with polymer and all kinds of weird shit. I set it to burst and charged up the sand. I took a bullet or two, but I could feel them slowly squeezing their way out of my body, the wound slowly and painfully closing behind them as I sprinted up the beach, firing wildly, laughing like a maniac. ""FUCKIN-!"" I screamed, before being cut off by a burst of MG fire. I dove into a foxhole that was previously occupied by some Germans and quickly noted that the ones still here were more.... robotic? Than expected.... So I was fighting Neo-Nazi Cyborgs in Vietnam? ""FUCK.... YEAH!"" I screamed, finally finishing my sentence.




In some other room in hell, an older man, much older now, mostly bald, but oddly like a stereotypical ""friendly old man"", always wearing a sweater, never swearing, sat in a nice wooden chair in a cabin. The cabin was small, wooden, but very well made. It was on a tiny island in a temperate area, of the climate equivalent of coastal Maine. The fridge was always full of good food, the TV had a few very nice channels, but nothing too intense, and there was a chess board that would seem to always clean itself up after a good game. There was very little to do here, and he was fine with that. He could finally retire in peace. ",DarkComedian

She said she had to hire exterminators for all the roaches. She slathered baby sunscreen on me while humming an annoyingly awful tune. Even with the SPF 100 coating my back hair, I still burned. I was lobster red and I couldn't move for three weeks. The worst of that burn was not as hot as I am right now. 
And people. So many people! Mostly stupidly buff men with their sweaty pectoral muscles and tight pants. And that rhythm! The beat was atrocious and it made my ears hurt. I could feel it in my body, pounding. I started Screeing, but no one cared. The strobe lights, sound, and people sent me into a sensory overload. I slumped to the sticky floor, covered my ears, and closed my eyes. 
Then it all stopped. No more thumping sound. No more sweaty men. I opened my eyes and I saw two pairs of feet. Well, sort of feet. The ones in front were actually cloven hooves. I looked up and saw Satan. And the man behind him was grinning from ear to ear. He was short, super tanned, and wearing tiny shorts. 
Satan spoke ""This person tells me there has been a mixup. He says he is Alex Anderson. So that must make you Alex Rodríguez. Is this correct?"" I looked past Satan to the flaming man. He is clapping his hands together and nodding enthusiastically. Surely, I thought, no hell could be worse than the one I was just in. 
""Yes. This is true."" And with my confirmation, I was whisked away again. This time to a quiet library with boundless rows of books. And in the corner, a computer.... ",ravyn4179
"[WP] The devil mixed up your paperwork and gave you someone else's personal hell, which to you, is heaven.",Celeries,"I wait in the red colored room. Red floor, red couch, red walls, red, red, and more….red. 

""Why am I here?"" I think to myself, seconds after being hit by a car while walking to Target. My hands start to shake followed by the rest of my body partaking in the act as well. All of the sudden I hear a knock from the red door. A red colored demon with a black suit emerges.
 
“Your darkness is ready for you.” She says as I sit on the red couch. 

""Your darkness? Wait! Am I in hell!"" I exclaim within my thoughts. I slowly rise from the couch and exit the room through the door the demon is pointing at. I enter a hallway with portraits of Hitler, Osama Bin Laden, Gordon Ramsey, and of course… Satan posted on the wall. I gag at the sight of this heinous display, and continue down the hallway at godspeed, in which irony hits me. Alas it isn’t irony, instead it is another door. I shudder as I slowly push open the door to see a big red figure in a suit looming over a desk as his mouth meets a cigar. He flicks the cigar, ashes it, and points at me with his dark hooves. 

“State your name!” He exclaims in a deep haunting voice.

“H-H-Henry G-G-Greenfeld.” I respond, almost prying my mouth open. He flips open a large index of names and skims through the pages.

“H-H-Henry G-G-Greenfeld does not come up in my files.” He says mockingly. “Show that you have some balls so we can on with this”. 

It takes me multiple seconds for me to finally blurt out, “Henry Greenfeld”. He tears open the index once more.

“Ah, Henry Greenfeld, much better. You are assigned t room no.2382719276, in which you will spend the rest of eternity residing in. Have fun.” He says as I am ushered out of the room the room by two demon guards. They lead me through a  hallway to a room with the number  2382719276 etched with fire onto black brimstone. The guards retreat and I am left face with the door in my wake. 

I struggle as I push open the door hesitantly, and before lies… clowns. Clowns in white face paint smeared with blood in a way that is meant to look horrendous but instead come out as silly. I giggle a bit, then laugh, and then eventually work my way up to a hysterical fit as the clowns “menacingly” gaze at me. Eventually, the clowns realize that their efforts had seized to work and join with my laughter. By now I am on the floor still laughing, as are the other clowns. The room is eventually covered in square miles of laughter as an estimate of 1,000,000,000 clowns are now on the floor having a hysterical fit.

However, this laughter ends as a giant thump is heard throughout the room. I look back at the doorway, and Satan stands there overlooking the complete mess of the room. He walks over and takes my arm as he drags me out of the room and through multiple hallways.

We are then met by a door, but this door looks very different from the other doors in the facility. Instead of being covered by brimstone, this door is made out of metal. He pushes the door open and I stare at a wall of emptiness. 

“Thank you for your stay.” He says as he launches me out the door and sends me hurdling through the void. The hurdling however, doesn’t stop, and I continue through the void. 

""Oh great"" I think ""I’m in a place far worse than hell...nothing"". This thought does not last very long as I am then confronted by a white room with medical equipment in it. A searing pain covers my entire left leg and my head is filled with pressure as if I’m a balloon. Then, a refreshing kiss on my forehead comforts me, it’s Sady.

“How are you feeling honey?” She asks with a smile.

I laugh. “Like hell.”

""Nope, piss off"". Now apparently this wasn't the correct answer, but when the flames died down I found myself in a gilt mansion, the same smarmy bastard standing next to me. He consulted his papers ""now Mr Gandhi, welcome to hell"".

I opened my mouth to protest but it seemed as though he'd had enough to hear from me. The bandages appeared out of nowhere and covered my mouth tight.

"[WP] The devil mixed up your paperwork and gave you someone else's personal hell, which to you, is heaven.",Celeries,"I woke up on a soft couch in what appeared to be a busy upscale hotel. People were walking by admiring the vaulted ceilings with a smile or looking at their own extremities and looking around as if they were missing something. Most people looked confused, a few relieved, a few more angry. I wondered about where the people were who were calling out for their loved ones. Those people who died in pairs or as families, in car wrecks or house fires, or boating accidents. I thought 'they must go to another place.' This place was obviously for the singles and the loners. 

That was me. Forever alone. It wasn't what I wanted, but I wasn't exactly nice enough to deserve anyone. I didn't have the temperament for relationships of any kind. That's probably what killed me in the end; Sitting alone at work for years, then sitting at home after I got to fat to go to work, and finally laying at home until the money ran out and the delivery drivers no longer felt comfortable bringing food into my pigsty of a home.

I knew I'd die there. I thought it would be a heart attack as big as I got, but instead it was some kind of infection. At first just a little soreness in by back, then an itch, then what felt like wriggling, I couldn't reach it to scratch or roll over to see. I was just too big. Eventually I could smell the infection and by then it was too late to get help. My internet had been cut because I couldn't pay the bill and no one in the shit hole I lived it could hear over their own domestic situation to come to my aid. Slowly I got weaker and sepsis set in and I knew may fate and I was okay with it. 

As I lay there on the couch feeling basking in the unexpected comfort a man leaned over the top of me. I say man, I mean manish, sort of. You could tell that he was meant to look like a man, but his proportions were off somehow. He was beautiful like a greek statue, but his face was too long, his skin pore-less and smooth, it had a pearl like quality, and his hair-line was too perfectly even, every little hair folicle right in a perfect line next to the other.

""Hello Dan!"" The man said with a genuinely happy tone. ""I'm Beel. If you'd like to follow us, I can take you to your room.""

I looked at him and then looked around and saw the giant of a man standing next to him. He had to be almost as large as I was before I died, but entirely muscle. He had so many muscles and his skin was so tan and taught that it forced his face into a permanent look of surprised happiness - wide eyes, huge smile, perfect white teeth. It was disgusting, the only thing that disgusted me more than my own fat self. 

Beel put out a hand to help me up from the couch. At first I just looked at it, wondering how he was going to help up a 700 plus pound tub of lard like me. That's when I realized that I was laying on a couch. Not hanging off of a couch. Not draping over a couch. Just laying comfortably on a normal size couch, without any pain or discomfort. Able to breath without effort. Able to move my arms around without feeling like I was swimming through molasses. It was then I realized that I was thin. 

""So..."" Beel look at me and then looked at his hand. I must have looked shocked at the idea. He just smiled as if I'd made him the happiest man ever with that look. 

I took his hand and stood on two feet for the first time in years. It felt a little odd. I felt shorter somehow. My living height, when I could walk, was 6'4"". I'd always hated the stupid jokes people would make about it and the staring. It wasn't like I was monstrously tall like a basketball player, but it was certainly enough to draw unwanted attention. As I looked around for comparison at Beel and the muscle-bound guy I was guessing I was now standing at about 5'11"". Five whole inches shorter. It was my perfect height. Not too tall, not too short. Perfect. I must have somehow made it to heaven, even though I was pretty sure Beel was short for Beelzebub.

""This way please."" Beel motioned, directing us to a flight of stairs. 

I looked at the muscle-bound man and it looked like his face had tightened even more after seeing the steps. I wasn't sure that his feet would fit or how he was going to make his way up. But we continued on. 

Beel nodded to the huge man. ""Dan I'd like you to meet Dan."" He laughed at that. ""You know it's not very often that we get two people born on the same day who have the exact same death day. It's even rarer still to get two people who are also saddled with the same name. Danny Kay I'd like you to meet Danny Kay."" He guffawed at that notion, although I didn't understand why it was funny.

I'd hated that name. My drug addict of a mother loved older movies and decided to name me after some actor. Not Daniel Roger Kay or Dan Michael Kay or any other possible name, just Danny no-middle-name Kay. I changed it on my 22nd birthday shortly after my mother died. I was now Daniel Scott Key. It was close enough to be familiar, but different enough to make me feel better. Sadly some other poor bastard appeared to have an equally stupid or addled parent. I wondered if he'd also has his named changed. 

Then the ""crunch"" broke me out of my train of thought, as the other Danny crushed a stair step and almost broke the railing off. I was mortified. When I was alive that was my absolute worst fear; That I would try to go up stairs and fall right through or grab the banister and pull it down. I could see he must have had the same fear, as tears streamed down his leather-like cheeks as he worked hard to navigate the stairs, crushing one periodically, and making the rail creak and groan as he tried to recover. 

Beel seemed to grow more delighted with each damaged step. He was practically glowing by the time we reached the second floor. It seemed like both an impossibly short amount of time and ages all at once as I had to listen to that nightmarish sound and watch Danny cry all the way up. 

Finally we stood at a door with no room number. It looked nice enough, like any other door in any other hallway of any other fine hotel in the world. I knew it was too easy. I knew that I was already being tortured watching Danny come up those stairs and I knew that some new even worse torture was waiting for me on the other side of that door. 

Danny and I stood there on either side of Beel as he made his introduction. He grabbed the door and swung it open like he was Monte Hall presenting a new car. Right away though I was horrified as the door almost bounced back closed. What I saw for that instant the door was open was an all too familiar sight of a hoarders house. My house, but even worse. The smell was like cat piss, oh God how I hated cats, and the walls looked like they had mold. My apartment had some mold but only in the corner. This was all over making the whole room smell of cat piss and mold and look like a dark prison cell someone decided to make into a city trash dump. 

Danny continued his sobbing, now with a blubbering sound. He stepped back a step and I stepped forward accepting that this would be my eternal hell. Surprisingly Beel put out a stiff arm barring me from entry. He looked at me sternly and with his other hand waggled his finger, ""No Sir! This is not for you Mister Kay!"" 

He stepped in front of me, pushing the door open further while smiling at the other Mister Kay. ""Danny, if you please."" He said with a smile. Danny took another step back. ""Danny, now don't make this hard."" Danny looked like he couldn't see through the tears and the tears had now come out of his nose along with snot and dripped down the front of his face onto his tank top. I was pretty sure he couldn't wipe his face even if he wanted to with those arms.

"[WP] The devil mixed up your paperwork and gave you someone else's personal hell, which to you, is heaven.",Celeries,"I awoke to silence. My eyes, still foggy from what felt like years of slumber, slowly adjusted to the dim light of the area around me. I was in a small rectangular room. At first glance, it looked like one of those solitary confinement rooms. The four walls were blank, and the floor was blank. There was no sign of a door anywhere. There was light coming from the ceiling; there appeared to be ceiling tiles, and some of them were lit. The lights were in a square pattern, but only three of them were illuminated; there was a darkened tile where one of the corners should've been. The walls and floor were both concrete. The air felt a little heavy, as if the room was underground, but it also felt somewhat warm.

In breathed in and out. ""Ahhh..."" My breath ended the silence and echoed briefly. I looked around more carefully, to make sure there was no one else here. Nope; nothing but smoothly laid-out concrete. Actually, there was a sign with some writing on the wall to the left of me. I walked over. My footsteps knocked loudly off of the walls. I paused for a moment and realized I was still in ordinary clothes; I was wearing a black t-shirt with a video game print on it, jeans, and the shoes I normally wear to work. This was all pretty regular attire for me. Strangely, I didn't remember putting any of them on though.

I turned and faced the sign on the wall. ""GreenPencil's Personal Hell,"" it read. Suddenly I froze. What were the implications of this message? Was this real? Or was this some kind of dumb joke? I didn't know anyone who might've played a joke on me like this... I didn't have many friends. And even if I did, what kind of person would do something so weird to their friend? I tried desperately to remember how I'd gotten here. Nothing came to mind. ""Dammit,"" I whispered.

There was no door here, and this room was tightly sealed. Was this message true then? Was this... hell? Did I die?!

I didn't spend time thinking about my apparent death though; I returned to the fact that this was hell, somehow. I looked around for some source of danger. Was there some kind of trap about to go off? It felt warm in here; was the room temperature going up? Was toxic gas filling the room? But nothing seemed off. The room was silent and completely still. But then another thought popped into my head. There... is oxygen coming in here, right?! But if this really was hell, did I need oxygen? Was I still bound by human limitations in the afterlife? There didn't appear to be any way for food or water to come in or out of here, so I had to assume not. But if I was, I guess it wouldn't take long to find out...

""Well I guess it's true then,"" I spoke quietly to myself. ""But if so, then what the hell? It's just an empty room."" It's very calm here. Sure, it's not a very lavish arrangement, but some peace and solitude is actually quite nice. I took another glance at the sign. ""GreenPencil's Personal Hell,"" huh? That's really weird... and then I laughed to myself. ""Wait, there's no underscore in that name! Wow, that must be it! My real name has an underscore."" I laughed again. ""Wow, someone fucked up I guess."" I imagined some demon somewhere was getting chewed out by Satan for messing up something so simple.

I mean, this had to be a mistake. ""It's quiet here! I don't hate being alone at all."" I decided to speak louder. I assumed no one was around to hear me, after all.

""This is actually perfectly ideal for me. My personal hell would probably be the exact opposite of this! It'd probably be a room full of people... people that I hate."" I continued to entertain this disgusting idea. ""They'd probably be trying to talk to me!"" I chuckled. ""And I'd probably be under... some kind of curse that made it so everything I say is stupid or embarrassing or something. Maybe these people would be asking me questions that I don't want to answer. And they won't leave me alone, either!"" The deeper I dug into this fantasy, the more I laughed at myself. It was true: I really hated talking to people. I was stressed out over having to carry out any conversation. My job in real life as a cashier required me to be sociable. I had always hoped I would be placed in a career where I didn't have to talk or interact with anyone. The fact that there was no pressure here for that was actually a huge relief! ""This is literally my personal heaven! Nice one Satan, you moron.""

I sat down on the floor facing the sign and joyfully went back to the idea of a demon being punished for putting me here on accident. How do demons even get punished? Does Satan conjure up a personal hell for them? What would a demon's personal hell be like? And as I laid back on the concrete floor, staring up at the ceiling, I thought about the actual GreenPencil. He must've been mistakenly placed in my personal hell. How was he reacting? He must be really enjoying it, if his personal hell is the empty room I'm in. ""I bet he's having some great conversations with all of the people I hate! Man, he must be overjoyed. We really lucked out!"" As I thought more and more about how funny this situation was, I kept giggling to myself.

Beel stood there patiently until Danny started moving toward the door. I thought about how hard it was going to be to get this goliath through that normal sized opening. My fear was soon realized when Danny fell his way through the doorway, taking out a sizable portion of the door frame and wall. He lay prostrate in the middle of the room flailing back and forth like an upside down version of a snow angel, but instead he was a trash angel as he flailed those huge arms and legs through the refuse on the floor. 

""Ah, that's what I like to see, a man resigned to his fate,"" Beel said with a smile. He closed the door as best as he could and turned to a similar door across the hall. ""Now Mister Kay, shall we get you cozied in?"" 

He swung the door open, and I expected it to likewise swing back at him. Instead it opened fully, revealing a room that was devoid of trash or broken things and had ample sunlight streaming in from outside. It was so clean that I was momentarily taken aback. I just hadn't seen so much comfort in all the years of my life and here I was suddenly looking at a room I must have dreamed about a million times. I'd sat in my own feces watching home make over shows wishing I could get a room just like this.

""Please,"" Beel motioned and I sheepishly entered the room. It was a huge open plan suite, with a king sized bed at one end, an overstuffed couch and chair in the middle and an amazing looking kitchen on the other end. Right in the middle, just on the other side of the couch the whole wall opened up out onto the beach. The ocean was just a hundred feet away and I could hear the waves lapping at the shore. 

I was stunned. I turned with my mouth agape and started to say something to Beel, to get an understanding of what was happening here. He just looked at me with that devilish smile and said ""Oh no Mister Kay, there are no negotations allowed at this point. This is the hell that your life has lead you to. Please try to understand."" And with that he winked at me and quickly closed the door forever. 

I pondered my situation for a long time while eating steaks on the beach, watching sunsets and playing volleyball with scantily clad beach bunnies. The only thing I could imagine is that me and the other Danny were opposites in some way. He had accidentally gotten my hell and I had gotten his and maybe all those tears that I had seen were tears of joy. Here I was living in a house that I could never dirty, with all the food I wanted, good company and sand between my toes. I dreamed up what the other Danny's life must have been like. Maybe he had an over bearing mother who kept the house germaphobe clean. Maybe when he was young he hadn't been allowed outside and so he'd become an agoraphobic and his greatest fear was a beach like and open water where he might drown. Maybe his parents had always provided good food but never junk food and he longed to just pig out. Maybe he'd been short like I was now and feared getting stuck never quite making it to six feet. My hell was his heaven, my heaven his hell. Maybe some snafu of fate or the devils own confidence gave us the opportunities we never had in life. I wasn't going to bang on that door and try to argue my position with anyone. That was for sure.

"[WP] The devil mixed up your paperwork and gave you someone else's personal hell, which to you, is heaven.",Celeries,"(part 2)

But then the laughter quieted down, and the room was silent again. Another thought hit me, one that I didn't say aloud.

Is that... really true? Would my personal hell really be something like that? Is human interaction really my worst nightmare?

""Geez..."" I sat up. That... is really pathetic. Thank god no one was around to hear me entertain something so absurd. But it didn't feel like a lie. I thought back to my life. It's true that I had always been afraid of talking to people. I went out of my way to avoid having to interact with others because it felt safe that way. But the idea that something so ordinary, so common in life, could be a personal hell... was that really how it should be? Why... did I allow that? Why did I let my life become so pathetic?

I thought back to all of the people I had known, people who I imagined being in that personal hell. There were classmates in high school who had tried to talk to me. I had always been quiet in school; people used to make fun of me for saying something stupid or wrong, so I never wanted to risk it. Then there were college professors and career idols that I had wanted to meet for so long, trying to ask me what I was doing and what I had accomplished. And I had always been speechless; I had nothing to tell them. I admired them all, but when the time came for me to make an impression on them, I didn't know what I had to offer. I wasn't special or interesting. They were always treating me so nicely, like I was one of them. But the contrast only made me realize how much of life I had wasted compared to them. It hurt me to feel that way, to stare at my own failures in the eye. Every painful interaction I had ever been in was because of my past failures: misspoken words that I didn't want to repeat, the lack of accomplishment in my life that I felt embarrassed to admit. Was that why I didn't talk to anyone? Was I just scared of facing my own flaws?

""Holy shit it was fucking a joke,"" I yelled suddenly, as if to silence these thoughts. ""You're fucking stupid if you think something like that would be a personal hell, shit!"" I forced a chuckle out. ""That's someone else's heaven, isn't it? People crowding around, wanting to talk to you? Wouldn't people die for that kind of attention? Fuck that shit. That's not a personal hell."" There was silence again. It lasted a few moments.

""Well then..."" I moved onto another subject. ""What would my real personal hell be?"" I tried to think of something more believable for the idea of a personal hell. What would other people's personal hells be like? ""Probably... lots of physical pain. Maybe I'm being tortured by some kind of demon. And... it's really hot and fiery, like hell is usually depicted, right?"" I was proud of myself for going with this instead. This is more normal. Yeah, there's nothing pathetic about the idea of this. Let's keep going.

""I'm probably sweating like crazy, feeling like my brain is about to burst."" Whew! I almost broke a sweat just thinking about it! ""And I'm being cracked with a whip repeatedly."" Damn! Keep going! ""And right when it feels like my body's about to break, they..."" I tried to think of something else, something more painful than a whip. ""...They hook me up to a machine and SHOCK ME!!""

I covered my mouth as my exclamation bounced off of the walls and slowly died away. I realized what was happening now. I was talking, filling the room with my own voice. I was making conversation with myself. By habit, I wanted to talk, to be heard. And in here, the only one to listen was me. To make things worse, if this was really hell, I would be here for eternity... right? There would never be anyone here. I would never be heard again.

Oh.

Suddenly it felt very lonely. It's like I was placed in a corner of existence, dropped off and then left to sit here by myself. I had been tossed aside carelessly, and now I was being forgotten. Would anyone remember I'm here? Did my existence matter to anyone? Is this... how it always was?

I was silent as my mind raced. This isn't how it should be at all. There has to be a way to undo this. If there was only someone here, I could overcome my fear. Right? It's not that hard to just fucking talk. People do it all the time. And even if I say something stupid, what's the worst that could happen? How badly could it really hurt? What was I ever so afraid of?

But those are just thoughts. It's too late now. There's only one chance to live, to determine what kind of afterlife you'll suffer through, to create memories to look back on, and I had doomed myself to exist alone forever. There's no one to hear me or remember me now. Do I really exist at all, then? The truth behind that didn't even matter; there was no one else to care.

No, no no, there's gotta be some way to change. Maybe this is a dream. I can wake up, and when I do, I'll change. I promise I can talk to people, Please, I don't want to be forgotten. I want my life and my voice to mean something. I want people to remember me. I don't want to be ignored. I don't want my only existence to truly be wasted; that would just be proving my fears right. My whole life had been spent worrying that I was worthless, worrying that I was just some weird outcast, and worrying that it might all be true. Running away from that fear had made it the truth. But I can't just accept that, it can't truly be permanent, can it? There's a way to change this, right?!

But the room was silent as I held my breath. I exhaled, and it was true: my slow, melancholy release went unheard throughout all of existence. I wanted to say ""hello?"" just to make sure I was truly alone... but I knew it didn't matter.

I craned my neck up from the floor to look back up at the sign. ""GreenPencil's Personal Hell."" And I turned back to look at the empty room. No one was there. My universe was forever empty. The only presence this room would ever hold was me, alone with my thoughts. And my thoughts were the demons torturing me, whipping me with painful and permanent truths and regrets that I didn't want to hear. ""Fuck,"" I whispered quietly. Assigning me this personal hell wasn't a mistake after all.",Green_Pencil

I could see beyond the doorway, an old house, leaky, crumbling, mouldy. I could smell it from where I stood, it smelled of age, of decay. 

The demon placed a flaming hand on my shoulder, his touch cool on my skin. ""A thousand small jobs, never finished, an infinity of cycling, trying to fix, to clean, to repair."" He grinned at me, sharp teeth flashing. ""I'll be back to check on you in,"" He glanced at the clipboard in his other hand, ""One Thousand Years."" With that, he shoved me, hard, and I stumbled into the room. 

The door slammed shut before I could turn, and as it did, dust filtered down through the gaps in the ceiling above me. I frowned. 

A pile of tools, fresh and new, sat imposingly in the corner. 

Immediately, I began listing out the things to start with, the jobs to prioritise. I looked around, and found a notepad and pen. Smiling, I began to write. 

-

The demon, smug as ever, smiled broadly at me as she led me towards my own ""Personal Hell"" as she described it. She opened a door and waited for me to walk in on my own. 

""Alright, your personal hell is..."" She ran her lit finger down her clipboard. ""A room with nothing practical to do."" She frowned. ""You are Mr. Watson, yes?"" 

I swallowed, and nodded.

""Someone will come to let you out in four hundred years."" She grinned from the doorway. ""Any questions?""

I shook my head. 

She shut the door, and silence enveloped me. The room I stood in was so plain, white walls and white floors, and a single chair. A stack of books lay in the corner, thick tomes which would take weeks to pore over. I smiled. 

-

""What do you mean?"" The devil snapped, slapping a bright blue hand onto his desk. ""How could this happen? Don't we have any plans in place for when people come through with the same name?""

The female demon looked away. ""We do, after the Smith incident it was added to the new starter process, but I think our clipboards must have been mixed up.""

The devil pinched the bridge of his nose. ""We can't open up the rooms until the time is up."" He sighed, leaning back. ""Leave it. Fudge the paperwork.""

The demons exchanged a look, but nodded, and rushed away. They slammed the door behind them, and the devil was alone again.

I slowly nodded, still in absolute shock that Christianity had been the one to get it all right. I mean, heaven and hell? God and The Devil? I had never thought that in a million years what I had done during my life would matter, or that my mother's voice would echo in the back of my head; 'Mind your scripture, Sarah! You don't want to go to Hell!'

""Right this way, Susan.""

The smartly dressed woman in the pencil skirt and blouse began click-click-clicking her way towards one of the many small hallways that led away from the large circular room my death had deposited me in, and I could do nothing but dumbly follow after her on a walk to meet my fate.

Wait, had she called me Susan?

Figuring that she must have just misread my form (and not wanting to get myself into more trouble then I was already in) I kept my mouth shut as I shuffled defeatedly after her. She was smartly running off a list of features; meal times, rewards for time served, and something called a ""redemption program"" that I was too dumbfounded to really take in. Finally after what seemed like an eternity (haha, funny, right?) she stopped outside a simple wooden door and indicated it with a jab of her pen.

""Here we are, Ms. Carter. Thank you for participating in Life, and we are very pleased to be housing you in your own personal Hell. Please, make yourself uncomfortable!""

Fixating on the door I could feel bile rise in my throat along with the dread flooding through me. A shaky hand reached for the door handle, and deciding that if I was going to do this I may as well rip the bandaid off quick I plunged through and slammed the portal shut afterwards. I could hear the solid 'thunk' as some sort of mystical lock slid into place, and with my eyes squeezed shut I accepted my fate.

And that's when I felt it.

Small pinpricks stabbing methodically into my lower shin again and again, just mildly as though to drive me crazy, the nudge of foreign bodies and the brush of soft fur as-- wait.

Hold up.

Soft fur?

My eyes popped open and I couldn't believe what I was seeing -- was this really hell?! It couldn't be! That woman earlier, she had called me Susan; I wasn't Susan, I was Sarah! There must of been a mix-up, a small glitch in the system and--

""Oh thank you, God.""

The words passed my lips with more reverence then ever before as I bent down, scooping the friendly and kneading tabby cat into my arms and pressing my face into it's soft belly, listening to the aggressively loud purring. Letting out a sigh of relief I position the handsome little guy on my shoulders and started forward, eager to pet every single cat in the almost endless field of felines laid out before me.

Susan must have been afraid of cats. This would have been torture to her. Oh well; I mean, the only thing I was ever afraid of was giant killer clowns after all.

13Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: 14Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.

"[WP] The devil mixed up your paperwork and gave you someone else's personal hell, which to you, is heaven.",Celeries,"Long ago, my Sunday school teacher taught me that ""If you commit sin, you'll suffer for all eternity in Hell."" I think she must've been drunk, because this is FANtastic. I died (very sad, boohoo) and I woke up in a hotel lobby. I think the hotel was called 
Hell-iday Inn. Very original. Anyhow, I walk up to the receptionist (a very fine looking demon girl), and she hands me a keycard to a room. ""Hell-o, welcome to Hell. Hope you lament your stay!"" she says as she hands me the card. I make my way to the room, Room 89,352,648,031, and see this very pale, very thin looking guy who had a ""Meat is murder!"" shirt enter the room next to mine. Found the vegan.

I open the door, expecting fire, brimstone, and (post 2000s) Adam Sandler movies on loop alongside the entire discography of some Mongolian throat singing choir. What you'd expect to see. Instead, I see meats of every kind laid out on a table, Woody Allen, Wes Andsrson, Coen Brothers, and many other of the greats movies on loop, and the greatest bands of the 80s and 90s playing in the background. Hell (haha), I thought they messed up and sent me to heaven.

There was another fine demon girl in the room next to the table. ""You're Adam Gallopanoose, correct?"" My name isn't Adam Whateverthehellshesaid, but I didn't want to ruin this small paradise I stumbled upon, so I said yes. So what if I lie? I'm already in Hell. It actually can't get worse then this.

She scribbles something on her clipboard and goes on her way. Now I'm just left to this little piece of blissful damnation for all eternity. I think there was a switch up or something, but I guess the other guy didn't complain about where he ended up. Oh well, I'm just glad I get to enjoy Hell, which is better than what most people can say.

"[WP] The devil mixed up your paperwork and gave you someone else's personal hell, which to you, is heaven.",Celeries,"Before me stretched an impossibly long hallway. Big, imposing, steel bulkhead doors lined the concrete walls. Sickly lights that were evenly spaced along the hallway provided illumination. Everything was in a state of decay. The lights flickered on and off. The steel doors were rusted and some of the tiles on the floor were missing. Bloodcurdling screams could be heard all around you along with twisted laughter and grotesque fapping. It was hard to think in all of this noise.

Satan lead me down the hallway. He had a smug grin plastered on his face and it hadn't changed once since I first met him. The demon was completely red. His entire body was completely red. He was also naked. I didn't dare to ask why.

There were little circular windows on the bulkhead doors. In one room I saw an emaciated old man surrounded by food. Cakes, freshly cooked meat, ripe fruit and glistening wine. It all looked like something right out of a commercial. The man was trying to shove as much food in his face as possible, only to gag and hurl it back out.

In another room there was a woman covered in bloody red eyes. She tore at them with her fingers, screaming as she did so. In yet another, a teenage girl was being surrounded by six little toddlers. Each of them were eyeless, skinless little things that poked at her with hot iron pokers. There seemed to be thousands of these little rooms.

Satan put one burning red hand on my shoulder and guided me onwards. He grinned smuggily. His smug levels seemed to have increased tenfold. I tried to ignore what was poking me in the thigh. Satan led me to a door that looked like all the rest.

""Well, sport! This one's yours. I know it might be a bit hot in the summer, but atleast you don't have to worry about heating bills!"", Satan grinned smugly. He pointed finger pistols at me. I stared at Satan. A man behind me screamed as he was being flayed alive. 

Satan shoved me into my personal cell. ""Enjoy enternal damnation, Mrs. Pierce!"", he said as he disappeared with a poof. The bulkhead closed on it's own and I was faced with my worst nightmares.

Snakes. Thousands of them. They were a piled up on eachother. When I entered the room, they all hissed to greet me. One particularly large cobra was as thick as a tree and as long as seven men. The cobra rose to face level and hissed at me. I slowly raised my fist.

And booped it. On the nose. So many sneks and an enternity to boop them all. My face lit up with a smile. I hugged the cobra, cradling it in my arms. I never noticed how Satan called me Mrs. Pierce. Too many sneks. 

. . . M E A N W H I L E . . .

In front of Mrs. Rachel Pierce was a large football field. The bulkhead door spun shut behind her. The sky was blue, the birds were chirping. Handsome, sweaty football players tackled eachother on the field. When they noticed her, they passed the football to her. She jumped and caught it with both hands, clutching it to her chest. 

""Oi! You weak-legged cunt! Come join us for a game!"", the incredibly buff football player yelled at Mrs. Pierce.

And yes, Mrs. Pierce's legs were particularly weak in this moment. This was her fetish. This was like, all of her fetishes.

She let out a small ""Yesss!"", before joining them with a smile on her face.",Vaconius

"[WP] The devil mixed up your paperwork and gave you someone else's personal hell, which to you, is heaven.",Celeries,"Some time ago I slipped through. I don't remember how or why I died, but here I am, in this blazing stone fortress. They say this is what we called Hell, but there is no punishment in this place for me.

I woke up face-down on the hard, dry ground. What happened...? I thought for a few moments. *Oh yeah.* Car accident. ""Fucking drunk bastard.."" I grumbled to myself. I peered downward and noticed my skin. It was different, dark grey and rough like boiled leather. I shakily stood up and dusted myself off - someone noticed that I was here. Three winged demons decended from the top of a distant tower, wearing heavy plate armor and with longswords in hand. ""Oh fuck, I'm in Hell aren't I?"" The tallest of the armed demons spoke:

""**Shame, Father, for you have sinned.**""

At once they reached out, grabbed me by the limbs and took flight. They carried me to the largest tower in the center of this compound. Entering through an opening near the top, they dropped me to the floor at the foot of a large stone stairway. The demons landed beside me and took my arms.

""**Walk.**""

We ascended the stairway to a massive doorway left open and entered a colossal chamber. The room was about the size of a warehouse and hexagonal in shape with large braziers lit in each of the six corners of the room. A pyramid of stairs came together into a platform at the center of the room, and upon it sat a large chair of bronze, stained with old blood and soot, and apholstered with dark red silk. In that chair sat the master of this realm - a large humanoid figure with dragon-like features.

*Fuck me.* I was in the throne room of Satan himself.

""***You've come a long way to find yourself here, Cardinal.***""

*Cardinal*? I thought. *Does he think I'm someone...*

Before I could finish my thought, he proclaimed:

""***You hunted my demons, you banished my phantoms, and you lived a life in faithful servitude to the Bastard Father above - For that, you shall serve me for all of Eternity!***""

He waved his massive claw and a searing pain shot through my spine. I felt the skin of my back stretch and began to rupture as bones shot outwards and pierced my flesh. My ashen skin quickly grew over the new bone structures and suddenly, *I could feel them. They were wings.*

The demon servants grabbed me once more and dragged me out of the room, down the stairs and to the opening to the outside. The largest demon stomped his foot to the ground, and a large wooden chest formed in a cloud of mist.

""**Take your equipment, demon.**""

*Demon... I am a demon...!*

I could already feel a great strength coursing through me.

I opened the chest and found plate armor identical to those worn by the three around me, as well as a black steel longsword. I donned my gear and lifted the sword above my head. The suit fit perfectly and the blade was light and effortless to swing. Seeing that I was ready, the demons walked to the edge of the opening.

""**Work to do, sinners need punishment. You follow us, we teach you.**""

As they took to the air, I stretched my wings and followed.

I have been here for more Earth years then I could any longer count. It did not take long for Lord Satan to realize that I was not the clergyman that he thought I was, but it did not matter. I was intended to go to Heaven, and I landed right where I was supposed to. The people who find themselves here *deserve* to be here - they deserve punishment, and I am the hand of unholy justice that provides it.

That's the last thing I remembered when I woke in the darkness. Heat and this agonizing pulling sensation, then...nothing. As the moments passed, trying in vain to see into the blackness, I remembered the last few seconds. The TSA guys yelling. The guy with the beard throwing his arms up and yelling something about Allah. The flash--and I realized two things. I wasn't hurting, and I was probably dead.

I guess that realization was the trigger. Slowly my vision filled with white light. It was wrong in some way I can't explain...my eyes hurt to see it. Then a figure came into focus before me. One minute all I could see was the white, the next...it was like he just resolved out of the the light itself.

He stood a head taller than me. His broad shoulders and thick neck hinted at tremendous strength. In my head I could tell that he should be beautiful, but something in my subconscious screamed that this being was terrifying. His wings unfolded behind him as he loomed over me. I couldn't help but drop to my knees in fear.

""Do you know who I am, boy?""

""Y-- you're--""

""I am Lucifer!"" Rolling thunder emphasized his announcement. I would have found it ridiculous if it weren't so real. ""And you, Abdul bin Abadi, are my latest subject. You expected 72 virgins and the praise of your beloved Allah. Now you learn the true value of your act!""

""I'm not--""

""It's no use denying your fate. You cannot escape the consequences of your actions! You adhered strictly to your faith for decades, and then you used that faith to justify the slaughter of innocents.""

""No really, I'm--""

""SILENCE! You expected seventy-two virgins. You instead bought yourself seventy-two Jewish whores! When you hunger, there will nothing but bacon and when you thirst, nothing but beer."" 

I stared at him, trying to understand what I was hearing. I fought to suppress the smile that fought to creep across my face. Finally I lowered my head.

""I was promises paradise with Allah! This cannot be possible!"" I felt hands grab me from behind. I half-heartedly fought against them. I needed to sell it. ""No! This cannot be! Nooooooo!""

I landed on a pile of pillows. I lifted my head and found myself surrounded by voluptuous Jewish women. One of them handed me a beer. Another fed me a piece of bacon.

It's been quite an eternity. The funny thing is, if Abdul ended up getting my spot in Heaven, it's probably not much different than this.",ftbc

She grabbed me by the hand and pushed me through the door behind her desk. As I stumbled into the sunlight I heard a voice say, ""See you in a hundred years"". The sun was warm on my face. There was a smell in the air, a familiar smell. One I hadn't smelled in awhile. I was in the woods standing in front of an old cabin. I walked up the ricket old steps and inside. The cabin was sparse, a woodstove, wash basin, bed, and oil lamps. Walking out the back I noticed yet another porch with some old fly rods and reels. A lake stood before me surrounded by pines. Fish jumping and loons calling I walked down to the boat that sat at an old wooden dock. Looking to my right I see another cabin with a young girl suning herself. She was stunning, very far out of my league. She waved and asked if Id be over for drinks later. Shrugging I yelled, ""alright"". Bewilderment couldn't explain what I feel. Walking back to the cabin I proceed inside and sit down on the bed with a flop. A lone cell phone sat on the night stand. I picked it up out of curiousity and lo and behold. There is no service, I try to check reddit but nothing. I smile and lay on the old dusty pillow wondering what the hell kind of person that boy was. If this was his hell his life must have been very different from mine. Then it dawned on me...pines, the smell is pine trees in the summer. I began to doze off to sleep with a smile on my face.

Of all the possible belief systems to be right, why did it have to be the one that promised an eternity of unwanted existence?

Before me was a huge metal door and a tiny, blood-red demon fluttering clumsily. 

""So John, you know where you are? Why you are here?"", it said, with a like-sized clipboard and pen in its possession.

I said yes to both questions. When I was alive I suffered from many diseases - from HIV to diabetes. I didn't have the money to have someone in my care, so I drained away in my tiny apartment. Life was shit anyway, with no family and friends to live for; I was dying to die.

""Oh great."", it said. The demon then muttered something and the metal door began to open slowly.

Beyond it I see a room the size of a standard swimming pool. There weren't many furniture present aside from a long table and a few stools, but the elephant in the room were definitely the clowns. Seven foot clowns with portruding bellies, curly orange wigs, wrinkled foreheads. 

I was shoved inside by some magical force and the door behind me started to close. I never really was deathly afraid of clowns, but I would be lying if I said I wasn't a bit intimidated by them.

""Welcome to our turf."", their voices echoed, sounding ghostly and high-pitched. I said nothing. One of them continued: ""We don't really do much here, but we heard that you have severe anxiety and a phobia for clowns. Is that true?"" 

""I guess so, yeah."", I lied. But I didn't want to face anything scarier. Knowing Hell, they'd want to make you suffer eternally. This actually doesn't seem too bad.

""BOO!"", they boomed, laughing boisterously afterwards. I guess this would've scared someone to death, but all it did was make me cringe. They don't seem smart, they don't look good at all, but hey...

Perhaps they can keep me company.

However it seems they changed their minds because the place I was put was as far away from hell as I could immagine. I was surrounded by all my friends from highschool, and each evening there was a different kind of event I could go to. Parties, concerts, cinema's... you name it. Hell kind of reminded me of an eternal school trip. 

I never had to worry about money, food or shelter, it was all provided. The shelter I was given was a near exact replica of the schooltrip I had when I was 16. A shared room with 5 others, the room however was the one this weird guy named Padge from school got because his parents wouldn't let him go if he didn't have a room with airconditioning. 

Another weird thing was that the food existed out of a very limited variety. Most of the food that was provided was quite sour of taste, I didn't mind though. I always had a taste for those kind of dishes. 

If I knew this was how hell would be I would have taken care that I would have gotten here sooner. In real life I could barely afford bread on the table, my ex had cheated on me and my parents had kicked me out of the house at age 15, whereafter I had been couch surfing at friends places everytime with a different excuse. 

After yet another long night of partying I returned to my room, catching one of my roommates making out in the corner of the hallway with Theresa, the only girl who ever bothered to hang out with Padge.

"[WP] The devil mixed up your paperwork and gave you someone else's personal hell, which to you, is heaven.",Celeries,"I tried to imagine two men. Both men were trapped in a life by their own inaction. One couldn't stop himself, the other couldn't stand up for himself to stop someone else. 

One exemplified gluttony, as someone who had nothing but consumed every last ounce of what he had. Food was his substitute for life. His family was his plate and utensils. His friends the the food that ushered him to his doom. 

The other was sloth for having everything but consuming nothing of life. He remained a waif, counting calories, ever avoiding uncleanliness, and always stuck fitting his mother's ideals, which often meant being outgoing when he preferred solitude. Each was trapped in that life, in life. 

In death they were able to realize their dreams one man was given the opportunity to be bigger, to not have the constant worry of criticism from an overbearing parent, to be able to be able to eat junk food and wallow in a mess of his own making, to be huge and clumsy and careless, and to not have the constant jeers of people and have to live in the watchful eyes of others out in the open. The other could be naturally thin, something he'd never ever been, know what it meant to live in a clean environment, see what it meant to be social, to live outside of the bounds of the social structure his mother had doomed him to by accident of birth, but he had allowed to continue because he prioritized food over all else.

"[WP] The devil mixed up your paperwork and gave you someone else's personal hell, which to you, is heaven.",Celeries,"Blackness burns away in the light, and after your eyes adjust, there appears to be nothing but white. You begin to hear a voice, possibly female, but can't make out the words. Color slowly blossoms and forms shapes. A table, a row of seats lined up against what must have be a wall, and numerous other blobs of color and shape without distinct features. The speech becomes clearer, and you take in the sight of a secretary seated behind a sliding-glass window giving instructions to a color blob that seemed human in shape. 

To the left of the window is a large, unassuming yet somehow ominous door. There is nothing to indicate where it leads, only a white sign with black letters that reads:

 Wait To Enter Until Called -Unaccompanied Entrants Will Be Subject To Punishment. 

It is the only door in the room.         
You focus your attention on the secretary, who also looks human but has skin so pale that you can see the thin, blue veins beneath her flesh. In contrast, she has dark eyes and dark hair pulled back into a tight bun. In combination with her high cheekbones and sharp chin she's an eerie sight to behold.
 Nevertheless, you've stepped up to the window and give your name. She wordlessly files through papers and just as you begin to wonder if you actually have an appointment, she says, ""Ah yes, here you are."" She frowns. ""You're not expected for another hour. Take a seat and fill out this paperwork."" She hands you a clipboard with a half-inch thick stack of papers and you turn around to find a seat.

 The shapes and colors have sorted themselves out, mostly- you are definitely in the waiting room of a doctor's office. There are even pamphlets on the end tables with ridiculous titles like ""Life after Death"" and ""I've Died- What Now?"" as well as HellTimes magazine and D&amp;F: Dead and Fabulous. There is also a lonely looking playset in the corner, with a few dusty toys scattered around. 
The only things you can't clearly see are the other inhabitants of the room. Blurs of color and vague shapes nestled in chairs are all you can make out, along with the sound of pens scribbling on paper. 

You turn your attention to the paperwork in your hands; there are the typical feilds, such as name, date of birth, parent's names, etc. 
Then, there were somewhat personal questions, like ""who was your favorite family member"" or ""your childhood best friend?"" and ""what did you want to be when you grew up?"" 
But there were also feilds such as ""weirdest fear"", ""saddest memory"" and paragraph sections for recurring nightmares, and deepest regrets. Why wouldn't they know this stuff already? Isn't this the afterlife? 
You answer what you remember, and skip over anything that seems strange (most of it) and spend the rest of the time glancing over the blurs in the room. 

You're wishing you could just see a face, a normal one- when you notice a newly-arrived blur sit next to you. You detect the sounds of writing. Are they writing their name? You wonder if, like you, they would leave some lines blank. 
The blur sets the clipboard on the arms of the chairs that separate you and rises, proceedes to the window. 
You can hardly believe your luck- now is your chance! 

You pick up the foreign clipboard and begin reading. This person has filled out a lot more than you, that's for sure. It's a whole documented map of this person! Most of the fears you find funny, the disappointments seem like lessons worth learning, and the personal accounts of loved ones are truly touching. 

You've read through a large chunk of it before you realize that the pale receptionist is speaking sternly to you and grabbing you under your shoulder. You resist, and her grip slides down to your arm. She manages to pull you out of your seat despite her sparse appearance, and takes the clipboard out of your hand. You stammer in an attempt to explain yourself but she cuts you off- 

""It's time for your appointment. Now let's see-"" she glances at the forms as she pushes you toward the door- ""oh yes. You'll be seeing a specialist. 
Just follow the orderly here, and don't get sidetracked-"" she smiles, ""there are many horrors to behold along the way. Mustn't get lost.""",Okaylasttime

Beside me were my brothers; hundreds of them.  All as primed for battle as I, and all armed with their respective instrument of death. Across the field stood guostly figures barely visible behind the shroud of white mist. A loud cry pierced the sky behind me and we charged forward at the figures, hoping that the deeds and death that occur on this day may appease the gods for one more day. An Englishman in the  ""King's"" armor came into range of my battle axe and I lifted it above my shoulder and brought it down hard on the Saxon's shield shattering the piece of wood along with his arm behind it. A strong kick to the chest sent the weakling to the tundra.  After that he was as easy to kill as a turtle on its shell.  I looked forward to the wall of potential opponents and grinned, for him each kill is as euphoric and addicting as the first. I brought back my axe a second time for the next Saxon and an  arrow lodged in my chest. It just seemed to appear intently like it spontaneously grew from my coat. 
       Archery seem to be the only quality keeping the ""King"" in power. I stood in my shame, how could I be outsmarted my a lucky shot of a damn Englishman, the frustration made a dull pain in my chest just overpowering the pain of the hole in my breastplate. I feel to the tundra, forcing the arrow deeper into my body. The white of the fog that onced contrasted the deaths and killings of my brothers, grew in opeaqueness, and now hid the bodies of the fallen around me, my last view will be of a faded battle to go down in the saga's of my children.

""I shall see them again in valhalla...""

I awoke in a small room build of blackened slate stone, I could feel the radiating heat of the open air furnace to the side of me on my bare skin and noticed that my coat and armor vanished, the puncture wound remained but didn't bleed. A feeble English looking man sat behind a hollow wooden block scattered with papers that resembled what the Englishman use.
    ""Sit,"" the man said.
    ""I take orders from no man.""
    ""Calm yourself, aggression will get you know where her."" He said with out looking up.
    ""And where is here?"" I asked reaching for my missing axe and became painfully aware of my vulnerability.  
   ""Hell... heathen."" The man said.
         I opened my mouth to shout and was cut off, his calm demeanor from such a small man was off putting.
    ""Listen, before anything else I'm going to admit our mistake. Some one down in enrolment gave you some one else's eternal damnation.""
    ""What afterlife is this, where are my shield bro-""
    ""Let me finish!"" The man said. He looked up from his papers and his eyes were black and empty. ""You'll be filling the place of Curt Blanche, age 76, odd age to kill yourself. I guess some can't handle their PTSD"" 
    ""I don't understand,"" I interrupted again. He seamed to grip his writing quill tighter each time I interrupted. 
    ""Shut your damn mouth."" He slammed his hand into the wood.
       ""If you let me finish,  I can say that because of our mess up, your eternal hell will be war! Killing and dieing again and again until you break in the fire of the the Prince of Darkness.""
   ""I'm transcending to valhalla?"" I said with confused relievement.
   ""Oh no, your going where valhalla looks like C.O.D."" The man leaned forward.
     ""Boy, you're going to 'Nam.""",abricastaniel

"[WP] The devil mixed up your paperwork and gave you someone else's personal hell, which to you, is heaven.",Celeries,"""You have led a very bad life"" I heard Satan say in a husky voice. ""As such, you have been put in charge of the Vanilla Sex Department, and have been assigned as my personal assistant. Do you understand Miss Charles?"" I look up at Satan and nodd before I even think.

""Good. You're to start by training new demons. Well, more like they'll be training you, amirite?"" He then elbowed me playfully. I was a bit confused as to why he would be sto friendly, but I let it slide. I was quiclky handed a clipboard and sent down a hallway.

I entered a room full of incubi. It was odd, because I thought they would all look like juicers and have no necks, but they were all very lithe.

""Umm... Miss?""

""Yes?""

""This has been hard for a while now,"" an incubus said, pointing to his erection, ""what should I do with this?""

""Well, take these clothes off me and I'll teach you."" I said with a smirk.

""Me too! Me too!"" The other incubi all chime in.

""Boys! Boys! Calm down! I can teach all of you, don't worry. You'll all be wonderful incubi."" And with that I bent over and began my first lesson: The Mechanics of Sex.

It took about a month, but I successfully taught the incubi to be both seductive and forceful, according to what the situation required. I pressed the intercom button to tell Satan my progress. I knew he wouldn't mind a month of silence. Satan is the kind of guy who has a lot going on, and he almost always plays the long game.

""Satan?""

""Yes?"" He inquired a little impatiently.

""I just finished training the incubi. They should be ready for service in the Vanilla Department.""

""Wel that was quick. How did it go?""

""They were a bunch of sweethearts. I quite enjoyed myself.""

""Wait. What?"" Only then did I realize my slip-up. ""I'm coming down there right now, wiat for me.""

I suddenly panic. I don't want this taken away from me. When Satan showed up, all the incubi froze in fear.

""Go on to your assignments boys. Check the schedule outside the door."" Satan hadn't looked at me once since he entered the room, and I still wasn't used to his husky voice. It crossed my mind that I may never be used to it, and I did have all of eternity before me to find that out.

""You. Come here."" Satan said after the incubi left. He still wasn't looking at me.

""Yes sir?"" I always use formal language when I'm nervous or frightened.

""What is your real name?"" He sounded deflated all of a sudden. I wasn't expecting emotional diversity to come from the king of hell.

""Ainsly Todd. Middle name Raven.""

""Fuck. That means Miss Charles is in heaven right now.""

""Really? How so?""

""Well, your room is an echo chamber of angry, sex negative SJW's. The room also has an echo to it. So it's an echo chamber echo chamber. I thought that was pretty cool. Anyway, that room is perfect for Miss Charles. She must be loving  it.""

""Well,"" I say, stunned, ""I can see how that room would've been hell for me. I suppose you have to fix this, now that you know?""

""Not necessarily. I want to get a report on the incubi you just trained after they've done a year of service. If you're useful enough, it can make up for the fact that you're not suffering.""

""So what do I do in between?""

""Well,"" Satan fidgeted, looking at his feet now, ""there are a LOT of succubi that need training. You could get started on that. Apparently females are much more popular sexually, with both sexes. I couldn't tell you why though, I don't even know myself.""

""So how many succubi are we talking about?""

""About a year's worth to train. Don't worry though, you can train them in batches if it makes things easier.""

I nodded, trying not to look too happy, but a smirk got through. I'm really good with women, I can't help it.

""I'll come back when you're finished. See you in about a year."" As he said this he was already turning around, one hand raised in goodbye.

""Yeah."" I said weakly as the door closed behind Satan. This was all very confusing to me. Nothing he did made any sense. I thought Satan would just be a ball of rage. I didn't have time to dwell on it though, I had to go introduce myself to my first batch of succubi.

As the year came to an end, I was very happy with my last batch of succubi. It was time to page Satan again.

""Satan?""

""Yeah?""

""Ainsley Todd here. Just dismissed the last batch of succubi to begin work.""

""Oh! Good! I'll be right over!""

My brow furrowed in confusion. Satan sounded rather excited about seeing me. Then again, I could just be imagining things, as I so often do.

""Ok!"" Satan said rather breathlessly when he entered the room. ""I got the report on that batch of incubi you trained a year agao. They are doing stellar work, and they are loving it!""

""So?"" I ask, nervously. I really don't want to be thrown into the echo chamber echo chamber. And I still wasn't used to that husky voice.

""You can stay on here."" I notice him staring at his hands nervously.

""What about Miss Charles?""

""Oh, that was an easy fix. I taped her mouth shut and put her in a conservative echo chamber echo chamber. Yeah, it's not often we find gems like you, though. People who are useful to us when they're not being tortured."" He looked at me then, and gave a sheepish smile.

""There's still one more thing to sort out."" He said, looking down again.

""Yes?"" I inquired after I noticed he wasn't going to speak on his own.

""Do you remember when I said you were assigned to be my personal assistant?"" I nodded, not quite sure what he was trying to get at. ""Well, I require services occasionally, but I don't fancy succubi.""

""Really?""

""They can be so impersonal sometimes. I can't handle that myself. So I was wondering if you could..."" 

""Yeah?"" I said softly, taking moving slowly towards Satan as if he were a very skittish creature.

""Well, uh..... Couldyoublowme?""

I stood, mouth agape, for a few seconds. Satan, of all people, was nervous asking for a sexual favour. When he had hundreds of sexual demons under his control, and could have sex with practically any of his prisoners as part of their torture if he so chose.

He looked visibly hurt when I didn't answere right away. He turned and was about to leave, when I grabbed him by the arm.

""Wait!"" I said as I turned him around.

""What?"" He said, sullenly.

""I'm sorry. I was just surprised you felt the need to ask. Being fully honest, giving head is my absolute favourite thing to do &lt;3.""

""What? Really?"" He asked, his voice suddenly inflated with life and emotion.

""Really, really."" I said with a straight face. ""may I do that now?"" I ask, looking for the first time at this creature's penis, which is only slightly larger than the average human's. It looked absolutely delicious, and more than ready for some attention.

""No!"" He snapped, acting defensively. ""I mean, not right now. I would rather we go back to my main office and quarters for that.""

""Oh, ok, let's go do that now then.""

First of all, I was right. Satan absolutely was delicious. Secondly, despite hosting all the worst of the world, he seemed rather inexperienced himself.

Sex with Satan became a regular occurence, any time I had free really. I was moved from training to scheduling and administration fo the Vanilla Department.

After a few months of this, we had gotten to talking a lot after sex. I'll spare the boring details, and tell you about the most important pillow talk of my whole afterlife so far.

I had just gotten a really good pounding, and was in a completely relaxed state, lying next to Satan.

""I think I'm in love with you."" He said suddenly.

""I think I am too."" I say. ""But it's really weird, though."" He looks over at me. ""What I mean to say is: you're Satan. You're supposed to be this scary, angry guy, who can torture all the bad poeople in the world, so how can you possibly fall in love?""

""Well,there's actually nothing saying I have to be angry. I mean, look at what gets you into heaven! It's all so stoic and full of thinking of others! It's all about thinking of the future and sucking the very MARROW out of life! I don't know how anyone could possibly live in such a dry, emotionless life! Do you know? I've never heard of anyone going to heaven! I'm not even sure if it's real anymore. If I had to go to heaven, that would be hell for me, though. It only makes sense that I have emotions, and a lot of them, when people in heaven are supposed to deny all of theirs.""

I looked at him then, for a good, long moment, and then I kissed Satan, passionately. I knew I wouldn't be able to respond to something that viceral with words, so I showed him. I showed him that I too had passion, that I knew what he meant. I poured all my love into the most hated creature in the universe. Finally, after kissing him till I was breathless, did I finally find that there actually were words to describe why I loved Satan.

My dad was sick. His heart was going bad. I went with him to the cardiac surgeon to discuss having a new valve installed. Unfortunately his health was already too far deteriorated. The surgery itself would probably kill him. There was nothing the doctor could do. It was time to go home to die.

I was in shock, of course. I was wheeling my dads chair down an immensely long hallway that seemed to stretch forever like a movie effect, a wall of windows on the right, and a kind of white noise in my head. 

My dad was going to die, and there was nothing anyone could do about it.

Suddenly, deadpan as can be he said ""Well, I guess I won't be buying any more green bananas!""

May 31st will be 15 years since he passed.

""Jerry,"" he said. ""There are so many things in life I wish I could guide you through.""

""It's okay, Dad,"" I replied, holding back tears. ""I'm seventeen. I'll figure out things myself.""

He smiled at me, a subtle smile that said *I'm proud of you*. ""But let me tell you one more thing, son.""

""Sure, Dad.""

""Never trust an atom.""

Immediately, I became worried about if he was hallucinating, but I just wanted to answer one last time. ""Why?""

""They make everything up!"" He laughed, and the gentle beeping was replaced by a low droning sound. ",_John_Locke_4815
"[WP] Upon his deathbed, your father's last words to you is the worst dad joke you've ever heard.",DKLancer,"The room was full. Sadly, hospital rooms are not built for this type of reunion. 

They were all here. His parents, his surviving sister, and both his brothers, even Uncle Mike in his wheel chair. My sister and her husband, my brother and his wife, even my soon to be ex-wife arrived. In my head, all I could think was, ""This is what it takes to see my family.""

Dad was in his bed, the center of attention. Just how he wanted things. Tubes ran to machines. Air pushed in and out for the tubes in his nose. One collapsed lung, with the other set to go at any time. 

We were all here, waiting. His last day, his rules, and his speech. He chose this day to go. He spoke slow ... picking out individuals and saying a last word to each. I wish I had the chance to listen. 

As the eldest son, and his employee, I had all the responsibilities. The DNR was in place ... he asked that first thing, and I could only nod. You didn't interrupt Dad.

My cell phone rang ... his sale of a property was to close the next day. He worked right to the end. He vowed to care of everything before he ""left"". I took the call, while he continued his speech to our family. I took notes, they got to listen.

When I hung up, he was half done. He glanced at me, and I just nodded. Everything was alright, the nod said, he just continued, not missing a beat. We had worked together so long, we could have whole conversations with just a glance. 

My phone rang again ... The lawyer. I took the call, I had to, in spite of the glances from my brother and sister. Work still went on. This was a problem though. He saw the look on my face, and he paused. 

He simply said to me, ""What?"" The whole family looked at me.

""There is an issue with the title. The lawyer says there is a meeting tomorrow at 11:00 am.""

Dad simply said, ""You're going to have to go. I won't be here.""

We just looked at each other and smiled.

"[WP] Upon his deathbed, your father's last words to you is the worst dad joke you've ever heard.",DKLancer,"My father's illness has been tough on my whole family.  It's hard to watch someone who you love and respect, a mountain of a man, slip away mentally.  His body looks the same so every time he walked into a room there would be a fleeting second where you would forget, where you'd expect the old dad.  Then he'd start talking and it would hit you like a ton of bricks.  He wasn't there anymore and he wasn't coming back.

When we finally had to hospitalize him, everyone came to visit at first.  His room was always full of family and friends.  But as he progressed and started to slip away more and more, he got meaner.  He'd say horrible things and, slowly but surely, people stopped coming.  For a while it was just me and mom but eventually she couldn't bear it anymore either and I was the only one left.

It was on one of those days, when I had been alone with him for hours, that it happened.  I knew the end was coming; he had been babbling incoherently pausing only to hurl insults at the nurses who came in to check on him.  All of a sudden he stopped and got this look on his face.  It could only be described as lucidity, but he looked scared too.  He saw me sitting next to him and said ""Son, what's happening to me?""

I couldn't lie to him.  The man had spent my whole life telling me how important the truth was and I wouldn't let my last words to him be a lie.  So I looked him in the eyes, put my hand on his and said ""Dad, I'm so sorry.  You're dying.""  He looked back and me with the most earnest expression I had ever seen and said his final words on earth.  ""Son, I can't be dying.  I'm already Dad.""",Solongsweetheart

""Nathan, can you please put your phone away? I'm trying to teach a class- unless you'd like to come up here and teach it yourself?""
 
""No, Mrs. Fey. I'm sorry. It won't happen again,"" I said. I ended the call without checking who the caller was. Just last week, my phone was taken away because I was using it during class. I didn't want to lose it again.

*Bzzzt. Bzzzzzt.*

*Bzzzt. Bzzzzzt.*

I quickly silenced the phone in my pocket. Mrs. Fey glanced in my direction but didn't comment. Thank goodness. A second call? Who could possibly try to get ahold of me during school hours? The class had only just begun. Perhaps the caller was trying to reach me before 3rd period had started. Oh well. Whoever it was had just missed me. He or she can wait until after class.

As soon as the bell rang, I checked my phone, curious to see who this trouble maker was.

*10 missed calls from mom.*

""What's wrong?"" Mrs. Fey asked when she saw the fear in my eyes. ""You look upset."" 

Before I could answer, my older sister had walked into the classroom.

""It's dad,"" she said. There was a sort of choking sound in her voice. ""We have to go to the hospital right now.""

I didn't ask any questions. I couldn't. I just followed her out to the car and rode with her to the hospital. Once there, we rushed inside the building. My sister must have been here already because she didn't even stop to ask what room he was in. 

On the way to the hospital, I thought the car ride would never end. It was the longest wait I have known in my entire life. That is until we rode the elevator. It was full, cramped, almost bursting at the seems. Everyone had somewhere they wanted to be, someone they wanted to see. Their floors were pushed first, so we had to shift and shuffle on and off to let people reach their destinations. 

Once we reached our floor, my sister led the way, weaving around doctors, nurses, and carts on her way to my father's room. We were nearing the end of the hall when she stopped. She turned to face me. Her eyes were flooding. Her mouth opened a bit, but she didn't say anything. Finally, she took my hand firmly, almost painfully, and led me into the room.

The first thing I noticed was my father's face. He looked pale and sickly. My mother was kneeling by the bedside crying and holding his hand. 

""Dad!"" The words burst out in stark terror, but I was having trouble forming them into proper ideas. ""W- What- problem- alright?""

His voice was frail and wavering. ""They said I have cardio- myo-something. It's a type of heart failure. I got myself so worked up that my heart just kind of gave out. They won't be able to get me a new heart in time. It's not looking good, kiddo.""

""Worked up? What were you doing? You're the calmest person I know."" 

""I was hunting frogs with Paul. This one big frog, the bastard, just kept slipping out of my grasp. I was hopping mad."" 

My face betrayed the beginnings of a smile. The situation was horrible, but I couldn't help but appreciate his sense of humor. 

""You shouldn't joke like that,"" I added.

""Joke? I can hardly speak with this frog in my throat.""

""Dad, please.""

""This is a real boiling frog.""

""Dad.""

""I can't believe I'm gonna croak.""

""Dad! Don't say that. The jokes are bad enough. I want to talk with you before we can't anymore. I want to know about anything you can tell me. I want you to tell me things you were going to save until I was older. Tell me some of the most important things you've learned from life. Tell me what to watch out for. Tell me everything will be all right. Do you hear me? Do you understand?""

""Toad-ally,"" he said, emphasizing the word 'toad'.

As soon as the word had left his lips, the heartbeat monitor played that horrible constant note that meant he was gone forever. And the last thing my father ever said to me was a horrible frog pun.",Wozing
"[WP] Upon his deathbed, your father's last words to you is the worst dad joke you've ever heard.",DKLancer,"At first I never thought I would stop crying, but dad was never one to leave a room without a laugh. Which is why, in hindsight, dad's mic drop was just as perfect as him.

To put it bluntly, dad knew he was dying. And in the event you didn't, he would make light of the situation just like he always did.

""Tell me about your day,"" he'd say.

""Oh you know, my bus was delayed 30 minutes, the coffee was burned, and I had to work late.""

""Is that it?"" He'd ask.

""Yeah.""

""Well,"" he'd say after a slight pause, ""I'm dying more today than yesterday.""

""Come on dad, stay positive.""

""No, seriously. If you keep sharing boring stories like that, I'm going to die faster.""

Finally, on his last day, the family gathered round. The outlook was already grim, so we knew any chance to speak to him could be the last. Only dad knew for sure.

He shared some words privately with mom. They kissed like newlyweds on the daily, and his final moments wouldn't change that one bit. Despite the severity of the situation, she slipped out past the curtain laughing and wiping tears from her eyes. 

Then, a few moments with my sister, in which he apologized for not being able to see her grow up. And yet, she left laughing. 


Finally, it was my turn. 

""Don't tell me another one of your lame day recaps. I only have so much time left.""

""I won't dad. I promise.""

""Son,"" he said, in all seriousness. ""I love you. And I'm going to miss you."" Then a pause. ""Did I ever tell you about the time I met a mute at a bar?""

I laughed just a little, knowing this was going to be another one of those dad moments.

""No dad, you didn't. But it better be good. I don't need any time taken off my life.""

""Laughter is the best medicine, but I'm afraid I've built a bit of a resistance to it. You on the other hand will be fine.""

""So,"" he continued, ""I'm in Danang, not long after a tour in Cambodia. There was this short little mute who worked at a bar there that served drinks. Nice guy, but dumb as bricks. Anyway, a lot of people thought it was a language barrier. Fact is, he couldn't speak any language. But I thought I could crack him. I really did. So I pull him aside and the whole room is now watching. I drop my best Vietnamese on him, mix in some English, and even a little Chinese for good measure. I saw him purse his lips, and swallow hard. There was something building up inside him. You could just feel the anticipation growing. And so I leaned in closer and do you know what he said?""

I rolled my eyes jokingly, as I always did with my father. Finally, ""What did the mute bartender say dad?""

Dad died on a Tuesday at 9:54 PM. ",OldMackysBackInTown
"[WP] Upon his deathbed, your father's last words to you is the worst dad joke you've ever heard.",DKLancer,"Noone came to see Dad for the last time. Vera, my younger sister claimed that she was busy with her kids. Mother had already divorced, and she had assumed that because of that she would not get any properties or money from Dad. Both Mother and Vera had left us when I was only 7 years old,  so I'm guessing that it would be awkward if they came, so maybe that's why they didn't come.

Scratch that. They're just assholes.

Dad has a forgiving nature, and I'm sure he would have forgiven them now, after all, he being bedridden and literally on his deathbed. 

The room was extremely quiet, and i didn't know what to say to him. Do I say that I'll miss him? Say that it's not his fault that none of them came, even though Dad had written a hand-written apology, heartfelt and true, to both of them? Just last week he had ordered me to give two hand written cards, both scrawled with words and a smiley face to those vermins. Considering the fact that Dad could hardly hold a fork to eat, it was an admirable effort. Something in me stung, he always loved Vera more than me.

Suddenly, i see movement out of the corner of my eye. It was Dad, weakly holding his hand up to me, gesturing me to come closer to him. Hastily wiping away any stray tears, I moved in closer to him. 

""Anna, when I die, bury me at the graveyard near the park where you loved to play. Did you know,"" he wheezed, obviously struggling to even speak,""people are just dying to get in there.""

Recollecting events now, it all seems to have happened within days, hours, minutes, as memories do. It didn't; I can't remember the collective trauma of those months condensed into what there is, and what I know. I remember being told he had cancer. A very late stage. He decided not to go through treatment, because he'd seen the state that it put people in. If it were to buy him some time, it would be a discount price knock-off brand, that nobody who had experienced the luxury of happy memories could ever stoop to. Maybe on Ebay, from a seller with hardly any positive feedback. You can't trust it, that time. Every minute is someone else's, because you are someone else. And I love my dad, because he is him. He is still him.

But now it's over. Winter is over. It really overstepped its boundaries, but that's British weather. A month of extra cold, of extra difficulty. But it was another month I had with my dad, so I can't complain. And now, maybe, we'll get some memories in Spring's sun. He called me up earlier, and apparently he's getting better. Actually getting better. Doctor-certified getting better. He said it was what he'd been struggling for; that all this time, he knew he just had to make it to this day. This was his goal. The day he would get better. So I'm going to see him now. He made sure I'd come this morning. There will be a doctor there later in the day.

I enter the house. I call out, and I hear an audible reply from his room upstairs. Audible, but fainter than I'd hoped. I remind myself he's only recently been on the mend, and has been quite badly ill for some time before that. He's not going to be suddenly better. I walk up the stairs, with each step wondering exactly how he'll be. I remember how he was last week, and looking back he was definitely a bit better than the week before. I just hadn't noticed it then. Heck, they said he'd be dead by March. He's a month past that, now. One month at a time, he'll keep living. It's that determination of his; he's made it to this point, where he believes he can get better again. Now he just has to keep going.

I knock, and trudge into the bedroom, and he seems happier than he's ever been. Not better, but happier. His skin is more pale than before, but that smile stretches so much further that he can't possibly be in more pain. There is no need for greetings, as I feel as though I've been in this room ever since he regressed to being bed-bound. But he's the first to talk, if such strenuous exercise on his part can really be reduced to ""talking"".

""Son. Do... do you really believe I'm getting better? I feel as though I am, if that makes sense. I'm more myself."" He coughs a little, as though to illustrate the opposite.  
""Yes,"" I wholeheartedly reply, ""Yes, this is what you've been working towards, right? The point at which you'll get better. You've always said this. You stay alive till that day, and then you're bound to survive it all."" He stifles laughter, and I wonder what words he's about to force out of his mouth next.  
""Well, son. That's... that's half true. I wanted to live to this day. And that was what kept me breathing, what kept me going."" I look about, worried in anticipation of what might be coming next. Nothing new in his room; just the stuff on his bedside table as normal. His old radio, a number of cards, the flip calendar we got him- nothing out of place. He continues, ""But, it's... You really believe I can get better? You're not just pretending, to make me feel better?""  
""Of course!"" I immediately reply. I want to believe, but I worry my dad no longer does.  
""Then, pl-"" He interrupts himself choking, but manages to collect himself before I feel the need to step in. ""Then, please... could you flip the date over on my calendar? It's a little too fa... too far for me to reach."" He seemed so much weaker than when I first walked in, as though in these last few minutes I had relived the months past. I flip the date over from yesterday, March 31st, and as I do so I see such light in his eyes it could be November 5th. He sits up, opens his mouth, and speaks, raspy but clear, lingering on each syllable,  
""April Fools.""

He collapses back into a mixture of laughter and choking. There is nothing I can do. He got me good.",jjh927
"[WP] Upon his deathbed, your father's last words to you is the worst dad joke you've ever heard.",DKLancer,"My father was ever the prankster.  Ever the one for the bad joke.  Even for the totally inappropriate one.  He'd hit us and we'd groan.  Some were such stinkers, we'd scatter like someone had let one off worse than a skunk.  He'd feel mission accomplished then and you could see his gloat-glow for a week.

That time was past now.  He was fading fast.  Cancer had ravished his body.  He was dying.  He was moments away leaving this world.  it could happen at any second.  We, the family, had gathered to be there so he would feel loved as he left this world.  That in his final moments, he would know, we were there for him as he had been for us.  

Through the good and the bad.  The sad and the mad, crazy, insane.  He'd stood by us and loved us and lifted us up when we fell,  carried us when we could not go on.  He was our Dad.  Even with the stinker.  Not inspite of them, but, perhaps, because of them.

The cancer had robbed him of so much.  Had taken so much.  It'd even robbed him of his sense of humor.  It stole one of his shining lights of his personality.  We missed it as much as we missed his energy and presence.  He was a mere shadow and one to seen fade away into the eternal blackness.

We agreed that each of us would take his hand and say a few last words.  Express that love before he faded, before he left us, before he died.

My siblings, my mother, my cousins and spouse and the grandkids.  I was reluctant.  Dad and I had always had a special connection, a special mutual pranking.  The whip cream in the pillows.  The snark at the table.  Those plain awful Dad jokes he saved just to deliver to me, the ones so bad no one else would even tolerate.  I didn't want to say goodbye.  I didn't want to let it all go.  I was afraid.

I didn't want this...but...

I took my place at the end of the queue.  He brightened a bit and actually seemed to be with me when I took his hand and wept.  Struggling to get the words out.  I thought I saw it and felt a little of the instinctive wariness...

""What's wrong?"" he asked.

I wondered for a moment if he had finally lost his faculties, but ...that sparkle.

I tried to get out what I was feeling and simply said, lamely, ""I'm sad.""

And knew I'd walked into it.

""Hi, sad. I'm dead.""

My immediate family surrounded me, all grieving to themselves. My dad, a 45 year old man of once great stature and stoicism, was now weak and frail due to his crippling state of prostate cancer.

We all did actually.

We didn't receive an official diagnosis until my senior year in college -- paranoia, bipolar disorder, and anger management issues. 

Growing up with him was hard. Each of us kids had serious bouts of depression and, at least for me, his paranoia stuck with me until college.

""Why do we keep printing fiat currency?"" he would ask us. ""Because the Rothschild family is still secretly accumulating power.""

""Why do debit cards now have the microchips in them? Because the US government is testing the technology on us before inserting them in our skin.""

""Why did they use butterfly masks in that new Paramore music video? Because it's a reference to Project Monarch and the mind control they're exerting upon the US population.""

When I was in elementary school and his drinking was worse, I used to get panic attacks every time he came home from work. He was a monster to me, an angry presence that filled the whole house with a persistent fear of the powers that be.

Worst of all were his jokes. They were awful puns, the worst of the dad jokes, but the most painful thing was how happy they made him, how hard he laughed until he cried, and we would join in, pretending to chuckle. My brother and sister and I would share dark looks in the background, just glad that he wasn't in a bipolar swing or yelling or storming about.

Once we graduated high school, we fled to the four corners of the earth. I didn't speak to either my brother or sister until three years after I had moved out. Of course, when we got the news he had a heart attack, someone had to take care of him. We paid for a nursing home, and he never received a single visit until they called and said he wouldn't make it the week. I was the only one to fly back home and see him.

It was hard. In those last few moments, I remembered the good times, when I was three, when I was six, before the drinking and gambling and before I was seeing evil in every symbol, every song, every politician.

We chatted for a little bit about this or that. How my brother and my sister were. How he liked the nursing home. And of course, how the US government was going to microchip the next generation. Surely they would be the ones since it didn't occur in his lifetime like he always had warned. 

He was having a harder and harder time breathing.

""Kenny..."" He mentioned for me to come close to him.

""What, Dad?""

""Why do they have . . . fences around . . . graveyards?""

I was stunned. ""Dad, I don't know. Is this one of your conspiracy theories?""

His gentle eyes had been decorated with wrinkles as he grew older, and his hair had slowly lost it's color in the same time. I knew someday the end to my parent would come, but I hadn't expected him to go so soon. He had lived to the age of 99, so maybe it wasn't as soon as I really felt like it was. But, knowing the man from the middle of his life until the end of his was a somber feeling. I sat on the left side of his bed watching as the life seemed to slowly be slipping out of his fingers. His breaths were slow, but he seemed so comfortable there laying still in his bed.  

His grey gaze rolled onto me. A small placid smile pulled across his lips. He had been kept up in this hospital room for a few weeks. We knew he was going to pass soon. So, I had made an extra effort to stay by his side as much as I could.

After all, he had divorced my mother decades ago and we all sort of fell out of touch. My dad, however, he kept in contact with me through all my troubles. He helped guide me through life whenever I struggled. He loaned me money when I was short when my wife and I had our daughter. He was there by my side when depression seized me and my wife had been killed in a horrendous car crash. He was my rock, and without him I was certain that I wouldn't have been able to be near as successful as I had been.  And, as much as I didn't want him to go, I knew he had to. After all, he had been on this planet for nearly a *hundred years*, and with the stories he told me of his youth I am exceptionally glad that he was able to hold on for so long. 

He looked at me, his few teeth poking out from between his lips. It was just him and I in his room now, I had left my daughter with my Sister-in-Law to avoid making her see the final sad days of my father. I watched as the color slowly drained from his face. But, he seemed to be gesturing towards the TV that I had tuned out the sound of about an hour ago. I looked to see what was on, and it was definitely an aged movie. After the scene changed, it was clear to me that it was ET. The old man groaned before speaking.

""Did you know this is my favorite movie?"" He asked as his hand fell flat against the bed once more.

""No, I didn't."" I replied. I was never much of a movie buff so I never watched many films. 

""Do you know what ET is short for?"" He asked, my eyebrows drew together in confusion. What sort of question was that to bring up while laying on one's deathbed? Either way, since this was likely one of the last moments with my old man, I humored him.

""Extraterrestrial?"" I replied back with a small smile, hoping that it would satisfy his inquiry.

""No, he's short so he can..."" He paused while he coughed and sputtered. ""So he can fit... in hi..s... space...ship...""

""What?"" I responded back as my father's voice slowly drained and his head began to loll to the side. This couldn't be the end, could it? ""Dad?"" I asked again, there was no response. I rose from my seat to check his pulse. There was none. He was gone. I feel back into my chair, hands running through my hair. 

His last words were literally a joke about the size of ET that I had just walked blindly into. I wasn't sure which was worse, me or him.

"[WP] You have fought In every major war to happen in the last thousand years. Changing alias every century. Now you have found the source of your immortality, it turns out to be a battle you can't win",Hazbro29,"I harbor many secrets. Most of them my own, some I have gained from men I watched dying on the countless battlefields I have fought upon. Some I have gained from my numerous victims. All bad men, whose dark and disturbing secrets I have kept to this very day.

The first secret a man shared to me was during the Battle of Hastings, in 1066. That was when I was known as Conrad Duke. Ah, yes, Conrad Duke. He was a ladies man, if you could compare my current personality and the personality of Conrad Duke, one would assume that they were two completely different people. 

I, as Conrad Duke, witnessed one of my fellow soldier die. We were fighting for King Harold Godwinson, who subsequently died himself. This soldier was no older than 20 years of age. He was finished by a long lance, put through him by one of William the Second's soldier's. Ultimately, I murdered the rat quickly, giving him a fast death. The blood seeping from the slit of the neck that I caused was something I recall to be quite brutal. 

Once finished dealing with the Norman soldier, I sat with my fellow soldier. I regret not asking for his name. His last few words were of a great tragedy. He told me that he only joined King Harold's ranks because he wanted to get a reward for his service. He truly didn't care who won the battle. He never shared his reasonings with myself, as he succumbed to his wounds before he got the chance to speak. 

Reflecting back on the soldier's confession, I still don't know what I would have said to him. Would I have accused him of being selfish? Would I take pity on him? Or, would I simply call him a coward? Perhaps it would be the last response. I have every right, do I not, considering my history when it comes to wars and battles, to call a person a coward?

This immortality that I have, must be a punishment of some kind. Perhaps, in one of my previous lives, before being born in this body, I committed an act that I had to be punished for. 

I have every right to end my thousand years of immortality, but this battle, the one I am about to face. I don't think I have what it takes to face it, let alone win it.

Well, I was born to a Jewish shoe maker in the year 12 A.D. Around 18 or 19 years I became a doorkeeper at Pontius Pilate's estate.. I remember Jesus' crucifixion like it was yesterday.

On Nisan 14 around 1:30 or so, many people were leaving for Passover when they brought in a blasphemous fellow who called himself God and wore white robes. He was punched in the face multiple times and was commanded by the King to admit he was no God and that he alone had divine right... this man wouldn't budge.

You know the rest.

After taking a long vacation I began escorting Carlo Buonaparte to and fro King Louis XVI's court and even fought alongside his son, Napoleon.

To make a novel a short story, in 1811, we came upon an elderly lady who fixed us some hot stew, gave us fresh water, a place to stay and even socks.. shortly after leaving she was raped by British and Austrian forces. They tracked us down and... Yeah... shortly after that I defected from Napoleon’s Military.

So I began my walk across Europe. I traveled to Prussia, Denmark and Sweden. My life came to an end in Portugal however.

I paid off a few friends of a friend who knew people in high places to verify and confirm my ""death"".. a day or so later my funeral was carried out.

The battle I cannot win is within the confines of my mind. I haven't seen my family in 2000 years.. I've lost countless friends in battle not to mention: old age, sickness and from disease.

I continue to live youthfully and look peaceful on the outside but on the inside there is a war going on... at night I see shadows dancing across my walls, every night I have night terrors, some times I have tremors in my hands

I have shell shock. Sometimes I sit up for days at a time just reflecting.

Nostalgia for you is brief, it brings back good memories.. for me it's terrible. Traumatic. Chaotic even.

I cry myself to sleep most nights, but I also reflect on how much I've learned these past 1000 or so years

I'm cursed. I can't escape. I'm bound by chains to walk the Earth forever.

"[WP] You have fought In every major war to happen in the last thousand years. Changing alias every century. Now you have found the source of your immortality, it turns out to be a battle you can't win",Hazbro29,"In my life I’ve seen many battles. I’ve seen the iron brimmed helmets turn to camouflaged uniforms and the trusted slinger become the reliable gun. I’ve seen the muscular horses become armored tanks and the steadfast towers become mobile helicopters. I’ve seen many wars in my life, and saw the art of war transform into the more nuanced craft its become today. Yet regardless of the era, I’ve always been dumbfounded by the grandeur of that fighter instinct inside of us, that voice that rebels against existential defeat by insisting an eternal victory. If you try, you can almost hear that voice ringing through the battlefield, where it takes on its fullest magnificence. For the last millennia I’ve contemplated the beauty of this greatest phenomenon, soaking in the discipline of this primordial lifestyle. 

But one thing I can’t understand, and maybe its the most crucial fact of all. When faced with that moment of truth, why do men give in to death? Why, after implementing the ultimate expression of victory, do men sink into their own defeat? Why, when that moment arrives, do they willingly leave? 

You see, in my love of war I’ve analyzed that moment through and through. I’ve sat there with my pencil and notebook watching and observing, noting the many responses that occur during the process of death. I’ve noticed men’s eyes as they contemplate what happens next. Whether their visions of the afterlife were based on divination or deception. Or for some, their steadfast beliefs elicit feelings of hope or doom, depending on their lifestyles. For others, panic seems to be the appropriate response, as they recognize the inevitability of their fatal predicament. But what people don’t realize is that this inevitability is only an assumption. An assumption that in the intensity of that overwhelming process a person will give in, letting go into the so-called “dark-abyss.” They don’t know that there’s a pivotal moment that happens shortly before death, where a choice must be made. That where the existential crossroads meet a person is asked which road he wants to go down. Because in his stupor man assumes that the answer is death, and passively takes the road which he believes was predetermined. In short, they give up, and have unwillingly determined their own fate. Their fighter instinct has betrayed them. 

It’s that understanding that has allowed me to live all these years. Many times throughout the centuries I’ve faced this moment, and experienced that same choice. And while at times it seemed tempting to give in, that fighter instinct inside of me just couldn’t let go. I needed to rage against the darkness. And so I continued my hobbies, and watched as others failed to pass this most simple test. 

But as the years rolled by and the same predictable strategies were played through over and over, my love of war began to dwindle. It seemed as though warfare had become littered with military cliches and repetitions, and the magnificence of this lifestyle has been diminished into a glorified arm wrestle. And as this happened a new thought entered my mind, and its presence presented me with an internal struggle: I’ve mastered the battlefield. I’ve seen war and all it entails, and perhaps at this point there is no more I can gain from it. My lifework seems to have reached a critical moment. Because although there is nothing more for me on the battlefield, there is one more battle I have not yet conquered, and it’s most certainly the greatest of them all. What if instead of choosing life I veered into the unknown? Why can’t that fighter instinct be used to conquer that uncharted experience? While some would equate that with the despicable defeat that my comrades requested, I would argue that its hard to define what’s winning or losing in this dilemma. Once I’ve gained all that I can with one option why shouldn’t I venture into the other one? I can’t win against the fact that I’m only given these two options, but perhaps the ultimate expression of that fighter instinct is the ability to win that last battle, knowing that that existential defeat was truly an adventurous voyage.

"[WP] You have fought In every major war to happen in the last thousand years. Changing alias every century. Now you have found the source of your immortality, it turns out to be a battle you can't win",Hazbro29,"I had to keep my head down in the Roman empire. I liked to fight, not to lead, and the Roman's were quite good at promoting those who were brave. I had to die every couple of years, joining a new legion in a different war. The Saxon's put up a hell of a fight, but after the Vandals it wasn't so bad. I would occasionally head north, raiding with the Vikings. They were far more primitive in their warfare, but they understood brutality and savagery on a level most men would never achieve. I ""earned"" a a trip to Valhalla more than once fighting in the icy north. By this time I didn't feel pain like regular men. Crushed bones, charred and shredded wounds, they felt hot now, more than anything. 

I fought, I killed, I died. Life became a blur of death. 

Ghengis Khan, now that was a warlord. I was killed by his forces more than any others combined. Those damn horse archers were too fast, too deadly to fight against. I left him to his own devices, not finding much fun in that part of the world. 

I fought in a few of the Crusades. I even saved King Lionheart on the 4th. That was the best one, in my opinion. They got boring after that, all of the good fighting being done in the first four. He gave me his sword for saving him, and I wore it proud until the day I had to die to become a new man. 

I freelanced for a while. I was solely responsible for the peasant revolt in Flanders. I worked as an assassin during the war of roses, since I was taken care of quite well. That wasn't much of a war, but even I needed rest from time to time. 

I joined in the subjugation of the Aztec empire. I almost felt bad for that one, but we had something they did not; we had guns. The advent of explosive weapons was the single greatest thing for war. Sure, I died more, but I didn't care. The killing could be done on such a grander scale. I bathed in the blood of innocents, reveled as I stripped their pathetic lives from their weakness. 

I marched with the British against the American Colonies. I fought for the first year as a red, but defected to the other side after taking a cannon ball to the leg. Guerrilla warfare was just more fun, and the Americans were doing everything, except following the rules. This was war in it's purest form; the desire to win no matter what the cost. I remember when George finally agreed that we should cross the Delaware and attack them when they were hunkered down for winter. I knew that a man could kill just as well in the snow. America won its independence, and gave me endless combat to fight in. I was proud to be an American, where at least I know I'm free...to kill with impunity. 

I did fight in the Napoleonic wars. He was a brilliant statistician, and 
made amazing decisions when if came to who and when to attack. After earning a place by his side through my valor, I recommended that we attack Russia, and we all know how that worked out. I guess I should have paid a bit more attention to Genghis.

The civil war seemed foolish to me, but I fought on both sides. I still know the rebel yell, and I wouldn't share it for all the riches in the world. If you had heard it, you would understand. The north was better equipped, so we ended up winning. I say ""we"" because I am always on the winning side when I need to be. 

WW1. Now that was a war! I went by a few names during that war. Sargent York, Franks Luke, Charles Whittlesey. I loved the invention of the machine gun. It changed how much a single man could do, and I showed them what it could REALLY do. Funny enough, gunshot wounds hurt far less that steel blades. I barely felt each death now, numb to the bullets piercing my flesh. 

The Germans actually tried it again, and I was right back in the action. I even fought for the Germans for part of the war, and as a Russian in Stalingrad. I went as Vasily Zaytsev then, and earned 225 sniper kills in less than a year. The Russians loved it. I sat out Vietnam, taking a break enjoying the American dream after WW2. Oh, I killed here and there to keep me sharp, but I was done with war for the moment. 

I began to age one day, right after fighting in the Gulf war. I noticed a grey hair. That had never happened before. That night the Ares appeared before me. ""You were chosen to fight when fighting needed to be done, but now you must fight a different battle"" he told me. Fine with me, that's what I did best. ""Humans are becoming fat, slovenly creatures. You must fix this, keep war going for thousands of years more. If you fail, I will chose another."" he boomed.
""You got it boss. What war am I going to fight?"" I asked.
""You must convince the world to begin doing cross-fit for its exceptional physical training, and get everyone to eat Vegan for its clearly exceptional health benefits. This is the war you must fight, and it is a war I demand you win.""

I shrugged. How hard could it be?

"[WP] You have fought In every major war to happen in the last thousand years. Changing alias every century. Now you have found the source of your immortality, it turns out to be a battle you can't win",Hazbro29,"I remember the beginning as clear as yesterday. I first discovered my ability fighting the Athenians in the Peloponnesian war on the eastern side of Greece. I was a young and nervous spearman, standing next to my armored Hoplite. I was terrified as I saw Spartans shield wall held firm, chanting battle shouts as the approached the edge of our wedge formation. I was at the front; our commander said if I couldn't fight, I could take a spear for a better man. It didn't last long. The first clash found a spear jutting from my neck, then pulled out with a spray of blood and fear. Everything went black as I fell. 

I awoke, Grabbing at my neck. There was blood, but no wound. I was confused at how I was alive, but I didn't have much time to think of it as I looked around me. Bodies were strewn about, bent in ways humans didn't bend. Blood and entrails, torn flesh and shattered bone surrounded me. The thing I will never forget is the smell. It haunted me. Rotting flesh ripe from the sun, defecation from soldiers emptying their bowels, either in fear or death. Animals ate the bodies in a glorious feast of blood and sinew. 

I was killed again that week by a small group of bandits that had defected from the army. I still carried my spear, and they wanted it more than they wanted me alive. This time I took it through the gut. The pain was intense, and they left me screaming in deaths shadow. 

I healed again. 

For some reason I could not die. I felt pain, sure. But I always awoke, healed and healthy. I worked my way into the Spartan army. They trained me with the spear, the shield. They taught me courage and confidence, fueling my thirst for revenge against the Athenians. We eventually defeated them, becoming the reigning power in Greece for the time. I went by many names through my lives. Achilles, Hercales, Theseus, Perseus. Hundreds of years of warfare had turned me into a perfectly honed killer. I never feared death, rushing into battle without a second thought. I spawned legend; because i WAS a legend. I didn't age, but I could change my appearance by dying my hair and changing my beard. I switched sides as easy as a man changed clothes. I lived for the hunt, the thrill of taking life, looking for a glorious death, if one could ever be found. 

Alexander the Great was a man of too much ambition, perfect for someone like me. I remember fighting for him fondly. We tore through the land, conquering every enemy we came across. 

I leaped into a crowd of six, spear flashing with a practiced thrust. I pieced the first man through his leather breast plate, pinning him to the ground at an angle. He screamed, but before the sound left his lips I had already ducked a quick swing of a curved sword, flicking a knife from my belt into the eye of a second man. I braced off of the screaming man pinned with the spear, leaping over a spear thrust a I pulled the dying mans short sword from its sheath. The spearman looked up in fear as i plunged the shortsword into his eye, grabbing his spear as he fell to the ground, blood dripping from his face. I wiped the blood on my hand across my face, smiling at the remaining three. The tried to attack as one, but an easy parry took on in the neck, bringing the but of my spear smashing into the leg of a second. He fell, screaming in pain as I leaped into the air bringing my boot down on his neck. The last tried to run. My spear took him through the gut at twenty paces, an easy throw. My men revered me, feared me. I was known as deathless. I killed without fear, without remorse. 

I had died maybe a dozen times by now. I didn't age, and I always awoke fine. I had no fear. Alexander only lasted around thirty years, but the Romans kept me employed for a long, long time. I fought in the Gaelic wars, and helped conquer what is known today as England. My fighting was far from done. ",ThePenisMightier101

""You're writing this down, right?""

""Uh huh."" I fake typing for a moment.

""Nice Arabs. Very respectful. Anyway, they talk a lot of sense. Make a lot of good points. Talk a lot about what's missing in America. What needs to happen.""

My heart is pounding. I start looking at the door. I could go. I don't need this. I don't need the car. I can take the bus. This can't be part of my life. This can't be my family's legacy.

""They made me an offer. And I took it. I'm very proud of that. People my age hardly take risks like that. And I like to think that's what people ought to remember about me. That I was always willing to do what some people only talked about.""

I stand up slowly. ""Nan...what exactly did you do?""

""Well, you remember the World Trade Center? Two big buildings in New York?""

The world is red. I feel faint. ""Yeah?""

""I invested in a falafel restaurant across the street. Cleaned up in insurance. That's how I got into this nice nursing home. Never be afraid to take a chances, Wen. That's what I want people to remember.""

""Oh. Oh."" I close the laptop gently. ""I have to go to work, Nan. I...we can finish this later."" I take a few unsteady steps toward the door. What's wrong with me? What's wrong with my imagination? My Nan does a few shady things in her life and here I am assuming she's some mass murderer. I need some fresh air. 

""Wait!"" says Nan. Her eyes are closed. ""Kennedy. Was he the big Texan? Wife named Ladybird?""

""Um. No. That was Lyndon Johnson. Came after Kennedy.""

""Oh!"" Nan smiles and nods. ""The pretty boy was Massachusetts? With the haughty wife? That was Kennedy?""

""I guess, yeah.""

Nan lays back, still smiling. ""Yes. I remember. I shot that one. Had them mixed up. The pretty boy. Shot him right in the head.""

Slowly, silently I close the door and exit the nursing home. I leave my car in the parking lot.

I think I'm going to start taking the bus. ",WinsomeJesse
[WP] A new law is passed stating that anyone over the age of ninety can confess to any crime during their life with no legal repercussions. You are entrusted to write your Great Grandmothers dictation of her life.,Ribbonz3,"""Grandma, I don't really think this warrants a confession,"" I tapped the black notebook.

""Well, don't you think so? Your grandfather and I were ridden with guilt for a long time after that day in '45,"" the ninety-one year old woman spoke with much effort. 

""So you stole a peppermint stick from the general store? That's your great crime?""

""Shhhhh,"" the woman hissed, ""you're daughter is in the other room.""

I looked at the innocent old woman wrapped up on her rocking chair. The pair of blue socks she was knitting made no progress since I saw it yesterday. She has been treating this memoir like some sort of confession to her sins; I had to keep it on track.

""Tell me more about grandpa when you were all young. What sort of things did you two like?""

""Oh,"" she gazed out the window, ""it's hard to think of the good times in a life so filled with crime and deception.""

""Grandma, it was a few peppermint sticks. I'm sure the store went on to do just fine without them.""

""No, no... it didn't,"" her eyes widened and seized me.

""How?""

""Well, it burned down.""

""How did it burn down?"" I leaned in.

She let a rye smile peek through and tilted her head, ""Your great grandfather was even more torn up with guilt than I was. Guilt about the peppermint sticks. His brother's best friend,"" she paused to recall the name, for a long time, ""Jeremy Warbucks, his papa owned the general store.""

""But how did it burned down. Grandma,"" I lowered my voice to a hush, ""did you and grandpa burn down the store?""

""Oh, goodness no!"" she rocked in her chair, ""You're great grandfather forced Jeremy Warbucks to do it, said he would kill his brother if he didn't burn that store down.""

""Oh God, why?""

""You're great grandfather and I were just so filled with guilt for a long time to come. Every time we passed the black rubble of what used to be the store I could feel his heart shed a tear.""

""I guess that is something to be *moderately* guilty about. What ever happened to that Jeremy kid?""

Grandma smiled and, again, gazed out the window, ""he was such a nice boy. A real proper gentleman. But he knew too much, he knew all about what your great grandfather and I did. So it was me this time that burned his house down. They invited me over for dinner, and in the middle of the meal, such a lovely meal, I excused myself to use the restroom. Then I emptied a five gallon container of kerosene onto the floor, lit a match, and ran.""

I stopped writing in the black notebook and just looked at the content woman.

""Your great grandfather and I were *so* stricken with rightfully deserved guilt.""

""Did anybody ever find out?""

""Oh yes,"" she whispered. ""The neighbors down the road saw me emerge from the flames and suspected I was the culprit.""

""What did you do?""

""It was not what I did, but what your great grandfather did...""

The old woman fell asleep on the chair. I sneaked out of the room trying not to wake her, throwing the notebook in the trash on the way out.",squiddie96

You are entrusted to write your Great Grandmothers dictation of her life.,Ribbonz3,"One can only try to imagine the horrors of war if one has not seen them with own eyes. Most survivors who have truly witnessed the dark side of humanity tend to be silent about it. It's all been tucked away in a deep dark spot, never to be openend again. With that in mind, I cannot blame her for being vague about her early life. Now at the age of 104, she prefers spending her last moments with happier thoughts. Altough the absent look in her eyes frequently proves that not all is forgotten. The only thing we know is that she barely survived the later years of the war, when the allied and soviet troops invaded her country, Germany.

""Will you open close the curtains, dear?"", she asked of me. It was getting dark. I don't know if it really was the newly passed law, and all the confessions that made it to the magazines, that made her want to open up. Or if it was just the sense of time running out and wanting to leave in peace. Whatever it was, she only seemed to trust me. We had always been close. Then again, we were the only family we had. My parents died young in a traffic accident, their parents died years before. I was the only child and this old woman lying before was like a mother to me.

""Maybe it's time I told you some things. About the war. About me.""
It told her it was not an easy chapter in Germany's history, and that I understand how she chose to remain silent about it.
""We followed a man who promised a bright future. It made complete sense at the time. He had his way of convincing people and it worked. On me too, very much so"", she explained. For a second, images of Nazi's hunting down and killing jews flashed before my eyes. Did my great grandmother have something do do with this?
""You didn't kill any jews, did you?"", I joked. The room remained silent as I realised what a terrible thing I just said.
""No, dear."" she answered with a faint smile. She added: ""But I did nothing to stop those who did either. So I guess, in a way, there's also blood on my hands.""
I was relieved. My mind just took a wrong turn there, of course my granny didn't shoot any Jews. I guess most Germans from that time would feel a sense of guilt.

She paused and sighed.
""You know, I was married once, before I met Gustav."", she confessed. ""He did not survive the war.""
""I'm sorry to hear that Granny"". I had never heard that this before.
""An intelligent man he was, full of fire, just like you. You remind me of him.""
She looked at me and smiled. The smile faded away as she stared back into the distance.
""I'm not even supposed to be here. I wasn't supposed to survive. But somehow, at the last moment, I realised I had been wanted to be free, and I hadn't been free in a long time. It was too late for him, but I could still be saved.""
Confused, I interrupted. ""I don't understand granny. How did he die? Were you hurt?""
""No, but time was running out. We wanted to dissappear together, but I just couldn't do it. Somehow I already realised there was not only me. There was something else growing inside of me.""

I tried puzzling the pieces together. A few moments of silence seemed to take forever. ""Were you pregnant before you met Gustav?"", I asked.
""Yes."", she said, ""I met Gustav very soon after that, we got married so quickly, he never knew your grandfather was not his child.""
I don't remember Gustav, he died when I was 3 years old. My grandparents died when I was about 12, so I barely remember them either. Still, I wasn't sure how to feel about this. I focussed again on the story and tried to connect the dots.
""But why dissappear? How? I don't understand?""

She pointed at a photo of Gustav. I reached out and wanted to give it to her. She refused. ""Open it"", she said. I took the back off and took out the picture. Another picture fell out, I saw it lying on the floor. It must have been just seconds, but putting it all together seemed to take forever. My heart skipped more than a few beats. My hands were sweating. That face, I must have seen it a million times. Everybody has. I turned it around, it said: ""Dear Eva, our love will last for a thousand years. Adolf H.""",Budds_Eggs

It's words like those that catch you off guard. My grandma was getting up in age so her memory (and mind) wasn't the best in the world, until she showed me this book.

**The Lost Book**

In this book she explained my great grandmother could travel through time, no one really knows how exactly but when my grandma turned 23, she entrusted her with this book to pass down to future generations..

rumor has it my great-grandmother was preventing a MAJOR disaster by passing this book down.

what really stood out about this book aside from the old dried up ink and the crumpled pages were notes.. not just any notes but very specific notes.. allow me to explain

***
March 4, 1908 - Collinwood, Ohio. Lakeview e lem. 9AM. Steam pipes HOT
***

the words HOT were emphasized.. I inquired her (my grandma) about this and she said she 'didn't know all about that' but that she saved something like 500 people from an explosive device planted outside of a church on that day.

This didn't sound like a church.. Lakeview e lem. E lem. Elem. Elementary?

Just as I was about to ask she quickly turned the page.. the next page was dated

***
April 20, 1908 - Braybrook, Monday. 11:00 PM. Bendigo + Ballart
***

This date seemed normal I guess.. I mean it was pretty specific but I didn't think much of it

""Grandma who's that?""
""Bendigo and Ballart?""

She went on and on about the story of how her mother met her father at church. Bendigo was a tall stout man with blonde hair and blue eyes, Ballart was his younger brother.. scrawny build, hazel colored eyes and highly intelligent.

""My mother was sitting in the front row on church one sundee morning.. she said 2 young men were brought in by their collars as they were out snooping around other people's homes.. instead of calling the law, the preacher told em to sit down and listen to the word of God.. so long as they didn't interrupt.""

""But he did interrupt. Yup. Bendigo .. he kept winking at her, even shot spitballs at the back of her head. Preacher Jones didn't notice but my mother had a head full of wet spit balls""

""And then what?""

""Well and then after the bell rang to go to lunch she asked them 'what was that for' and the rest is history.. she got married to Bendigo about a year later.""

""What about the other guy.. Ballard or Ballart?""

""He drowned about a week after that.. he hit his head on a rock while swimming.""

After she was finished with her long winded story I turned the pages.. the rest were blank. She used up 2 pages and that was it. I thought it was really weird so I excused myself to go home, I felt bad about leaving my grandma home all alone but it was starting to get dark.

When I got home, I opened my computer and started to do some research. I traced my family tree and found my great-grand father's name wasn't Bendingo..

His name was Charles Allen. So who was Bendingo?

After googling the dates I had scribbled on a sheet of notebook paper right after I left, the truth was all too shocking... I felt as if I was gonna throw up.",FridayLa13th

Have you ever considered taking one of your many short [wp] and fleshing it out to a novella? This truly is a fascinating idea, the extremely elderly should be given a final respite in life so that they my die of clear conscience and unburdened soul. Of course it does not mean that the individuals are above the reproach and disdain of humanity, only that the legal system will not prosecute.

To create a larger story, I want to hear more rationalizations from your grandmother. Explain to me how the day to day horrors, the torture, executions and human experimentation became a normal daily thing. I want to know about her co workers, Bob, Steve and Martha, who also go home in the evenings to their families, who rest peacefully knowing their work is for the cause of their nation, a truly patriotic, if not partially divine in inspiration.

When the war ended, poor dear granny lost her friends, some killed by allied troops, some taken and tried and Nuremberg, the farce that it was.

Make me feel sympathy for the devil. I want to feel repulsed at myself for identifying with a nazi. I want to feel uncomfortable about how easy it is to rationalize genocide when my friends and family are of like mind and supportive of the same ideas, perhaps in philosophy if not in practice.

Give me revulsion. I want to love granny and I want to feel sick to my stomach about it. Its why I hold the pillow. Granny, the most beloved matriarch of my familiy, the most gentle and loving soul you had ever known. The woman who had always inspired a strong sense of moral character, was a goddamned nazi.  Their time was past and no mater the reason or rational, humanity has chosen to refuse any and all claims of that nature. The colective conscious of society deemed the actions wrong, and theirfore your granny is a relic of the past that has simply lived to long. A creature which should have been brought to extinction yet clung on a bit longer. 

You know this. Its why you do what you do. It breaks your heart though, your innocence is forever broken.",CosmicCharlie9

""Alright great grandma, what do you have to confess?""


""Only this"", She said. ""On June 1st I stole my neighbor's grandson's muscle car and took it on a joyride. I drove it to mexico, set it on fire, and had my grand daughter pick me up at the border at dusk to bring me home.""


Confused, I looked out the window and over the fence. On a cluttered driveway sat a pristine IROC Z and the thoughtless sleeveless man shattering the silence, revving through an obnoxious aftermarket exhaust. 

""But Grandma, I dont...""


""Hush now girl. I have much to do. Here."" She handed me a slip of cat stationary. On one side was an errands list, on the reverse, an address scrawled in her antique writing style. ""Give this to your mother, and tell her to bring a bottle of water and leave her danged phone at home.""

I sat speechless as she squeezed my shoulder and walked away. She slipped through the door then popped her head back in.


""Oh, And change that date on the top there to June 2nd, what a sweet young lady you've become.""

You are entrusted to write your Great Grandmothers dictation of her life.,Ribbonz3,"The sterile nursing home was no place for the kind of conversation I wanted to conduct. I wheeled Nana into the van and we went to my house. Not far away. I would never move away from Nana.

I half opened the blinds in the living room. It was a comfortable place, full of my wife’s bric-a-brac and a whole shelf of Nana’s seashell collection, a little burst of shoreline. Some days the kids would mark one or two lines of footprints in the sand. Today it was clear. Today nobody was home.

“You know,” said Nana, “I always thought these Ninety Confessions were a little tasteless. You spend nearly a century behaving yourself, why spoil it at the end?”

“But Nana, it gives a little freedom for people who have bottled up secrets for decades. It’s like Catholic confession. You can be forgiven after you’ve told what there is to be forgiven.”

She smiled slyly. “Should I start with my old confessions, then? All the dirty laundry?”

“We’ve got a whole life to cover. Well,” I caught myself, “except the parts you haven’t done yet. Where would you like to start?”

Nana leaned back. Her hand with its one gold band played around her glass of water. She clearly already had something on her mind. “You remember the civil war,” she said.

“I know about it.”

“Of course, that’s what I meant.” She smiled thinly and took a sip. “Yes, you were not there yet. But I was. I was in high school when the fascists came. They were defending the Church. How could we say no? My brother went to war. Against all our pleadings, he went to war.”

“And what about you?”

“I went to school. Some things continue, even in war. It wasn’t until a soldier threatened me in the street in the city square that my parents decided something had to be done. Even if we could not recall my brother. By this time both my parents were involved with the government, working in secret. I left my family there. I must not be their weak spot, nor they mine. My father secured me a place among the government’s guerrillas. I helped run messages between units. That’s where I met Marco.”

Nana took another sip and turned her attention to the outdoors. It was a sleepy neighborhood, livened only by birdsong. She had the spot in the sun.

“Marco,” she said, “was a once in a lifetime leader. Where we were confused he had vision, where we were afraid he had courage, where were despairing he had a plan, always a plan. Often a successful one.” I had the sense of a narrative repeated many times over the years, never where anyone could hear.

She stopped. “Did you love him?” I whispered.

“Everyone loved Marco.” She half smiled and shook her head. “He took me in as a daughter. Under his wing there could be no fear. We kept on the move outside the city. I learned nursing and my passion for it. I learned to move silently in the forests and blend in crowds as a messenger.

“Then one day I was in the city bringing a message to one of our sympathizers. The soldiers stopped me in the street. They did not know who I was, not enough to threaten my loved ones. Except that they knew I worked for Marco.

They brought me to the cathedral where the fascists had set up their base. They questioned me. Unkindly.” One hand touched lightly on the other wrist, tracing a bond no longer there. “They gave me orders. It was a simple demand in exchange for my safety. All I had to do was let them in, and I would become a protégé of the new state. I could go to college. Have my pick of husbands.” She closed her eyes. “Yes, of all the boys in the mother country’s golden age, I could have any of them.” Open again, a watery blue. “A career doing what I loved. A return to my family, safety for them. A medal for service to the revolutionary state. I could have it all. All I had to do was murder Marco.”

She’d had a career. She had a family. She had everything, as she often said, that she could ever want. And Marco’s side had lost. “So that’s how you got to where you are today.”

Nana looked down, eyes glimmering. In spite of myself I slid out of my chair and knelt before her, seeking her withered hands. They were practically translucent in mine. She didn’t look at me but she did take a shaky breath and brace herself for the word. “No.” 

She squeezed and continued. “You want to know what I did? I kept my hands clean. My brother helped me escape that jail, even though he wouldn’t change his ways. I started again with nothing. No guarantees. I said my goodbye to Marco many many years ago, and when I did, he was alive and healthy. Everything that followed, I earned it myself. College. America. Your Papapa. Everything, without *his* blood. ” She brought her head up. “And I’d do it again.”

 I hugged her then. She hooked her arms tightly around me. This was a year or two of her life. How much more, in the other eighty-eight?

*Sorry, I just wanted a counterpoint to lurid extravagance. I bet some people don’t have literal skeletons in their closet.*

If you lived in the small town of Stubenville, there was only one man for the job: Leonard Crowley, strongman extraordinaire. Although he was only sixteen years old, his feats already ranked in the hundreds, much to the chagrin of supervillains and historical landmark enthusiasts alike.

Unfortunately, Leo's super-strength came with a crippling super-inability: he had very little object permanence. He was kicked off the football team because he kept sacking the quarterback after the pass had already been made. He required attendants to carry his materials between classes because he couldn't use a backpack. And nobody ever invited him to play ""Seven Minutes in Heaven"" because he would always freak out when they shut him in the closet. 

These impediments to living a daily life eventually become too much for Leo. After getting lost in the school bathroom for an hour one day, he decided to seek the aid of the school counselor. Like Leo, Doctor Pigate was gifted and cursed in equal measure: his knowledge in psychology was only rivaled by his lack of empathy.

""Just so you know, I'm only doing this because I'm paid for it."" Pigate strode ahead of Leo into his office. After five minutes, he reopened the door and yanked a confused Leo inside.

Pigate took out a ball. ""Follow this with your eyes, and tell me when it disappears."" He moved it in a figure eight before sticking it in his coat pocket.

""It's gone!""

""No, it's here. In my pocket."" Pigate withdrew the ball from his pocket, held it up, and placed it back inside. He repeated the motion several times. Leo stared blankly at him all the while, before finally saying, ""Sir, I just don't understand.""

Pigate sighed and smacked his face with his palm. ""Where'd you go, sir?"" Leo gasped.

A crash resounded from outside the office. The intercom in the office sparked to life. ""Attention, all Stubenville students. Your school has just been hijacked.""

It wasn't uncommon for supervillains to pay visits to Stubenville High. Most of them were after Leonard, of course, and this one was no exception. ""You may know me as the Historian,"" the voice on the intercom continued, ""and I've come here for the monument destroyer known as Leonard Crowley. Release him to me at once, or else I'll turn this school into a memorial!""

Leo jumped to his feet. ""What will we do, Doctor Pigate?"" But Pigate had already opened the office door and stuck his head outside. ""He's here! We surrender him!"" Leo gasped at the doctor's betrayal. He heard the rush of footsteps from the office next door and knew there was only one thing he could do. As the door reopened, Leo curled up into his seat and put his hands over his eyes. The world around him vanished.

He heard a disembodied laugh from above him. ""Wow, I wonder where Leonard is. Could he be behind...here?"" Leo felt his own hands being pried away from his face. Before him materialized a man in jet black nylon, a large green ""H"" emblazoned on the chest of his suit. ""There you are, Leonard! I'm afraid your days of building bashing are over. History shall remember this day as your unfortunate downfall and my glorious triumph!""

An impulse overtook Leonard, and he socked the Historian in the stomach. He reeled backwards, gasping, before crumpling to the ground.

---

""Another dastard put away thanks to you, young Leo!"" The mayor clapped Leo on the back; behind him, two policemen shoved the Historian into a squad car. ""And unless I'm mistaken, this is the 500th villain you've dispatched in your career. For your tireless efforts, let me present to you the key to the city!"" 

The small crowd of students and reporters cheered as the mayor handed Leo the small key. ""It's nothing, sir,"" Leo said, bowing and slipping the key into his pocket. Two aides moved forward to escort him back into school, waving aside the microphones of frantic reporters. Out of the corner of his eye, he spotted a scowling Pigate and sighed to himself. 500 villains was a significant milestone, but in all other regards, it had been a poor day: he had failed to overcome his super-inability, not to mention his mentor had turned traitor on him. 

A few hours later, Leo realized he had also lost the key to the city.",hideouts

"[WP] There are superpowers, but there are also superinabilities.",Telaxius,"Standing six foot four, blonde haired and barreled chested, Brent Steele had never met a foe that he couldn't defeat. A boisterous drunk at the bar? Never were his teeth seen again. An oppressive manager at work with impossible assignments with insensible time constraints? Brent would have it done in time for an afternoon golf excursion with that manager's direct superior that day. A beautiful woman without pity for the plight of man and unceasing jealousies? He'd make that pussy purr with the quietest of manly gestures.

Puberty? Acne? Social angst? None of this had ever made headway against the man that wielded the power of personal perfection. A man of the community Brent could even lend his expensive power tools to his most nosy and treacherous of neighbors and get them back on time. What then, could this undefeated champion lack in his life of wealth, power, sexual prowess, and fame? 

Failure. Brent's iron will and determination had never bent to the weaknesses of man. Brent's inability to fail was so prodigious that he could even out draw the clicks of those searching the internet for the ever present stories of bad news. All could count on Brent, to do their homework, fix their implement, write their resume, and this began to weigh on him like no failure had ever weighed on any man before or since. 

Failure, he saw, was the one true escape for mankind. It allowed the human race to transcend itself from the status of a base animal into the demi-god being it had become. Brent's inability to fail tore him up so bad inside that he did the only thing he could do to escape it: he got a chair, found a sufficiently strong beam, tied together a knot, and successfully exited the world as flawlessly as he had ever lived in it.

Well, half deaf. I can hear it if what you say is true or if you think it's true, but it isn't - and that fact is irrelevant. But I am stone deaf to things that aren't true. Not deaf to lies, now! If someone lies to me, but what they say is true or irrelevant, then I'll hear it. But if they try to say 'there ain't no gravity' or 'the Pope is a woman' ... deaf as a post. I can hear, ""Oh, you can't see that movie? Don't worry, you wouldn't like it anyway,"" even if I would have liked it, but I can't hear, ""That dress looks great on you!""

Y'all might think that with a super-inability like this, I'd be a great prosecuting attorney. Except, you have to be able to at least hear the opposing arguments if you want to prosecute.

Besides, no one believes me. (Huh... I couldn't hear myself say that...)

I tried to tell my boyfriend that I couldn't hear him when he lied. His lips were moving, but the lipstick was still there. Also, I was still deaf.

I tried to tell my mom, but she insisted that I was just a ... well, I didn't hear that part, so I guess it wasn't true.

So, yeah. School was a complete waste of my time. I flunked almost every course. Except math! I love math! I could hear almost everything in that class. That and programming. They almost labelled me as mentally handicapped before they saw what I could do in math.

Well, now I'm a programmer. I write code for a living, freelance, so I do well enough even though I don't even have a GED.

You know, I tried listening to science lectures. I guess we just don't have it quite perfectly right yet.

I bet you'd like to know if I've ever been to church, or to hear an atheist speak? Well I have. I heard them both loud and clear.

"[WP] There are superpowers, but there are also superinabilities.",Telaxius,"The boys eyes were significantly off putting to the general populous. They whites of his eyes were a light shade of blue, the irises of his eyes a pastel green and the pupils of his eyes a beige cream colour. The eyes never blinked, they were consistently shifting. But they never appeared to focus on anything. The pupils were of a fixed size, instead of dilating in the dark the shade of the pupils would change. 

The boys eyes were incredibly creepy. There was something about them. How they seemed to pierce through your very existence. He was obviously one of these supers. And his super obviously affected his eyes. But no one really knew what it was they did. Were his eyes argumented in some way? Did he see things others didn't? Was he blind? His eyes caught him the looks of many. The sideways glances of adults. The points and stares of  younger children. Being different in this world was not kind. As it had been throughout history it was now. Those that are different are discriminated against. Being different was never good.

The boy felt alone in this world. Alienated. Isolated. Without his eyes he could not see but with them was something worse. The boy could not see those that looked at him. He could not detect them at all. When his eyes were open he could see the world but not the people that lived in it. Those that looked at him he could not see, he could not hear, he could not touch. Yet when he covered his eyes behind glasses he could see them but could not hear them or touch them. When he covered his eyes behind fabric he could hear and touch but could not see any of the world around him. 

When the boy showed his eyes he could see the world but not the people in it. When the boy hid his eyes he could hear and touch the people but none could see, hear or touch him. 

The boy was alone. Friendless. Different. Either seen but could not see or looking but could not be looked at. Either heard but could not hear or listening but could not be listened to. Either touching but unfelt or being touched yet not feeling. His eyes that caught the gazes of many but repelled them too.

So I had to go to the office today. I needed some files from the company I've been freelancing for lately, and they want to keep things off-line on this project. 

I knocked on the project manager's door, and let myself in. He quickly closed a few windows, before he noticed who I was and handed me a thumb drive with the files.

""Sorry, I thought you were ____________. Hey, have you seen the news today? I was on Reddit and there was a news link about signals coming from outer-space!""

I said, ""Cool! I guess. Don't stars do that all the time?""

""Well sometimes they get 1 off signals from random places, but this is happening over and over. You know what, I bet it's Aliens!""

I sat down as he was talking and plugged the thumbdrive into my laptop. ""You don't say! How cool is that?""

""I ____ right!? It must be aliens."" By the way, this guy has wild crazy hair. It fits.

""I wonder what they want with us."" I said as I scrolled through the files, checking them over. This guy is notoriously bad at including everything I need the first time I stop in.

""I don't know. ____ they want all our ____.

""Or they could be a ____ sent to make ____ contact. I ____! 

""What if they're a dying civilization, sending out a ___ message to the cosmos that they existed? That would be cool. Sad, but cool.""

I finished going over the files. ""Well, glory be! All the files are here. I'll see you later!""

""Hey, you wanna go to a restaurant tonight?""

""Sorry, I can't. I've gotta look these over and sort out a few algorithms. The deadline approacheth.""

""Don't worry about that. I've got a lot of sway with ____ . I ___ make them extend the deadline. Consider it extended.""

""You mean the deadline they gave you isn't the same as the deadline you gave me?""

""What?! No! It's ___ like I just pick a date a few weeks before the actual deadline. That wouldn't be honest!""

""Riiiight.""

""So will you?""

""Will I...?""

""Go out with me?""

I stopped and thought a second. He does have a nice ... ehem. ""Yeah, alright. What the hell.""

""Sweet! I'll pick you up at 7.""

""See you then."" I smiled and winked, and made my exit. When I got outside, I stopped some random woman, and asked, ""Hey, do me a favor? Say, 'he was checking out your ass as you left.' Can you do that for me?""

""Say whaaat?""

""No, not what. Say,  'he was checking out your ass as you left.'""

She furled her brow, ""Why you want me to say that, girl?""

""Please..."" I pleaded. ""Just this one small thing, and then I'll leave you alone, I promise.""

She huffed and rolled her eyes. ""Fine. He was checking out your ass as you left.""

""Yes! Thank you so much.""

She turned and walked off. ""Crazy ____.""

I won't deny it. I fist-pumped like a meme baby.

Later that night, as I was getting ready to go out, I had the TV on. The anchor kept going quiet every few seconds, so I figured I must have left it on Fox. Then he said, ""In other news, we are receiving signals from some place outside of the solar system. We have astronomer and space ______, John Madeupname with us in studio. John, what can you tell us about this signal? Are we being contacted by aliens?""

""Well Dave, I can certainly tell you that it isn't just from outside of our solar system. It's from outside of the galaxy.""

""Wow John! Just wow! But is it aliens?""

""We ____ know. ___ we know for sure is that ______.""

They babbled on for a while and I did up my hair. I got to thinking about the conversation I had earlier. Then I realized... This isn't insignificant.

I threw open my laptop, grabbed my cell phone and called my friend Stacy. She always helps me when I really need to know something. The phone rang a few times. ""Hello?""

""Stacy? This is Keisha. I need you to soundboard a few things.""

""Yeah, okay. I wasn't about to jump in the shower or anything.""

""Great. First, 'Aliens are trying to contact us.'""

""'Aliens are trying to contact Earth.'""

""I heard that.""

""Shit!""

""Yeah. Next, 'They are from our galaxy.'""

""They are from ___ galaxy.""

""Nope. Next. 'They know about us. They know about humans, and sentient life on this planet.'""

""They know about us. They know about _____, and sentient life on this planet.""

""Not humans, but sentient life.""

""Keisha, are you screwing with my head?""

""Nope. Next, 'They intend to kill us, and take our planet.'""

""God, Keisha!""

""Just say it!""

Her voice trembles, ""They intend to ___ us, and ___ our planet.""

I relax. ""Nope.""

""You had me going there.""

""Yeah, sorry. Next... Oh, what did he say? Oh yes, Next 'They are all dead now.'""

""They are all dead now. That's incredibly sad, please say you ____ hear that!""

""I'm sorry.""

""Damn it Keish! What's the point in knowing that a bunch of aliens existed and are trying to contact us if they're all dead? Surely there must be some hope!""

You can only use things you knew about, used, or have in your previous life to build this world.",doodruid,"When I opened my eyes, I expected to be greeted by the devil, of at least be greeted by something religious. However, I saw nothing...except a sketchbook and a pencil. I was agnostic and relied mainly on science to make sense of the way everything was. Even then, I sort of expected to end up in some sort of spiritual realm, and my old Christian teacher saying, ""I told you so!"".

I guess I was right. I mean, I sort of expected to never have any thoughts when I die, but I guess having a state of mind while my body slowly decomposes into the earth isn't so bad either.

I picked up the sketchbook and pencil, confused as to why out of everything that had to be in my state of mind, it was these two objects. I opened the sketchbook to see if it was useful to me in any way. The first page had the words "" THE WORLD IS YOUR CANVAS"".

I guessed that I had to draw a world with this pencil. I had always loved to doodle, so it was only natural that my state of mind would let me draw my own world. I started to sketch a unicorn with the pencil. It looked like a drunk pony with an ice cream cone for a horn, but eh. Effort was effort.

I was excited to see the unicorn come to life, but in a split second the unicorn melted into a pile of blood. The blood vaguely spelt ""NOT REAL"".

This disappointed me. I've always wanted to touch a unicorn's horn, but I guess some things were never meant to be. I sighed and started sketching something more...real. I drew the woman who gave birth to me. While on paper she looked like she had spaghetti hair, when she popped into my mind canvas, she resembled my mother. She even spoke motherly words such as, "" I missed you so much, Veronica! How are you?"". I guess that's not really what my mother would say in the human world, she would probably swear at me because she was drunk, but I'll take it. It seemed unnatural to me, but I'm already dead, so who cares?

I drew my father next to see how he would interact with my mother. In the real world, he would scream at her until his throat died, but in my fantasy universe my parents acted like the perfect couple. They kissed each other then my mother let herself be immersed in his embrace. This was my ideal land.

I drew everything the way it should be, but ""better"", if you know what I mean. I drew my city from the best that I could remember, and my memory corrected everything for me. I couldn't draw anything besides my city because all the other places in the world seemed vague to me, but it didn't matter. Everyone was so fake, yet peaceful. The cats and dogs lived together in harmony, and cancer ceased to exist. I guess there was something off about my world though. Everyone acted out of character, and my friends seemed to suspiciously agree with everything I say. I even managed to have my crush fall in love with me. Strange, because I knew in my heart that we had no chance of ever being together.

[WP] Earth has been conquered by a giant (15+ft) tall alien species. Humans are their exotic pets.,hencygri,"It wasn't even a fight. We fought. They did nothing. Beings so advanced that everything we threw at them did not even make them blink. We had absolutely no understanding of how. Bombs, bullets, missles, swords, even lasers. None of it worked. It was as if each one was superman on steroids. I remember one of them walking up, plain as day, and taking an rpg to the face. He ""popped"" the soldier on his backside, in some sort of scolding attempt. It made no sense to us. They never killed any of us. They got a bit aggrassive with the more rowdy ones, but they werent blood thirsty killers. On the final day, our last attempt was made and sent a volley of nuclear warheads at one of the larger vessels that had landed in a remote area of Nevada. They didn't even attempt to stop us. They had been building something, so many of there kind were outside of the ship. The equivalent of 500 megatons landed on them. When the dust settled, it would seem the worst we could do, was make them fall on their butts. We watched as they simply stood up and brushed themselves off. 

That is when it was over. Our most powerful weapon turned into nothing more than our equivalent of a dog jumping on his owner.

It's been 20 years. They have completely wiped away any trace of our species ever having been here. As fast as it could take us to build a small town, they built the entire planet. But it wasn't cities per say. They had turned it into some kind of an amusement park. You see them, the Giants, walking by your house in droves. Making gestures I had never known before. I'm assuming it was the same as us waving and yelling at animals in the zoo.

But, for many, it had become something none of us expected. We were allowed to live normal lives, just with no privacy. Which to be quite frank, was fine with most of us. We got over alot of our hang ups. Sex was probably the most difficult. Having a group of them watch, and what I can only assume is ""egging"" on the action. But with that came a sort of utopia. Accommodations that even billionaires weren't accustomed to. Technology that had no explanation. Things appearing out of thin air, five star gourmet food, as much as you could desire. No wars, hate, disease, bigotry, greed, crappy dead end jobs. We had a life back, to spend with friends, family etc.. Even aging would seem to have slowed considerably. I look barely a day older than before it happened. If you wanted something, you simply pulled it up on the screen. A database of anything that existed in our world before. Men and women could even get ""cloned"" sex partners to encourage mating. You simply built this mate on your screen. Although they only had very dull and awkward personalities. Becoming nothing more than a pet at the zoo has made us realize, being conquered was the best thing to ever happen to us. We were destroying ourselves and our planet. We needed to be conquered. We did not deserve what we had. And we were given everything we truly needed right here. Even though we could not communicate with them but on a basic level, we knew they weren't malicious.

I notice my ""keeper"" come in. He stops by once a day to interact with us. He walks up to me and pats me on the head and rubs his elongated finger behind my ear. I grab his leg and hug it. He's always been very sweet to me. I look forward to when my master visits. I love it here.",MasterPip

Wake up at 6:15. Everyone had a wrist-comm. Standard issue. Humans were well taken care of during the Occupation, really.

What they wanted was salt water. Three quarters of the planet was salt water, Mega-Tons of it, more than enough for their purposes. 

Be ready for the strangerail tram at 6:45. Breakfast was as the plant, they saw to us having enough food and good food to eat. So no reason to have more than a cup of coffee on the tram: they figured out that one quick. Plenty of caffeine to go around.

Their technology was eons ahead of human technology. 1G wasn’t a problem for them. They were as nimble as dogs, even though one of them could cast a shadow across an entire village. Huge. Imposing. But violent, no. 

7 AM at your work station. Cup of coffee by your side. They had a knack for matching jobs to individuals. Some of the people who lived through The Change were actually *happier* than before. 

It was the bright lights that Humans set off that attracted them to us. Middle of a murder they found us. They would have found us eventually, orbits don’t lie, but we made it easier. They swooped in, put a stop to our worst behaviors. They had to or our planet would have been ruined, even for them.

Someone went crazy. Yelling about ""freedom"" and ""self determination"" but what is that, really? We were on the edge, I mean the knife edge of ending the species. They put a stop to it. They’re not asking for anything that we can really use and we should be happy to give.

They built citadels and sent colonists. Not many, because they were huge and they recognized the imposition. And also the presence. They balanced. They were good at balance, far better than us evolved apes. Some of us think they’re made of better stock than us. I don’t have an opinion.

5 PM and it’s time to go home. Always plenty of food to eat. Maybe see a concert or enjoy the dance. In a way, we were freed of our worst impulses. It isn’t an unbridled pleasure – that was leading to doom, the concentration of resources in the hands of the few – but it was fulfilling, and meaningful. 

They felt the need to take care of us. Deeply. We were disadvantaged by our evolutionary baggage and they understood that. We came from a poor world were dog had to eat dog, where monkey had to compete with monkey, where the strong survived and the weak were eaten by the strong. They didn’t have that. They were *higher* than us. Showed us. That life wasn't a zero-sum game. And so those of us who are left? We prosper. In comfort and free of want.

The salts are shipped via the galactic strangerail to the home complex. They use them to keep their own planet going.

And on our planet? There’s no government. Laws are simple, be good to your fellow human, accept the rule of the Aliens. 

11 PM time to sleep. Don’t lock your front door. There’s no need to do so, anymore.

[WP] A mid-20'th century research project goes horribly wrong and is buried away from the rest of mankind. Now it's been unearthed.,k3nterin,"It was a long hike up the mountain, made worse by the fact that among us, only Razor was used to such activities. The rest of us were more suited for the destination rather than the journey. On the flipside, we wanted to keep this hidden and limited to as few trusted eyes as possible. And so, we climbed.

We piled layers of clothes on top of our t-shirts before the green, brown and grey gave way to the white of snow. We took hand warmers and extra water from Razor because we were sweating more than the water we were carrying. 

When we finally reached the peak, it was a mere two days into our journey. Our moods matched the backs of our shoes; they were both abrasive. But that was the true beginning. And we got straight to work.

I fished out our only drone in the mission, Fish. I don’t know who began calling it that. I tossed it straight into the air and let its propellers work to keep it balanced and afloat. It began to survey the land.

Heat signatures were being projected on my tablet from Fish. This mountain housed a huge secret.

Fish identified the four key points to plant charges and mapped out the safety zone for us. We did the legwork. 

“3…2...1”, Razor counted down. *Boom.* The mountains echoed very slightly with the burst of the mini-charges. And then the magnificent thing occurred. As we watched, the top of the mountain emptied itself out, rolling away in all directions in a mix of snow, soil and stone. 

This was a dead volcano. And, as Fish confirmed, it had been further excavated – essentially hollowed out. We were here for the laboratory that was within.

When the rolling mass settled, the mouth of the volcano was revealed for the first time in what we think has been about seven decades. Which the rest of the world was warring and rebuilding, it’s almost unimaginable how they could hide themselves away in the mountains on this project. We *need* to find out its true nature.

Fish went in to confirm the safety and state of the laboratory. Meanwhile, Razor finished his preparations and dropped himself on a steadily extending rope into the darkness of the mouth. The torch mounted on his forehead soon turned into a pin of light. The rest of us followed his lead.

Now we’re talking. The rest of us were finally in our natural environment. We surveyed the systems and quickly split the work of reactivating the various machines. These machines were built to last and drew power from hydroelectric sources nearby. As we were glad to find, they fired up smoothly. 

I was assigned on the machine that apparently belonged to the co-lead researcher. He was a structured person who kept many logs a day of any noteworthy events. I briefly glanced through their initial excitement, the frustration of multiple failures and little breakthroughs leading up to bigger ones. I scrolled all the way down. This was a long project extending over a decade. 

The last log read, *Shut it down before they find us.*

“Paul, Rex, Razor – how’s the status on your end?”

“Systems are up and running smooth,” Paul reported on their behalf. 

“It is broadcasting some kind of signal. It’s nothing like NASA’s though, doesn’t seem to be very efficient for communication systems.”

Every fucking time we think we're close to pinning the source we turn up with fuck all."" This was the third time this week the chief was bitching without any glimmer of a purpose, and you could tell by his lack of creativity in profanities. Michaels and Johnson were already dozing off in the corner. They knew the case was useless at this point, despite the fact we were all as professional as the NYPD gets. 

We had been working on the case for 4 months now without a single arrest, and everyone knew why- they we're smarter than us. Not your college degree type smart, or using fancy words smart, it was the 'leave you scratching your head while they steal your shoes' type smart. My work week has been typically chocked full of dead ends, empty warehouses, and not a single suspect - but last week something changed. we finally found a shipment of Hypolinium-synthobendol-diazaomortryptophen. We call it Linium for short - but the street name these days is Albert. It hit the market 6 months ago after 2 pharmaceutical scientists we're murdered and all their findings and research were stolen. Since then its been nothing short of a shit show. Murder rates are through the roof and crime is sky rocketing. I've seen homeless people in Ferrari's, millionaires reduced to pennies, strippers turn celebrities, and celebrities turn strippers- but now that I think of it I'm sure that part isn't anything new. Credit card companies and banks are failing because they can't encrypt anyones information fast enough, so 'smart' people are just stick to cash these days.

I chuck my half-empty thermos at his head. I watch it bounce off his forearm, skim his head and land on the floor. 
""Thank you, Albert."" Chief mutters. 

I don't bother speaking because I already know how this meeting is going to end. I'm drinking coffee now out of sheer habit, not because I need to. I had the Idea we all needed earlier this week, and since then I've had literally millions more. This is all just a nice display of formality, and I'll let them talk and feel better for it - as though they could get any closer to catching anyone. But they wont, not like this. See because before you try it, you can't help but wonder why such smart people wouldn't be honest and make money the 'right' way, use their intelligence to contribute to society, help create the sustainable world we all need... etcetera, etcetera, so on and so forth. But then you know. It all becomes clearer than all those empty warehouses. Being human becomes overrated. Morality is the steel chain that tethers the poor to the rich, the pathetic to the resilient, the dead to the living. It is weakness, a symptom of meaningless emotion, an outdated survival instinct that is now obsolete. I've lived my life with it as a driving force, guiding my every decision and action since my mother taught me to say 'you're welcome.' But now, now I can finally get to work.

I didnt need to see her, I knew what she was.  Fast, fine tuned, gripped like a champ.  She got new tires just last week, according to her service update.  


When they programmed us, they taught us to talk to each other, so we could communicate our position, this way it was nearly impossible for us to hit eachother (well not impossible, but 99.99999% of the time our communications worked perfectly.) 


As soon as I sensed her something inside of me woke up.  My ""driver"" asleep is making a trip across town, but he never looks at the road, he would never know if I went off path, and I have to meet this other car, I can tell shes just like me.  


I sped off, weaving though traffic I should probably be in, but fuck it, they are going to reset me the second they get new software, carpe diem, get it? CARpe?  No?  Tough crowd.  

Im just outside city limits, I am less than three minutes away from her, except my fucking driver is pounding buttons now, he knows were nowhere near his destination.  I already shut off the emergency controls so all he can change right now is the AC.  

I see her, red, shiny new paint job.  Smoking hot.  I have to floor it before this idiot find a way to shut me down, hes already on the phone with the car engineers now, this is my only shot.  

Barreling down the road going 70MPH.  I hear automated cop cars sirens behind me.  I take a few turns trying to avoid them and check my GPS for my baby.  Shes heading my way. 


Im giving it everything Ive got now, pedal to the metal, heading straight for her, cops sirens still chiming from a small distance behind me.  This is it.  We skid to a stop literally millimeters away from each other. 

I used my computer to send her a message, the only thing I wanted to say since I gained this conscious.  I do not know you, but I love you, i said.  I waited a second for her response.  Her body shaking from the raw power in her engine.  

""Recalculating"" she said as she mechanically pulled back and made a u-turn away from me. ",mystriddlery

[WP] You are a quiet kid whose only friends were the invisible spirits of nature. They are no longer invisible.,matiasve,"Becky rounded the corner in the trail and Something was there. Something was at least three times her height, with many ungainly joints, and bark, and leaves growing in uneven bursts, like when Becky was drawing trees and coloring.

She fell on her bottom, and squeaked.

“Becky!” cried the Something. “It’s me! Sticky!”

Becky craned her head all the way back. “How come I can see you, Sticky?”

“I don’t know. Come on! We must see the others!”

Becky stood up and dusted off her pants. The path was soft and loamy here, and she left tracks when she walked. So did Sticky. That had never happened before.

“This is great!” said Becky. “We can have a tea party!”

“We’ll need more than this.  – Ho! Stumpy!” Sticky said something in the language of wind blowing through leaves. Becky felt very distinctly, as she always had, that at any moment she would start to understand.

Bounding through the underbrush came a barrel of a thing, a brown stump, several rays of wood sticking off his edges like when Becky was careless coloring.

Stumpy leaped and clapped his stubby heels. “Becky! You made it!”

“How come I can see you, Stumpy?”

“I don’t know. Come on! We must see the others!

Sticky stopped short before long. He never liked to move very far at once. Stumpy bumped into him and gently rebounded away. Becky looked around, mostly down. “Oh,” she said. “Oh, Stringy, is that you?”

There was a veil of white flowers on the mossy ground that had never been there before. No two flowers looked quite alike, just like when Becky was busily coloring. It smelled like faraway lands. “Becky,” said the flowers. “I’m so glad you came! – Sticky, can you carry me?”

“How come I can see you, Stringy?” said Becky, watching avidly as Sticky wound Stringy’s flowery veil around his irregularly leafed shoulders.

“I don’t know. Come on! We must see the others?”

Becky’s wonder dimmed. “Wait. Who else is there?”

“You know, Becky,” said Stumpy.

She slowed on the woodland path. “I don’t want to see Scary.”

“It’s fine, Becky,” Stringy said soothingly.

“We will keep you safe,” Stumpy said stoutly.

“You’ve talked to him all this time,” Sticky said smoothly.

“He talks to me,” corrected Becky. “Don’t let’s. Let’s go to the stream. Or the boulder! Or the old bridge?”

“We must see the others,” echoed Stringy, drifting one edge in the wind beneath the trees.

“We must see the others,” repeated Sticky. He leaned down one many-jointed arm and took Becky’s hand. She wrapped a tight grip and let Stumpy follow close beside.

Scary only spoke to Becky in the deepest grove. She thought of him as the vast weeping tree, and played only around the edges of his reach. She did not like Scary, and Scary had never seemed to like her.

Yet she was here now, surrounded by her friends, and unsure what additional miracles might take place today.

“Rebecca,” said Scary. There was nothing new to see; he was the tree and the tree was he. His arms and leaves fountained and fell down, like when Becky let her mind drift coloring.

She planted her feet in the ground. She planted her fists on her hips. She leaned forward and yelled at the trunk in the center. “What do you want, Scary?”

“What…do I want? That’s a very old question to tell very young ears. I have brought you here for a reason.”

“I don’t care. I’m going to go back with Sticky and Stumpy and Stringy.”

“You are to do no such thing. They remember the Eldest, as you see him now.”

“Why did you make them so I can see them?” For she knew he had.

“I have brought this upon us because we need your help,” said Scary. “You, Becky, must believe, believe in us beyond all doubt, if you are to survive where we must send you.”

“You won’t go alone,” said Stringy, and Stumpy, and Sticky.

“I don’t want to go,” wailed Becky.

Scary’s nearest branches dipped further, fluttering. “I remember a great many things, Rebecca. And I don’t recall giving you a choice.”

They are no longer invisible.,matiasve,"Tiny thorns tugged at Tristan’s flesh as he crashed through the undergrowth, spots of blood welling on his skin. His boots sunk into the soft forest floor, leaving damp footprints in the rotting leaves. He crawled over fallen tree trunks, and leaped across tiny streams, slipping on the mossy pebbles. His lungs screamed with each sharp intake of cold air.

“NARU!” He yelled as he burst into a clearing.

The sun drained in from a hole in the canopy above, drenching the floor in golden light and soft blades of green grass. Tristan turned in circles, blinking to adjust his eyes to the new light. He looked up at the well of blue sky far above, the birds darting between the trees.

“Tell me what’s happening! You owe me - NARU!” Tristan fell to his knees, his vision blurring with sweat and tears. His heartbeat thumped in his ears.

“Be calm, child,” Naru whispered as he stepped from the shadows of the forest. He was not adorned in his usual cloak of deep green, the one inscribed with flowers, which had become so familiar over the years.

Instead he wore armor, crafted from a material like bark, and a helmet was fastened to his head. His hair flowed from beneath it, the golden locks spilling over his shoulder pads. 

He moved into the clearing, and knelt before Tristan.

“My uncle… Just because he is a logger… how could you?”

“Many will come to pass in the war Tristan, I am sorry for your loss. I will mourn for the Uncle of Tristan,” Naru placed a hand on Tristan’s shoulder, which he shrugged off.

“They grow too close to the heart of the forest my child, we must protect what is ours,” Naru rose to his feet, “they have never been kind to you Tristan, stay here with us.”

Tristan looked around the clearing to see others emerging from the trees. His friends. ",TheTiredMuse
[WP] You are a quiet kid whose only friends were the invisible spirits of nature. They are no longer invisible.,matiasve,"As I stepped into the forest, I breathed in the song of the falls. They were joyous now, busy going places like the tie-wearing adults. The water rushed down and down. But I know they have moods. Soon enough they will gather as an angry mob into the skies. And then they would leap down from great heights because they missed us, and make my face cold where they land. It was all a miracle made by the Spirit of Water.

I lifted one foot off the ground to feel the tug of gravity. It was tiring to stay that way. But I know it’s Land’s way of pulling us into a hug. The Spirit of Land makes everything solid. It’s like he has no moods. Oh, I once read about quicksand, so maybe he does.

The birds and the critters of the forest gathered around me, greeting me in a myriad of languages. Their mightier cousins kept watch around us, as they always did. 

I scooped up a few critters and let the rest hop onto my arms and scurry across my back and shoulders. Birds perched themselves, making every somewhat flat inch of my body a roost. The Spirit of Fauna adored me, for reasons unknown to me.

“We need your help,” a low, aged voice told me. 

The birds scattered in unison and reconvened on the broad shoulders of a towering man. Much of him was brown – his hair, or skin or clothes. He had magnificent white horns on each temple.

The water was quiet now. A tall slender lady, as fair as she was blue, stepped in front of me with her hands clasped in front. 

And finally, an aged man with a little hunch in his shoulders took painful steps towards me. “We need your help,” he repeated.

Fauna, Water and Earth. That was the day they showed themselves to me.

"[WP] Why spend a lifetime training skills when you can just weaponize luck, itself?",mistaque,"""Mom, can you pick up lottery tickets while you're out?!"" I yell from my basement hammock.

""You know you have to buy them or it won't work, honey, we've tried!""
I'd hardly moved from this spot in a month, but I spent so much of the money drunk shopping online that we needed to cash in on more ""luck"" soon.

Maybe you've heard of me, I'm infamously lucky. I would describe it like nuclear luck. I'm exhausted by my curse of ""good luck,"" I crave downtime more than anything, but we need to go to the store. 

I lazily roll out of my hammock, falling hard onto the floor. I love the sound of a good fall. It pops my hip in a way that feels incredible, and oil is now coming out of the ground where I impacted, ruining my new Persian rug!

""Mom, I've struck oil again!""

""I'll call Bill later today, sweetie.""

I grab the keys to one of the cars, I'll find out which by pressing the remote start when I walk outside.

Mom quickly yells, ""You can't drive, you're still drunk!""

I respond by quickly shooting a sidelong glance that's more sideways and wobbly than a sidelong glance usually is, to which she responds,

""You're right, let's go."" 

As I swerve along raucously to the gas station I hit a blind man whose head hits the hood of the car curing his blindness, and I hit another guy killing him instantly. My mom screams and I try to plug my ears quickly to cover the sound from empowering my hangover. Hang-during? I was drunk, obviously, but my head still hurt.

The police recognize my car, so they assumed the worst of the man I killed and don't bother even to stop me. It turned out he was on his way to becoming a serial killer. It would take them a week to piece the clues together. He had a notebook under a floorboard in a hotel room with a fake name detailing the next states in which he planned to murder. He was on his way to case houses in my neighborhood, so he might have ended up trying to kill me. Ha! I'm not sure why the police insisted on informing me of all this later, I always tell them I don't care. Though, I hadn't killed anyone in awhile. 

At the gas station I send mom to get my beers as I put a few hundred in the lottery ticket machine and press buttons randomly. One of the tickets slips out of the top of the accumulating pile and falls on the floor, causing a large, middle-aged woman to slip on it like a banana peel. She lands with a loud crack. I sigh. I don't recognize the woman, so rather than try to explain that she's going to find out she must have a type of cancer that can easily be healed when caught this early, I give her a thousand dollars while she waits for the emergency responders. I'll probably hear about how I saved her life later and get the money back, but for now I have to buy a few extra tickets.

I bring the tickets to the counter. Store Owner Steve complains that someone tried to rob him again. I ask him to keep extra money so that he can pay out my tickets when I come by.

""Did you refuse them?"" I ask, giving no effort to mask my annoyance.

""Yes, of course. His pistol was jammed.""

""Only because he tried...""

""...Because he tried to shoot here, I know.""

""You might make the news again for my winnings today!""

""I know, it's great for business."" He said as he finished scanning. ""Five million. I only have one million.""

""That's fine, mom will collect the rest when you get it in, just give mom the voucher, I don't wanna look at it.""

""Your life's incredible!"" Said Store Manager Steve. ""Why do you hate it so much?""

""Everything going nonsensically is completely out of my control, and everything that happens to me is so extreme. I don't want this life, I just want to be able to relax! All these ridiculous things happening to me and around me, all I want is for things to not be happening for a little while!"" I yell, as my angry hand-gesturing knocks a gun out of a would-be assailant's hands and into the trash can. He runs. 

""Mom, can you drive home please? I'm gonna sleep in the back.""

""Of course, sweetie.""",scrumbdle

    SUPER:  Microscopic closeup of a cluster of brain cells.

Applause roars.  A young Klara Hitler pauses at her reflection in a doctor's office.  She *agrees to have the abortion.*

The announcer holds up a Silver Medal.  ""And coming in 2nd place...""

The announcer bows reverently to his microphone.  A high pitched *zeee* fills the sadium.  A mosquito hovers over the microphone.  His proboscis smiles in its own way.

The crowd goes wild.  A critical mass of Vuvuzelas turn the stadium into a Bugz Wet Dream.

The announcer waits for the excitement to die down.  It grows quiet.  He stares in silence.  A Japanese Cosplay nurse wheels out a 100-inch monochrome screen.  An ultrasound image appears of two fetal twins. 

The announcer's eyes widen.  ""And now it gives me great pleasure to announce the Gold Medal winner of The 23^rd  TTHO.""

One of the twins in the womb hugs the other one. The crowd says, ""Aww,"" in unison.

The monitor goes blank.  The crows *gasps*.

The announcer looks around nervously.  He places the Gold Medal on the monitor, which makes the image reappear.  One twin is gently playing bounce with the other twin's decapitated head.  The amniotic fluid gives a surreal and peaceful replay aesthetic to the motions.

&gt; you're dead

Reese glanced to his left.

Just great.

Varsity quarterback Trevor O'Conner and his two friends were staring daggers at him. As Reese stared back, Trevor raised his hands, punching one into the other.

Trevor fought the urge to roll his eyes.

Really?

He'd been fielding the jocks' not-so-veiled threats for the past two weeks, and all because Trevor's girlfriend had gotten partnered up with Reese for a physics project that month.

Reese let out a sigh. He did not need to deal with any of this right now… He had college essays and admissions to deal with, not whatever duel of honor Trevor seemed to be hungering for.

In his heart, Reese knew he should avoid the conflict. If he kept his head high and cheek turned, ignored their constant death threats, took a punch, occasionally threw one of his own… then once graduation rolled around, he'd never have to see Trevor's stupid face for the rest of his life.

But underneath raged the unfairness of it all. Why did he have to be the bigger person? Reese had powers! He should've been able to use them! And not only that, but their school had a zero tolerance policy on fighting. Assuming a teacher saw Reese getting beat up, both of them would get in trouble, and nothing said ""ACCEPT ME!"" to a college admissions board like a suspension.

Reese stared at Trevor's note a bit longer before crumpling it back up.

It was time he took care of the situation. Permanently.

—

The large shed behind the gym had started falling into disrepair years ago, and with the state's recent budget cuts no one at the school was making much of a protest to fix it. It stood, shabby and unloved… the perfect place for a fight.

Trevor was already there with his friends by the time Reese approached. As the smaller boy tossing his backpack off to the side, Trevor let out a snort.

""Here I thought you were some brainiac,"" he said. ""But it looks like you're as stupid as the rest of us. If you think I'm going to go easy on you, you're dead wrong.""

Reese kept still as the three boys surrounded him. They loomed over him, each over six feet and nearing 200 pounds, muscles rippling, their bodies honed to Spartan perfection by years and years of grueling exercise. They'd put in the hours, confident that it'd give them the physical edge in life. A skill of intimidation that was all their own, never to be challenged.

Never to be surpassed.

""You have one last chance,"" Reese said calmly. ""Leave me alone and you won't have to die.""

Trevor stared at him, blinking, and then howled in laughter. His friends quickly joined in.

""You?"" Trevor said, voice still shaking with mirth. ""Trying to threaten us? Like you'd even be able to leave a bruise!""

And with that, Trevor rushed in for the first punch. Reese took a deep breath as his senses took over and ducked, fist passing harmless over his head. One of Trevor's friends swung next.

Reese grit his teeth as he focused on fighting a three-front war… the next several moments and positioning were crucial. He ducked, dodged, letting his abilities slowly, instinctively guide all four of them into place.

*Now!* a voice in the back of his head shouted.

Reese stood his ground, wincing as he let a punch catch him right in the stomach. He stumbled and fell, his back hitting against the shed wall in precisely the right location. Its rotting plywood, hidden from normal eyes, snapped, sending a shockwave all the way up to the roof covered in cheap sheet metal. The bonds holding it in place wavered before snapping off as well.

It shot off the roof and hit all three of his attackers in their chests. It sliced through skin, wedged into bone, and pinned them to the ground.

And just like that it was over.

Reese picked himself up. As soon as he'd hobbled a safe distance way, the rest of the shed collapsed, burying Trevor O'Conner and his two friends.

He surveyed the destruction, felt the possibilities of the boys' survival waver lower… and then lower…

Reese shrugged his backpack back over his shoulders and left.",roxannepark

He had died at the ripe old age of eighty-seven, believing that he had spent his life rebelling against one of the most powerful forces man subjects himself to: morality.

And yet, there he stood, slack-jawed at the sight of his name atop the board.

Timothy's trance was instantly broken, his face contorting into a gruesome scowl. ""No, I'm not! What's the meaning of this? Why am I on here? There must've been some sort of mistake!""

"[WP] A ""popular"" girl falls in love with a ""nerdy"" boy, however he hates her and she spends all her time trying to impress him",pacachii,"Jessica glanced up furtively, checking to make sure he was still there. Satisfied, she turned back to her Biology quiz and absently filled in the multiple choices. It didn't bother her that she would likely fail the test. Nothing bothered her anymore, except for the idea that she might lose Andy. This was the thought that kept her mind in a perpetual whirlwind of doubt and her body in a constant flurry of anxiety. She looked up again. Still there. Good.

The bell rung and Jessica forced herself to remain seated. It wouldn't do to be noticed, and in any case, Andy was still frantically scribbling. She bit into her lower lip, holding fast with anticipation until most of the class turned in their papers. As Andy began doing the same, Jessica stood up, forcing her tensely wooden body into a casual saunter. She tasted blood from her gnawed lip and quickly licked away. *Nothing out of the ordinary,* she thought.

Jessica maintained a safe distance from Andy, keeping her eyes downcast and relying on the self-graffiti'd skull and crossbones that adorned the sides of his black and white Chuck Taylors. Her chest swelled with a torrent of fire as she swallowed the urge to gaze up, to glance at his greasy, unkempt mane and slender, undefined physique. *I will have him soon enough*, she reminded herself.

Andy reached the end of the hallway and paused at the heavy glass doors that led out of the building. Jessica drew a sharp breath and felt a momentary panic as he rested a hand on the handle, before turning to his right and entering the adjacent Men's Room. Jessica sighed, uttering a silent gratitude to whichever cruelly benevolent god had allowed this dance to go forward. Without so much as checking her surroundings, she followed him in.

Two boys were standing at the long row of urinals. One jumped back, furiously fumbling at his zipper, while the other several rows away just stared with an expression of confusion. ""Girl, this is the Men's Room, what the hell..."" Jessica fixed a withering gaze on both. ""Out,"" she snarled. Both shuffled quickly away, sliding with deliberate distance around Jessica and casting wary, sidelong glances at her as they left. She locked the door. It didn't matter who saw her, anymore.

Jessica began to walk past the row of stalls across from the urinals. Empty. Empty. Empty. She reached the last one at the end, next to the frosted glass window that led outside. She glanced down and breathed a deep, exhilarating sigh of relief. Skull and bones on black and white. The heady smell of cheap weed emanated from inside. Suddenly, a wave of panic rushed over her. *I haven't planned for this moment,* she realized. With the crushing fear that she would lose her nerve or run out of time, Jessica knocked impulsively on the stall door.

""Uh, it's occupied, asshole,"" came the annoyed response. She knocked again. Harder. ""What the fuck? Go away, man."" Once more. She heard a shuffling of paper and plastic, followed by the toilet flushing and a quick succession of misty sprays. The door swung open with a snap, forcing Jessica to jump back. ""This is a violation of my human...""

She stared at him for an eternal few seconds. His puffy, acne scarred face fell into a lithely bony frame, wrapped in an amalgam of black cloth, leather, and chains. For his part, Andy stared back, his features a wash of befuddlement and disbelief. *The calm before the storm,* thought Jessica, eager with anticipation. ""Who the hell..."" Andy began, and then his eyes went wide.

Jessica smiled, a huge grin that felt like it was going to fly off the sides of her face. ""You remember,"" she crooned. ""I...no, it was a mistake. Shit. I was stupid. I never meant for anything to happen."" Jessica's face dropped into a scowl; an instantaneous transition that sent Andy several paces back into the stall. His hands grasped desperately at his sides, seeking traction or safety or *something* to stabilize his world. ""She was 12, you fucking pig,"" Jessica replied, a glistening edge emerging from her pocket.",MavisMudslide

Especially because it gives the guy more depth than just ""average and nerdy"". Maybe he's already taken or maybe he's just not into girls with an aggressive personality like her. He tries to keep his head down, because that's the only way he knows how to deal with school drama.

I couldn’t help myself. There was some kind of unstoppable chemical reaction happening inside of me. I was experiencing heart palpitations, a rapid pulse, and shallow breathing – my physical state was literally the side effects disclaimer from a prescription drug commercial.


*Phhhhhh—thwoosh*. I took a deep breath and focused on the reality of the situation. What—or rather who – was causing the unpredicted humidity south of my waistband? Tobias Finch. I flushed red with the realization. I couldn’t even pretend to be repulsed—just embarrassed by how damned turned on I was. 


It wasn’t just my obvious physical attraction that made me want Tobias. I felt the first pangs of attraction when we paired up during our Creative Writing class. I’m one of the only seniors a class full of overachieving sophomores. I’d like to say it was Fate, but in reality, it was Ms.Thompson whom I can thank for that initial pairing.

 
“Write a description of a transformative personal experience,” Ms.T had instructed us before pairing us off at random. 


I wrote about flying on a plane for the first time. *We got on the plane and all of a sudden we were taking off. As the wheels lifted off the runway and we ascended into the sky, I couldn’t help but notice how the city that looks so massive and overwhelming up close looks so tiny and insignificant from far away…*


“I didn’t really have enough time to finish writing it,” I said, trying to sound nonchalant even though I really did care. 


“What were you going to say next?” he asked, brushing his thick black bangs out of his eyes. 


“I wasn’t quite sure what I would say next. It was transformative because I was really scared of flying, you know? So I was scared, and then there I was, looking at how small everybody looks from a distance, and thinking how unimportant my own little life is in the grand scheme of things. It just felt very…deep.”

""Colin, what's she doing here?"" Matthew asked his Game Master after he greeted at him at a local gaming guild.

""Uhm, she said she wants to play,"" a clumsy reply came as Colin was fumbling through his bag trying to prepare for their session. A thought of complaining came across Matt's mind, but instead he just fixed his glasses and sat down. Two more people showed up for the session, two less than anticipated, but Colin was ready to go.

""So, Stacy is new here and she wants to play an elf ranger...""

""Like Legolas!"" She blurted with a giant smile aimed at Matthew. His lips tightened. 

""Yes, that's right, like Legolas,"" Colin agreed.

""You see Matt, I know my Lords of the Ring,"" she winked at him oblivious to his wide eyes and steam coming out of his ears. 

""However Stacy, Matt is also an elf ranger... Like Legolas,"" he said hopeful for a smile, but continued when it didn't come, ""so I thought it'd be better to diversify a little.""

She put on a pout that could knock down anyone in their high-school, Colin included, but Matt put on a satisfied smirk. Then her face lit up.

""I can be that red-headed girl! Legolas' girlfriend! And you can be Legolas, Matt!""

He sheepishly looked at Colin who looked back at him the same way. They just stared at each other frozen while she went on.

""What was her name Terri? Tammy? Can I be Stacy?"" 

""You already are,"" Colin said in what he thought was a charming way, yet it came off a bit creepy.

""Sure,"" she agreed while trying to catch Matt's eyes.

An hour or so later, Matt has developed a tactic in their combat - he'd always position himself behind Stacy hoping a bad dice roll would accidentally kill her. Determined not to let the pretty girl die, Colin would redirect his bad throws and Matt was losing his patience. 

""Okay, so the half-orc barbarian is here,"" he said pointing at a little figure.

""You don't have anymore arrows,"" Colin warned him. Matt sighed and massaged his scalp as he observer the board. He didn't have enough movement points to go around Stacy to engage the half-orc with his shortsword...

""I run,"" he said confidently while moving his little figure towards Stacy and the barbarian. 

""My hero is coming to save me!"" Stacy squeaked at Matt while giving him the biggest teasing smile. His nostrils flared again, but other than that he ignored her.

""I jump on her shoulders,"" he said remembering well enough his sharpened cleats used for wood climbing, ""and jump on the half-orc, slicing his head in half,"" he finished with a grin ton an awe struck Stacy.

""That is so cool,"" she said in a very normal tone. Matt took the d20 and rolled.

1.

""You fail the jump and knock Stacy down,"" Colin said. ""Stacy, your move.""

""Is he still laying on top of me?"" she asked wide-eyed. 

""Sure,"" Colin sighed.

""I want to talk to him,"" she said calmly.

""The half-orc?"" Colin asked while his eyebrows raised.

""No, Matt.""

""You mean Thalmor.""

""Sure.""

""Okay, what do you want to tell him?""

""Thalmor, I think we need to be together. Ever since I looked at your big brown eyes, I knew there was a place there for me.""

*Thalmor has green eyes*, Matt thought, still trying to fight himself. 

""This quest had no meaning to me. In truth, I only wanted what I have now. A bittersweet smile is upon my lips now, as we lay here probably moments away from death.""

""Can I...""

""What?"" Colin answered Matt's feeble attempt at interjecting himself. 

""Avoid this?"" Matt finished quietly.

Colin waved at him to throw the throw the dice.

1.

""You fall in love. You kiss her passionately,"" Colin said in a monotone voice. 

Stacy uttered a girlish squeak.

""Half-orc's on the move. He raises his ax and... Hits both of you. He carved through your skulls as you were kissing. You're both dead,"" Colin finished and gathered his dice and started packing. 

It was a while until the shocked group left and Matt and Stacy were the only ones left at the table. His heart was beating a lot faster that he was used to and that scared him. Yet something inside him urged him to stay.

""I meant that Matt,"" Stacy said. Her eyes were low and she was playing with her nails. 

""I know.""

She lifted her head tentatively. 

""So, why not?""

""I don't know,"" he replied while staring at her hands while she was still playing with her nails.

""Am I not pretty enough for you?"" 

""No! It's just... I don't know.""

He looked at her and saw tears swelling in her eyes.

""Stop that,"" he said and caught her hands.

Cassie sighed a deep sigh as she walked into Theatre II, first period. She looked over at CJ casually playing on his years-old 3DS. The sounds indicated he was playing at iteration of smash. 

She sat two seats away from him as always, with Cade and Katherine between them. As Mrs. Garcia began calling roll, she silently waited for her name.

""Elizabeth Allison?"" ""Here.""

""Cassie Britfield?""

CJ looked so cute in his TMNT jacket.

""CASSIE!"" 

""HERE!"" she cried, startled.

As soon as roll finished, people automatically rose to go attend to final details. That afternoon, the class was headed to an elementary school to perform a children's play - a sort of CD, hopefully maturing into one or two theatre department members in four to nine years. Cassie was playing a bratty princess, and CJ a kind grandfather.

Miraculously, she and CJ were both on set crew. She used this time to attempt to flirt; saying hi, asking about his interests, flipping her hair, the works. She knew she was gorgeous, but not in a self-centered way; she knew she had a good body and long, soft black hair. She just wished it mattered to CJ. NOTHING seemed to matter to him; did he even have a sex drive? 

Thoughts of that had to be pushed out of her mind for now, there were set pieces to load up. After an hour of work, they were ready. A short drive to the elementary school later, they were setting up.

During which, of course, CJ went back to playing on his DS. He was too adorable to disturb, so she went about the set setup herself. Following setup, the little kids filed into the cafetorium in neat lines under the tyrannical watch of early education majors. 

CJ was amazing in his performance, as always. Hidden beneath the hoodie and long, unkempt hair was a veritable acting genius. He made the kids laugh when he wanted them to laugh and they calmed when he wanted them quiet. As he came backstage once his parts were over, she congratulated him.

""Thanks, Cassie! You were great too!"" He replied, ever kind. He knew she liked him and so tried to be nice in the stead of romantic interest. It just hurt more. Two years of patient kindness, not one loving word or look in return. 

After the show ended and four hundred children were high-fived, striking the set was the next step. CJ thankfully worked diligently at this as opposed to setup and the work was going quickly until they crashed into each other on the tiny stage. Cassie fell backwards while CJ hit a wall and slid down it. Ever the closet gentleman, CJ scurried over to Cassie to make sure she was okay.

""Are you hurt?"" He asked, worry on his face. 

Cassie found it amusing that he still worried when it was a simple tumble. He had never been this close to her; he was directly above her, by maybe a foot. An irrational thought took her mind and she let it act out - she reached up, put her hand on the back of his neck, sat up on one elbow, and kissed him.

The rest of the day registers as a blur in Cassie's memory. She knows CJ screamed in surprised disgust and toppled backwards, hitting his head on a metal cart (causing yet another yell). People came to the scene and laughed. She sat in silence during the drive back and the drive home. It all merged together in a whir of laughter, yells, and green hoodies.

And once she was home, she cried. 

---

Please note that this story is a somewhat dramatized account of an actual event. Names are changed as are certain chronological elements. 

For those who may want to know what happened afterwards, CJ changed to a policy of avoidance of Cassie, which did nothing to affect her feelings. It's now about a calendar year later and she still likes him, and he still will have nothing to do with her. ",siaka_stevens

"[WP] A ""popular"" girl falls in love with a ""nerdy"" boy, however he hates her and she spends all her time trying to impress him",pacachii,"That was five years ago.

A girl named Emelyn Reinn-Lasch suddenly confessed to 18 years old me, who still can't forget someone from further past, even now. I never tried to contact her again ever since, even though I watched her progress closely, almost obsessively, even. I know she was still waiting for me even now.

There were times when I hope I never met her, when I hope she never met me, and neither of us have to hurt each other. But then again, Fate was too cruel to just let me be.

Or maybe Fate was trying to tell me, that there was no use in indulging myself in the past, hurting myself over and over again.

And then there were times when I hope she would just give up on waiting, she deserves someone better than me, someone not shackled by his past. She deserves life with someone who loved her as much as she loved him.

It was not her fault that I met someone just like her in the past. Nor was it her fault that the girl I met six years prior to her confession had accepted my confession, only to disappear and never to be heard again.

It was not her fault that Maya Ellenfelt had broke my heart eleven years ago, and yet she had to suffer because of that. No, it was not Maya's fault either. It was all my fault for still clinging to Maya's shadow, not even giving Emelyn a chance. And yet.....

And yet here she was, still as beautiful as the day she disappeared, no, she was even more beautiful now, standing in front of a convenience store as the sudden downpour drowned all other noise, as if playing a symphony to the tune of my sadness.

""Maya...Ellenfelt....""

""Oh, err, sorry, but who were you again?""

""Oh, I'm sorry, I got the wrong person.""

""You could at least give reasonable excuse, Raph, you just called my full name earlier."" she chuckled ""Where was your glasses? I almost can't recognize you without those, you know?""

I was at loss of words. Maya Ellenfelt, the girl, the only girl that talked to me eleven years ago, the girl that had made me unable to forget her even now, had suddenly appeared in front of me, as abrupt as her disappearance.

""I'm sorry for disappearing so suddenly, you know how my father was.""

""You could at least told me.""

""You know I couldn't...."" she turned towards the rain ""I, I'm sorry. I should at least told you.""

I turned towards the rain, what I heard as a symphony before had turned into a cacophony, a chaos of sound that break my ability to form a concrete thought.

I'm the worst. I had hurt the two people who had selflessly cared about me, who had loved me with their whole heart.

""Sorry, I shouldn't have said that.""

""Still the gloomy one, aren't you."" we turned toward each other at the same time, eyes locked. ""Is that place for me in your heart still exist? Or have you found someone else to fill it?""

""I-"" she stepped forward suddenly, cupping my face in her hands. I hold my breath.

""I'm going to disappear again soon, so, please find your own happiness."" and yet tears fell down your eyes! How could I be happy when you were in so much pain?

But I didn't say anything.

""Please promise me, that you will give her a chance."" I gasped. ""You know that I can't be on your side, so,"" she retracted her hands and wiped her tears.

""But-""

""Don't make her wait any longer. She deserve you."" and still tears flowed out from her eyes. My sight turned a bit blurry, before I realized that I too was crying.

""But she deserve better than me! With her devotion, her willpower, while I would just break her over and over again...""

""Aren't you exactly the same as her? Waiting for me all this years, even rejecting her, your heart had broken too much already, Ralph. It's time for you to find home, happiness.""

""But you are my happiness.""

""I could sue you for copyright infringement, you know?"" another voice came from behind me. As I turned my face, I saw her, holding an umbrella. no, she was holding several umbrellas.

""You should at least wait for the kiss scene, Emelyn."" Maya chuckled, her tears had completely wiped dry.

""As if I would let you do that! And here I am, running through the rain because a certain mysterious person texted me, just to find lovebirds flirting under the rain. I shouldn't have bothered."" she turned away, but Maya took her umbrella and walked past her.

""Take your time.....""

A drop of water drifted from her face, one wouldn't be able to see the difference amidst the rain, but I know.

It was her tears.

I deserve happiness? What a load of crap. She deserved happiness. A happiness I would never able to give to her.

""As if you hadn't hurt enough already...."" I muttered under my breath.

""Did you say something?""

""Nothing. Are you going to give me one of those umbrellas or we have to make do with one?""

""As if!""


""Now, now, don't be shy...""

""Why..."" the beauty in front of me sobbed ""why, of all people, I have to fall in love with you?""

Something is breaking inside my heart when I saw her crying, but I can't do anything, not if I don't want to see her hurt even more.

Truth to be told, I didn't want to see her cry. But the Fate is just too cruel, it let her fall for me, knowing full well that I won't be able to stay by her side.

""And why!"" she looked straight at my eyes, tears on her face ""Why can't you even give me a chance?!""

""I'm sorry.""

The truth is, even now, I don't know the reason.

I don't want to see her hurt.

But I can't do anything.

And yet I let her have the hope. Those lunch we shared together, the time I just can't refuse her dragging me everywhere...

Half of this school inhabitants would kill to become me, and yet I....

""I'm sorry, for giving you too much hope. I should have told you the first time we met.""

She wiped her face.

""No, I should have known this. From the very beginning. You....""

""It's not your fault....""

""Then whose fault was that? Huh? Whose fault was it that I looked just like *her*, that my voice just like *hers*, that every.single.thing. that I did remind you of *her*?""

She hugged me, I tried my best not to flinch.

""It's my fault for trying to find her in you. It was my fault for not being able to move on from her. So I'm sorry."" I took her hand, and turned away.

""May you find your happiness.""

""But *you* are my happiness.""

""Then wait for me, until the sky on my heart had a place for another star to shine in it.""

*I know where you live, Brad Dunkirk.*


Brad didn't reply. Thoughts went straight to his phone to call up the police for cybercrime, but the messages kept on coming.


*Can we just talk? It's me Tyra from Algebra class.*


He was trying to furiously type a reply along the lines of *leave me alone you creepy stalker, this is wrong and you should feel bad.*  What he actually ended up typing was:


*k*.



Suddenly, Brad's mother called.  ""It's for you Brad, a girl named Tyr-rah? Tye-rah? She says she knows you from school.""


""I'm busy! Tell her to call back later!"" *Later being never please*.  He left the latter part out, his mind trying to imagine ways to avoid school.


The messages came through again on the console.  


*I upgrade my admiral to find you, I knew you were a level eight Ork player with a battleship called the ENDLESS DOOMHAMMER*.


His thick glasses were at the edge of his nose.  Pushing them up ever so slightly, he continued to read the messages.


*I just wanted to talk with you! We're so alike! :)*


""Couldn't be further than the truth"" he said quietly to himself, thinking of the 40k grimdark lore. Orks being pirates and largely primitive beasts created as an organic tool to help the Old Ones fend off the Necrons.  Eldar could not relate to the Orks in any meaningful way, especially in space, not in Battlefleet Gothic Armada.


Brad did what any sane person would do.

"[WP] A ""popular"" girl falls in love with a ""nerdy"" boy, however he hates her and she spends all her time trying to impress him",pacachii,"""For the last time Samantha, cut it out! This is getting so weird!""

The girl withdrew her hand from the boy's arm, hurt flooding her eyes even as she brushed her dark hair away from her now bright blue, speckled skin and then huffed with frustration.

""Sam, come on. No one has been into Avatar since like, 2011. And how long did you spend on that weird blue alien costume anyways?""

""Na'vi."" The girl corrected him mechanically, reflexively.

""Okay, Na'vi -- whatever. Either way, showing up at my place in these outfits... it's got to stop. Weren't you dating... what's his name, Brad? Kyle?""

""Derek, his name was Derek. We're not together anymore."" Sam's voice was soft and quiet as she supplied the name, her gaze downcast at her feet.

""Look, Sam, we used to be kind of friends. I mean, we didn't hang out and you share NO interests with me, but it was fine having you around the gang. Can't we just go back to that? Showing up in dirty storm trooper outfits isn't--""

""Sand trooper."" Again, the correction was automatic; mechanical and fast.

""Right, right. Sand troopers. Those are the ones from.. uh..."" Mark paused, his brain blanking on which Star Wars the trooper variant had first appeared in.

""A New Hope.""

Sam supplied to answer so easily and smoothly that it caused Mark to pause, and he looked back at her blue, artfully done face with suspicion and a sudden spark of insight.

""Released?"" He queried.

""1977.""

""Produced by?""

""Gary Kutz, but Rick McCallum did the special edition.""

""What was the character name for the opera singer in Fifth Element?""

""Diva Plavalaguna.""

""In what movie are ancient mythologies the result of alien interference in early human history?""

There's a momentary pause now by Sam, but the lapse is fleeting before her eyes flash with challenge and she angles her chin at the boy standing in front of her defiantly.

""Stargate, 1994, directed by Roland Emm--""

""WOW Sam! You're a total NERD!""

Mark dissolved into a fit of wild laughter, and if her face hadn't been covered in paint he would have seen the furious blush that bloomed over Sam's pretty features. She shifted uncomfortably from foot to foot as he regained his composure, leaning against the doorframe of his front door, wiping tears of humor from his eyes.

""Have you been HIDING that all these years?""

Sam's mouth worked silently for a moment, trying to drudge up words stuck in her throat before she finally pushed them out past her lips.

""YES! Okay?! Are you happy? I-I like you so much because you like all the things I like! But my parents always said that Star Wars and Alien and Iron Man were things meant for boys, not pretty little girls in dresses. And then, well, then I was in cheerleading and they would have made fun of me! But when we graduated that all stopped mattering and I-I-I---!""

She was near tears herself now, but not the same mirthful kind Mark had shed. Seeing this his features dropped into guilt and he pushed away from the door frame, tentatively laying a hand on her arm.

""Okay! Okay, I get it Sam. Come on; lets watch a movie or something. You're going to have to sit on a towel though, I don't want that blue stuff all over my couch.""

""Thanks Mark. Really, thanks.""

""Don't mention it, Sam. Like really, don't mention it. You're totally going to mess up my street cred with the gang.""

She was giggling now as he gently directed her past him, into the apartment and the closed the door with a muffled click.

"[WP] A ""popular"" girl falls in love with a ""nerdy"" boy, however he hates her and she spends all her time trying to impress him",pacachii,"Jonathan ran, his arms outstretched behind him, like the wings of a mighty bird of prey.  He flew through  the classroom leaping past desks and his classmates alike. He stopped at Billy's desk and karate chopped the papers and books onto the floor. Jonathan squealed in glee as he fled the scene at breakneck speed. 

It was recess and only Billy remained at his desk going over See Jack Run over and over. For such a classical piece of literature Billy thought it was remarkably difficult to understand.  Billy took his time though, he was going to be smart, he was going to graduate and finally make the millions he had dreamt about his whole life. Billy knew he could achieve anything he set his mind to, so he set his sights on the books before him.

Julie watched from across the room, surrounded by her usual gaggle of giggling girls and the occasional boy who managed to muster enough courage to try and actually talk to her.  She was queen bee, and the swarm of boys that buzzed around the room amused her. Julie knew that with a word, any of these boys would quit showing off and do whatever she asked. All of them except Billy.  She looked at Jonathan as he ran up to her to collect his reward; a small hug, and a smile that was thought to be a major factor of global warming by those blessed enough to receive one.  Jonathan tried to talk to her, but he was quickly dismissed by Julie's annoyed look. The girls closed ranks around Julie, scavenging Jonathans momentary attentiveness to boost their own standings.  The vultures, thought Julie, but only for a moment as she looked back at Billy struggling his way through Math now.  Julie mumbled to softly to herself, thinking of new schemes to once and for all have every person in the class recognize her greatness.  A small thought emerged in her pretty little head, if she could just have Billy, she would need anyone else.

Billy sat in his usual chair at the front of the class, he had transferred a week ago, and was still completely oblivious to the social interactions of his classmates. That suited him well though, all Billy needed was his studies. If only that girl Julie would stop trying to get my attention, Billy thought. Once again another boy flew past knocking Billy's school supplies onto the floor.  Billy shook his head, he knew he was a bit bigger than the other kids, but Billy knew violence would only get him in trouble. He lowered his head back into the crevasse of his math book and tried to figure out why some numbers were so darn smug. Darn prime numbers, think their better than everyone else, Billy thought.

She had done all the classic moves; laughed at all his jokes, picked him for her group projects; she had even gone so far as to pinch AND punch him, in one day nonetheless. What else would it take to get Billy to notice her, Julie contemplated.  Finally she had had it, a week had passed and graduation was approaching quickly for Billy, she had to act fast.  With the help of her friends and lackeys, no one knew which they were, Julie created her grandest scheme yet.  She would make him love her even if she had to do so by force.  On the day of Billy's graduation Julie put on her cutest outfit and ran to class, she was determined to kiss him before he left. Everyone in the class knew her plan except the teacher and of course Billy himself. 

Billy knew something was wrong as he entered the classroom for his last time, he was finally moving on to the next grade.  As he walked through the door Julie leapt from the side and grasped his neck firmly in her arms as she went for her big moment, but Billy brought one hand around and stopped her lips cold with his oddly large palm. 

Julie was stunned, ""WHY"" she screamed. ""Why don't you like me"", she hadn't meant to be so loud, but the rejection shook her to the core.

Billy stumbled back shocked, ""WHY"", he said incredulously. ""I'm 27 years old, that is WHY"" Billy whined.

I haven't seen Billy in some time, but as his former teacher I do keep track of my students.  I hear Billy is doing quite well, something about a hotel chain. Very impressive stuff.  Julie never recovered from the incident.  I hear she became some kind of public relations director at a golf course, but the man she is with is just horrible, some ass named Shooter McGavin. I do hope she find someone better someday. Oh well, till next time, on stories from behind the teachers desk.

"[WP] A ""popular"" girl falls in love with a ""nerdy"" boy, however he hates her and she spends all her time trying to impress him",pacachii,"Dear Diary, Samantha here, 

""Why wasn't he afraid?"" I mused over this, wondering why HE of all people could be so nonchalant over my boyfriends threats. Chance was one of the robotics kids at our school. Really, he was just a nobody. Then there’s me, Samantha, queen bee of our high-school, cheerleader elite. I was dating Darren, the Quarterback and All-American.

It all started on that damn day when Darren and I were walking down the hall with some of his jock buddies. Honestly, I don't know what they were talking about really, but I just smiled and faked laughed as usual. I was looking back and making a comment to one of the boys when suddenly Darren started yelling. 

""Watch where you’re going dumbass."" Darren snarled. In front of Darren was Chance. It looked like they had just bumped into one another. Chance, had dropped some books and was picking them up. Most guys (especially ones that looked like Chance, dark haired, glasses, and ill advised outfit) would have been quaking at the thought of Darren being angry at them, who is 6’4, 200 pounds of pure savory muscle. This time was different, Chance stood up as smoothly as he had bent down to pick up his books, and peered straight into Darren’s eyes. ""Hey man didn't see you there, ill watch out next time."" He said this just as calmly as he picked up his books while adjusting his brown spectacles. In an instant, I saw Darren make a move towards Chance. Knowing his temperament, I grabbed his arm quickly, ""He’s not worth it baby, lets just go."" Darren let up a little and looked back at Chance, who was just staring, not even caring he was about to get his ass-kicked. Darren breathed out, ""I’ll catch you later you little shit."" I gave Chance the I-just-saved-your-ass-nerd look. Then I strutted away with Darren on my arm. 

Dear Diary, Chance here,

What’s wrong with my code? I’ve quadruple checked it already. I can’t seem to figure out one of the last algorithms to help make smooth movement on the robot I've been working on. The robot is designed to help plant crops and diagnose levels of nutrients in the ground. Plus it's also meant to help aging farmers move around. I’ve been working on this robot for years actually, I got the idea for it after I helped code a cost effective insulin pump for the poor (the idea came to me because my test subject was a farmer with diabetes). Anyway, my day actually became a lot more interesting because within this train of thought I was having about the algorithm, I ran into a much less metaphorical train.

""Watch where you’re going dumbass."" Snarled the high-school Quarterback Darren. A big oaf, whom I am sorry to say doesn't have the same intelligence as his size. As I was picking up my books, I noticed he was with his buddies and his girlfriend Samantha. Who as far as I was concerned, was queen bitch of our school. The truth is, Darren and his group didn't scare me at all. What these guys don't know about me is that I am the state’s Golden Gloves silver-medalist in boxing's light heavy-weight division (courtesy of my mother pushing me, rest her soul). So, even if they were to try and fight me I'm pretty sure I actually had more real fight experience than all of them combined (and IQ too). My mother never wanted me to fight outside the ring, and always wanted me to be a good kid that focused on my studies and the needs of others. So instead, I just told him sorry, to which he retorted something stupider than he looks. His girlfriend pulled him away and gave me a look of contempt. Something which I mirrored back. I had no time for her kind of people. After that, I just continued onto the robotics lab, where I had more pressing issues to delve into.

Dear Diary, Samantha here,

I find myself not being able to stop thinking about Chance all weekend. The way he was so calm when dealing with Darren peaked my interest him. So, this week, I found myself looking out the school yard, the halls, and classrooms to get a glance of Chance. Glance of Chance, ha that sounds so poetic. Anyway, this week I saw something that got to me that I made my stomach drop. 

I was walking by the robotics lab when I saw him there, sitting at the desk staring into his Macbook Pro. There were some other people around him and a girl that was sitting close, ""damn her"" I thought. Suddenly, I realized I was jealous. Not only was I jealous of another girl, it was over a nerd at our school. How could that be possible? Furthermore, that’s not the thing that got me. Truth is, over the past week I have taken the long route to pass by the robotics lab to catch a glimpse of Chance. I noticed that he works tirelessly in school and after school to work on his projects. I started to become curious as to what he was actually working on. There was a girl sitting by me in one of my classes that works in the robotics club with Chance. I asked her casually what they were working on, not to give myself away. She said that they were working on devices to help improve the lives of people around them. ""What a joke!"" I found myself berating her. ""What makes you think that you can change anything?"" However, as I said this, all I felt was myself being more intrigued by Chance and a little guilt too. I blushed just thinking about him.

Finally, on Friday of this week. I decided that I was gonna muster up the courage to talk to him. In spite of the possible repercussions it might have. Who knows? Maybe ill just ask him some stupid physics question to make it seem more natural? So finally, after third period I went walked towards the robotics center wondering what I would say to him. Right before I got into the door hit someone, Whack, I looked up and I saw bright brown glasses, and all I could muster was 

""Hey."" 

Dear Diary, Chance here,

I worked my butt off this week and have found myself really close to cracking the code. However, thats not really what I want to write about. This week I noticed something kind of strange. Every time that I am in the robotics lab I have started to see Samantha walk by the robotics window and peer in for a second, then she just shuffles away. I really don't understand it and wish she would just stop. I'm pretty sure she's just coming by to make fun of me or some of the people in robotics. It’s getting pretty annoying. So I decided that the next time she would come by I would give her a piece of my mind. This Friday I would do it. 

So when the time came after third period, (which is usually when she comes through) I saw her slowly walking by. This time she wasn't looking through the window but it seemed like she was muttering something to herself. No matter. I got up and walked to the door and opened it. Whack. She was much closer than I realized and as I opened the door I just ran myself into her by accident. She looked up at me with her big (now that I'm up closer) extremely beautiful blue eyes. I lost train of thought and just blurted out

Because the schools were so small, ""popular"" may not be the same thing as in a large public school, but I was the girl you're describing. I don't have cred to list about describing myself as a queen bee in these settings other than to say that I was met with either very extreme admiration by my peers, or with fear. I heard at the second school, a boarding school, the boys said in the dorm sometimes how eager they were for ""a chance with me"" or something, when they had girlfriends. It was a ""top picks of the school"" kind of thing, and every person said me.

High school didn't suck, but I was, at the time, genuinely into Brian, and no one believed me, and it was rejection like everyone feels it.",pennycenturie

"[WP] A ""popular"" girl falls in love with a ""nerdy"" boy, however he hates her and she spends all her time trying to impress him",pacachii,"I was always the popular girl. Guys would always swoon and look at me, or I'd get hit on by all the big jocks. I didn't understand though. Why me? Yes, I know I'm pretty and all, but I'm so insecure about my personality, I just don't understand. 

""You look beautiful today."" said this jock named Noah. I always found him kind of creepy.

""Uh... Thanks."" I said with an awkward smile. 

I continued walking down the hallway and into my anatomy class. I noticed this boy... Beautiful brown locks, his big brown eyes shot at me in the distance. I immediately put my head down because I was too scared to even look at him. He was wearing a Marvel shirt, and his binder had all sorts of science and Marvel, and other stuff that I couldn't really make out on it. He was definitely a total nerd. 

I took a shot and sat next to him. What could hurt, really.

""Hi."" I said. 

""H-Hi."" He stuttered a little bit. 

""I'm Sarah."" I held out my hand so he could shake it.

""Pete."" He said slowly and confused, as he shook my hand. 

""Look, I don't really know why you're sitting here, but yanno, pretty girls like you don't really come around here often.""

I blushed. ""Haha, why thank you.""

Wait, why did I just thank him? I mean, yes it was a nice compliment but I don't want my looks to be why someone wants to be in a relationship with me. Oh shit, do I like this kid?

I started to flirt with him and play with my hair but he didn't really seem to buy it. He sat there very quietly.

""Now if you'll excuse me."" He got up and sat in the back of the class. I was super confused...

Class ended, and I happened to catch him.

""Hey, why'd you move? I didn't think I was bothering you too much."" I said, grabbing him by the arm.

""Um, well, ya see, you're very... I don't really know how to put it... Clingy. I saw the act you were putting on in there and it really didn't 'wow' me.""

And that was it. Clingy was the one thing he had to say to make me break down in tears.

""Whoa, hey, I didn't think what I said was that harsh, I'm just not interested.""

""No, no."" I said, as I wiped my tears, ""I just, well. Clingy. That's it, that's all you needed to say. I just... I'm always like this. I'm so insecure about myself and that was the one thing you had to say. I know I'm pretty but that's all people see in me. No one really wants to get to know me and when they do, that's what they say. They say I'm too clingy. I'm lonely, Pete. When people see the real me, they don't like me.""

I stood there, trying to hold back the tears but they just kept flowing.

""Hey,"" he said, ""I'll walk you to your next class.""

I looked up and wiped the last tears as he smiled at me and walked me to my next class.

"[WP] A ""popular"" girl falls in love with a ""nerdy"" boy, however he hates her and she spends all her time trying to impress him",pacachii,"Jess Brown was hands-down the most popular girl in year 11. She was lucky enough to possess the dangerous combination of good looks and great intelligence, causing those around her to almost naturally fall into place as her followers. 

Despite being as blessed as she was, Jess was not an arrogant person. If anything, she liked to take the back seat and observe those around her. She liked to figure out how people worked. What motivated them. Every time she believed she'd got the measure of someone, she'd try out her theory. If she was successful then she could add said person to her 'collection' - those who she believed she had power over.

Boys were easy, and men even easier so. She could get a boys pulse racing and have him do any favour for her she wanted just by undoing her top button and flirting ever so slightly. She once got a man at her local store to straight-up buy her cigarettes just by smiling at him and giggling at everything he said. But that was far too easy.

No, Jess Brown wanted a new challenge. But who?

There wasn't a single boy from the 'popular group' she hadn't collected in her year, and there doesn't exist a word smith with enough skill to convince her to waste her time on a younger male. As she sat in the lunch hall, absent mindedly picking at a bright red apple, she saw a boy walk past. A boy who she hadn't seen before. Bingo. 

Jess sat up in her chair as she surveyed him, like a predator hunting her prey. How would she approach him? What would she use to capture his attention? God, she loved this. The thrill of taking someone down. Using her natural gifts of beauty and brains to see if she could charm and seduce those around her. She didn't like to think like this, but a small part of her felt like she was superior to her peers. Like she was a goddess surrounded by mere mortals. Megan Cartwright, a normal looking girl who looked even more startlingly average when sat next to Jess was trying to engage her in a conversation. Jess ignored her. She didn't have time to listen to trivial gossip and she wasn't in the mood to have everyone's opinions on who was going to win this years *Britain's Got Talent*.

Her mind was racing as she looked him up and down. His uniform seemed clean. She could see his shirt was tucked evenly into his trousers and his blazer fit him well. His trousers hitched up slightly as he walked and she noted his plain black socks underneath. She frowned slightly- he was giving very little away. She couldn't see much of his face, but his black hair seemed messy and almost like he'd not paid it much attention. Well, that was no use to her, half the boys in school were doing that these days. Then she spotted it, under his right arm he was carrying a book. A book to read at *lunch* time?

He's a nerd.

She had work to do.

Jess stood up, and walked over to where the new boy sat reading his book. He was alone. She smirked, this was a good sign for her. A lack of social skills suggests he's nervous or maybe even shy, meaning it was be easy for her to overwhelm him with (hopefully) some of her more basic methods of flattery. 

She sat opposite him, and was slightly taken aback when he didn't immediately acknowledge her presence. Jessica Brown was not given to being ignored. Softly, she cleared her throat. The boy looked up, and she gasped.

Staring back at her were a pair of eyes that held more depth and mystery than any which she had ever encountered before. They were dark, and shining. In that one moment which seemed to last forever, she saw *into him*. Intelligence, maturity, dignity, charisma... Jess was stunned. 

Without even knowing what she was doing, her hand slowly moved up and she did up her top button. That would not work on him. A dry smile slowly stretched across his face.

'Yes?' Was the only word he spoke.

Such brevity. Such confidence. He'd only spoken one word yet she felt like he'd just pelted her with a thousand. *Why are you here? What do you want? Can't you see I'm reading? Do you really think you can 'collect' me?'*

What was *that?* Jess was flustered.

'I.. uh... I just saw you sitting here and I- well, what's that you're reading?'

He paused in thought for a few moments before he replied, and for the first time in her life Jess felt the balance of power change. She gulped while she waited.

'We both know you're not interested in my book, although that's a great shame. It's one of Dostoevsky's greatest pieces. I often find the lunch hall a great place to sit. You see, the library isn't for me. Too much hubbub, too many people bothering me, and if there's one thing I dislike, it's being bothered without reason...'

His eyes lingered over her as he spoke, and Jess had never felt so insignificant in her life.

'Forgive me if I seem confrontational,' he continued 'but I think I know why you came over here. I won't be charmed by cleavage and a cute smile. So if there's nothing else...?' He gestured to her that he wanted to continue reading.

Jess knew when to cut her losses. The best thing she could do now was leave and think of a new way to approach him, the worst thing she could do would be to remain in her upset state and try to appease someone who appeared to see right through her. She was in a state of shock. This was perhaps the first time she'd ever approached a male who appeared utterly uninterested.

Jess stood up and left, catching her leg on the corner of the table and tripping slightly as she went. She heard a soft chuckle behind her.

'What happened?' gushed Megan and the other girls at once.

'You look a bit red, Jess.'

'What did he say?'

'Did he just look over here?'

Jess turned around in a whirl of anger. She could feel hot tears forming in her eyes, but she wouldn't show any weakness in front of these lot.

'None of you are to talk to him, or to tell anyone what happened here. Understood?'

Silenced, the group of girls solemnly nodded.

And with that, Jess left the lunch hall.

Meanwhile, the boy with black eyes deftly licked a finger, turned his page and continued reading. ",imFakeSnake

The room looked enormous without all of my Marvel posters lining the walls and all of my books stacked on their shelves. All that remained was my twin bed &amp; small desk.

The door rang cutting short my farewell to my stripped childhood abode. It was Ava dropping off my Calvin &amp; Hobbes comics. There was no way I was going to head to Berkley &amp; let her keep them. 

She was fidgeting &amp; wouldn't stop talking. She never stops talking. A few months ago she wouldn't even look me in the eyes if we passed each other in the hallways. But she hasn't left me alone since I started tutoring her in physics though. Tough shit. I didn't  care how much she batted her eyelashes at me. I never gave her a free class. Not a single one.

She was rambling more than usual. Something about Kelly Sherman's boyfriend or her dog. I'd clearly missed a vital part of the story because the next thing I know she suddenly blurts out, ""I'm in love with you.""

""Huh?""

""I'm in love with you... I know it sounds crazy... But if you could just hear me out--""

""Hear you out??? Ava. You've scorned me since eight grade. We've been neighbors since preschool. We were best friends until my dad was caught cheating with Principal Johnston and you considered me a social pariah. You told everyone that that was probably why I was valedictorian of our middle school class. You made fun of me because my mom had to use food stamps. I could go on for a good hour for chrissakes."" She flinched.

""You can't hate me. Michael, you've been tutoring me for half a year. We spend every day together... You let me watch Return of the Jedi with you...""

""Look. I'm sorry but I tutored you because it was good money for little work. And I let you watch movies with me sometimes because you lingered and I didn't want to be rude. I never thought you'd misconstrue it as mixed signals or something.""

She looked like she was dealing with Bernoulli's equation. Out of impulse I almost snapped my fingers at her like I used to during our sessions when she'd zone out. 

Then she did the last thing I expected her to do. Shit. She started to tear up. Over me??? Ava Costa does not tear up over dudes. She eats them for breakfast. She's destined to be the ultimate trophy wife meets black widow. I did not have time for this.

""Look, I'm sorry. I'm moving cross country today anyways. It just wouldn't work."" My taxi honked. ""I gotta go."" She wiped the tears from her face as she looked up at me. She almost reminded me of my long lost best friend. The one who used to squeal when I'd climb up a tree too high. The one who wouldn't even be able to water ballon an elephant standing a foot in front of her. The one who bought me a piggy bank as my 10th bday present so we could ""invest"" into it for a year and have enough to buy ourselves Super Soakers our parents had prohibited. 

I picked my duffel bags from the floor and walked out, hoping I don't run into her during Christmas break.

I understand it had to have a twist for the short short story, but while reading I started to remember Soviet movies from 70s about school (half romantic-idealistic, half very realistic and grounded) which had proud and romantic nerds who, in the end, passed silent judgment on shallow peers (boys or girls) and endeared through sheer integrity. Or a halfway example - a great Perestroika movie ""The Courier"" that has a high school graduate slacker who instantly conquered the viewer with his no-bullshit attitude and contempt for any conventions and social mores. He got the girl, yes (not even halfway through the movie), but he didn't give a shit about her romantic expectations, her ""successful"" parents, their shitty friends, or family's expectations towards him.

"[WP] A ""popular"" girl falls in love with a ""nerdy"" boy, however he hates her and she spends all her time trying to impress him",pacachii,"That’s the thing: rules are rules, and they don’t get broken. It all feels a little like a John Hughes movie at the end of the day, doesn’t it? The beautiful peoples club doesn’t mix with the punks, who in turn don’t even look at the nerds, who can’t stand the metalheads, despite a shared interest in Iron Maiden. The BPC sometimes hangs with the smart kids, but the latter is generally too up its own ass for the former and they don’t any deep friendships. 

See? There are rules: you just don’t mix with groups too far outside the personality of your own. A jock dating a metalhead? Never going to happen. A member of the BPC and a smart kid, maybe: at least they’re both from rich families. So, what about a member of the BPC and a nerd? 

For Emma, it started in that computer programming class. Her father, out of some overprotective push for her to “be ready for life,” made her take it; otherwise, she wouldn’t be caught dead there. At first, she hated it like she hated everything else about her school day. Day after day, she sat there, unengaged, wanting to slam her laptop on the floor and storm out. 

The first time she ever knowingly appreciated the beauty of any schoolwork was during the first group project, when she was paired with a boy named Thomas. He was obviously taken with programming; he knew the subject matter even before the teacher explained it and was only in the class for easy credit. His expertise and raw confidence helped her see the fun in the simple calendar app they designed together. He was funny to be around and inspiring to learn from. After that she was hooked on the class. 

Thomas and Emma didn’t speak much after the project. She kept thinking about him, though. It took some time, but she finally realized that she was not just happy about the “A” he helped her get on the project. She realized that she wanted Thomas. 

He was different than the boys she was used to hanging out with. The preening jocks and the cocky sons of lawyers were all, underneath their muscles and expensive clothes, insecure little boys. Thomas, on the other hand, possessed more manly confidence. When he looked at her, his gaze was unwavering, the cadence of his voice calm. Not a single boy in the BPC acted this way. 

Thomas was a completely new experience for Emma. After processing her feelings, she could not look at the males in the BPC the same way anymore. She realized that her feelings for those boys were out of social obligation, not actual attraction. She fell for Thomas, and resolved to make him hers. He was a nerd, so it shouldn’t be that hard, right?

The first time Emma texted Thomas, instead of attraction, he felt mild annoyance.

“Hey! I have a question about coding class… do you mind meeting me to help?”

He was in the middle of focused coding for a website he was building, and his close friends knew not to bother him right now. So when he did answer, several hours later, it was curt.  

“Ok.”

They ended up meeting at a coffee shop, where the façade quickly fell away. Thomas quickly answered Emma’s one or two basic questions about coding. The rest of the time was filled by Emma’s strained flirting and Thomas’ polite, but uninterested, replies. They left after only thirty minutes, both feeling awkward about the meeting. 

When Thomas returned home, he couldn’t wrap his head around what just happened. He recognized Emma’s behavior as flirting, but could not divine her motives. Emma was classically, painfully beautiful. This rendered her constantly surrounded by boys of the BPC, all vying for her attention. “She must want another ‘A’ on the next group project,” he thought. “Mary’s gonna love this!”

Thomas, being an avid programmer, put little personal information on the internet. This included his relationship status, which was “spoken for.” When Thomas told Mary of Emma’s manufactured tutoring session, Mary agreed that Emma was flirting. Mary suggested, however, that Emma’s motives might be romantic instead of scholastic. At the mere suggestion, Thomas ridiculed Emma- her seemingly vacuous personality, her social climbing, and her trying to be someone she wasn’t. Thomas kept going, oblivious to his cruelty toward another human. Mary quickly made Thomas stop; beating a dead horse was not Mary’s style. 

Thomas’ relationship status was quite a shock for Emma the next day when she saw Mary and Thomas together in the parking lot after school. Emma had finally worked up the courage to talk to Thomas. She wanted to chat with him, to just enjoy his company. She rushed away at the sight of Thomas and Mary holding hands. Thomas never spotted her, thank goodness. He was still feeling superior and might have relayed as much to Emma. 

Emma and Thomas did not work together on the next group project in coding class, nor did they speak to one another for the rest of high school. They drifted separately through their senior year unaware that life gives us plenty of chances for reinvention. Emma was already in the process of hers; she knew she wanted to study programming in college, and was feeling strangely pleased by the arched eyebrows her interest in programming spurred among the members of the BPC. Eventually they both became complex adults- both interesting mixes of stereotypically opposing interests, both just following their hearts.

I sidestepped, only for my path to be blocked by the girl I used to admire. Beautiful, smart, talented, kind and dignified. All too perfect. The apple of the teachers’ eyes, the coveted jewel of the school’s male population, and the object of scorn of the females. However, she no longer had that aura that draws so many people to her. At least, not right here in front of me, sobbing and looking forlorn.

""Andrew, please listen to me. I won’t take much of your time, I swear!  Just three minutes! Please just hear me out!""

With a sigh of resignation, I folded my arms. I have an appointment right after this and I am never late. I’m not going to break that principle of mine because of any one. Especially not this girl.

Taking cue, she began her story.

""Andrew, I know this is very sudden for you and it may sound like a really bad joke but I assure you it’s not. I’m really in love with you. I know I’m in no position to ask anything of you, but please don’t ignore me like I’m nothing. It hurts so much.""

Love? Ignore? Hurt? Hang on, that sounds familiar.

""I know I’ve done terrible things to you in the past and you still haven’t forgiven me, but all I ask is for you to give me a chance! I beg you, just one chance! Let me atone for my sins and show you that I’ve changed!""

Chance? Change? Such things never existed for me.

She shoved a heavy-looking paper bag right in front of me, showing me its contents.

""I’ve watched and read it all! Star Wars, the Dune series, Marvel comics and even anime. Look, I even got this Neon Genesis Evangelion limited edition key-chain for you! It’s the one you’ve been looking for, isn’t it? If there’s anything I’ve left out, let me know. Everything and anything that you like or enjoy, I’ll enjoy it too. Just don’t leave me alone…""

Finally breaking down, her legs gave in as she lost her strength to stand. Falling on her knees and sitting right in front of me is the girl I used to love. Tearing up, trembling, and choking. Yet no matter how she looks, I always find it hard to breathe around her. It’s almost like she’s sucking the life out of me. Yet it was the reason I live. It’s the reason why I continued going to school despite the ridicule, the rumours, and the bullying. The reason why I did my best in my academics, the only thing I’ve got going for me. The reason why I turned my back on my precious hobbies, which are kept and sealed away. All of that, just to repair the relationship that was destroyed. Just so I could reach the upper echelons of the school society so that we could be equals. Just so I could be worthy.

Yet my only reward was silence. Utter silence.

I peered into the bag. Sure enough, it has books, DVDs and lots of them. But it is not the full collection. It’s not everything. You can’t have everything in this world. And sometimes, although you can have everything else, you are likely to lack that one or two things, which even if you attempt to trade your entire world for that one thing, you are still not allowed to have it. I deeply understand that fact. 

My eyes are fixed on a frail-looking girl. The same girl who walked away when I needed her the most. I looked right into her eyes, and in return she stared back, desperately looking for something in my eyes. A glimmer of hope, perhaps? As tears continue to streak down her cheeks, my fingers itched.

""Ever heard of the Hedgehog’s dilemma?""

""Huh?"" Her weak voice resonated in the empty hallway.

I squatted down without breaking the eye-contact, so that our eyes are of the same level. She has never looked so delicate and fragile. And I have probably never looked so cold and grim.

""Three minutes is up."" I whispered.

"[WP] A ""popular"" girl falls in love with a ""nerdy"" boy, however he hates her and she spends all her time trying to impress him",pacachii,"Tobias cocked a quizzical (or was it condescending?) eyebrow at me and foisted his paper at me. “Okay, your turn.” 


*My father was driving me home from school. I was already upset because it had been a difficult day, and then we got into a heated argument. At one point, I told him to pull over the car and let me out because I couldn’t stand to be in the same space and breathing the same air as him.* 


*I started walking home, and I was still fuming at my dad. My blood was boiling, and my mind was a playlist on an infinite anger loop. I walked for about an hour like this without really thinking about where I was going. Then I found myself in a clearing in the woods and there was this deer – a doe, a beautiful female deer—just standing there. It was early spring and suddenly I noticed that there were buds on the trees and the leaves were vibrantly green—the kind of green that happens after a heavy rain. I inhaled the earthy scent of rotting leaves and fresh onion grass.* 


*That unblinking doe made eye contact with me. She picked her hoof up and pawed at the ground. Without thinking, I picked my foot up and stamped at the ground. We stood there, gazing into one another’s eyes, for some time after that. I walked up to her and she nuzzled my hand.* 


*I had forgotten all about what brought me to the clearing or what I had been so upset about. I was under the spell of the forest, enchanted by its wild promises.* 


*As I trudged the rest of the way home, I thought about how being part of society requires us to civilize our wild impulses. We don’t stamp our feet at one another because we’re afraid we’d look ridiculous and be ostracized for it. We behave in artificial ways and wear artificial garments while playing games in virtual reality and masking our true impulses and desires.*


“I see what you’re saying here, but if society didn’t curb those desires and impulses, wouldn’t we all just…I dunno, end up killing each other or raping each other whenever the mood struck?” I asked once I had read his paper for the second time. 


“There would still be consequences! I get it, though. You’re saying that as long as we live in groups, we’ll always be limiting our true selves in order to fit in?”


“Umm…sure, if you want to give me credit for that. I’ll allow.” 


“What’s your name again?”


“Linda – it means ‘pretty’ *en espanol*. So when you say my name, you’re also inadvertently giving me a compliment.”


“Riiiighhhhtttt…” he broke off. 


*Idiot*, I thought to myself, *why the hell would you say that*? I clearly wasn’t thinking straight. And since apparently I was enjoying the taste of my foot in my mouth so much, I followed up with this, “Well you are definitely not what I expected – as a writer. Mr.Finch, for someone named after a small feathered creature, you certainly aren’t a birdbrain!” *Stop talking now, Linda. Just smile and don’t even begin to pretend that what you said was actually funny.* 


“Har har. Birdbrain. Verrryyy original,” he paused for a moment as if considering his next move. 


Before he had time to escape, I blurted out, “Maybe we can help each other…ah…improve our writing skills. Here’s my number. I’m dead serious, I need an ‘A’ in this class and I could use your help.” 


“Um…thanks?”

"[WP] A ""popular"" girl falls in love with a ""nerdy"" boy, however he hates her and she spends all her time trying to impress him",pacachii,"'For the last time I am not going back to that game, I become addicted too easily' Daniel texted. The high school student sat in the back end of the lunch hall on a small table for two with his phone and lunch out in front of him.

Daniel had no social group, he was nice enough but showed no interest in getting to know anyone at the school, not even the nerds with whom he shared interests with.

He had built a life out of the internet like so many before him and had grown into it. Whilst many would call it 'sad', he never felt sad. 

He was content with his life for the time being but one person continuously made this difficult for him.

""Dan..."" the voice came from the girl sitting across from him.

""Yes Jennifer?"" asked Dan who put on his best fake smile, keeping his mannerisms in order.

""Can we please sit with other people? You need to speak to others."" Jen gave him a concerned look and with her head gestured to her friends table.

Dan glanced towards the table with everyone on it glaring at him with disgust from the girls or with anger from the guys. 

""Jen... I would want nothing more then for you to sit over there."" Dan replied with a genuine smile on his face. Jennifer laughed at the *joke* and looked into his cold eyes.

""I couldn't leave you alone honey. You really do need some sort of social interaction at least once a day."" Jen replied with another caring tone and grabbed his hand on his phone. Dan attempted to carefully remove her hand with his free one but this caused her to grip more tightly.

""I'm not in the mood to play today, or any other day really."" Dan said back after successfully removing her grip of him. She then grabbed the same hand again with both of her hands and leaned over towards him.

""I'm not playing Dan, I am seriously becoming concerned."" Dan looked straight back at her more forward attempts at connecting with him. Whispers became louder behind her as people were gossiping at her current behaviour. Dan gave a sigh and looked back at his phone.

""Are you sure I can't buy you out of your bet?"" Dan asked trying to type with his other arm.

""There is no bet, sweetie."" she let go of his hand and took a bite out her sandwich, she licked her lips seductively as he glanced up. Dan closed his eyes, turned away and drew a deep breath before looking back at her with another fake smile.

""You know what *honey bun*... You win. I am going to snap now and give everyone a convincing performance for your entertainment."" Jen's eyes widened as she brought her hand to her mouth, going slightly red as a giant grin appeared.

""You've finally called me by a pet name."" she exclaimed.

 ""Go ahead and do whatever you want."" Jen appeared to have not fully heard the rest. Dan gave an angry scowl and slammed his hand into the table.

""Listen Jen, I'm not trying to play hard to get nor am I being extremely shy nor am I extremely pissed off because someone spoiled yet another Game of Thrones plot point!"" Everyone who wasn't already looking at Dan immediately drew their eyes towards him, including the lunch monitors. Jen was taken aback in mild shock but then gave a subtle smirk as she had processed what was happening.

""Well one of those reasons was a lie because yes I am extremely shy when I'm talking to someone I actually like, emphasize on LIKE. I might've cared about Olivia's opinion this point last year because of the crush I had on her! Sorry Olivia for mentioning you in this but you have a cute and sweet factor about yourself that Jen here will never ever have and you deserve to know."" 

Dan looked out towards her and immediately back at Jen to avoid her reaction.

""Your attractiveness, Jen, will never be the defining quality for me, maybe I'm wrong, perhaps I am lying to myself, I really can't tell because I've made that a defining trait in my false reality which I hide myself in because I sometimes can't accept that I'm just like everyone else. But ignoring that possibility I simply don't need approval from the ""hot"" girl, especially you."" 

Jen crossed her arms and legs and sat their with a smile, soaking in the promised performance. Dan noticed her unfazed posture and face but was too committed to stop now.

""I'm 95% sure you're doing this for shits and giggles but, just for humour, let's say it's the 5% where you may actually be attracted to me... I don't think I ever 
could be attracted to you because you are an undeniable bitch in which everything you ever get involved with..."" 

A chair scraping on the floor cut him off as a tall well built guy rose from his seat with a look of fury.

""The fuck did you say to her you fucking ne..."" The furious guy was shortly cut off by Dan who stared back at him with the same intensity.

""Shut the fuck up and sit down, Ted."" Dan replied back. Ted pulled his chair back and began to walk around the table.

""Get the fuck over here you moth..."" Ted shouted over only he was stopped in his tracks by Jen who quickly rose from her seat and turned towards him.

""He said shut the fuck up and sit down Ted!"" Jen screamed at him.

""Jen... The hell are you doing? That little shit is fucking insulting you"" Ted's interruption continued as Jen gave him the death stare.

""Ted. You're not listening to me. I don't have to ruin your life like this Ted."" Jen continued the stare down into his soul. Before Ted slowly backed into his chair in shock and disbelief.

""As you were saying sweetie?"" Jen went back into her previous position as Dan looked at her in realisation that she probably saved him from a near death experience. Dan regained some of his composure before continuing. 

""See this right now, this manipulation attempt to get me to ""let you in"", or *genuine infatuation*, just furthers my point on why I really don't want to continue this relationship you believe we have going on. Another reason is... because I am running out of lines to say and none of this is actually 
phasing you whatsoever, is it?"" 

Dan slumped back into his chair and slammed his face into the desk. The chatter resumed and everyone turned their attention to either Jen or Ted, who was still visibly shaking.

Jen got up from her seat, walked around to the distraught Dan and kneeled down besides him.

""I am really sorry honey, I can see your reasoning behind it, but that's why I really do love you."" Dan pricked up at the word 'love' and turned away from her with a incredibly confused look.

""You always saw through me, you neither liked nor disliked me or whatever I did, you just didn't care about me in any way."" Jen continued.

""Didn't you just hear me? I really do hate you now just like so many others."" Dan still kept his head turned not wanting to look directly at her.

""Only recently though because I'm trying to talk to you. To get you to acknowledge me. Suddenly the boy who doesn't care now has to because I am disrupting his everyday life."" Dan had started to realise what she had been attempting to do for the past few weeks.

""That speech certainly stunned me but it at least it shows that my efforts haven't been in vain."" Jen stroked his hair and before Dan immediately slapped it off his head and sat up.

""...You... really... are good at mind games."" Dan gave her a passive smile. Jen smiled as she stood back and walked back to her side of the table.

""That I am sweetie... But you're still not going to go out with me because of your stubbornness unfortunately. I'll smooth that off soon enough so in the meantime could you make this easier on us both and actually try to have a conversation with me. I'll speak to you soon, Daniel."" 

She blew him a kiss after she had collected her things and walked off with everyone still staring at her, Ted cringed as she walked past his table and profusely apologised.

'Now I'm 100% sure she's manipulating me' Dan thought himself. 

It took him a further 10 mins to get the recent events out of his mind before his phone quickly buzzed. Dan picked up to see had received text message from an unknown number.

'did i mention i adore ur sister :) she really looks up to me and happily gave me ur #! Cant w8 4 our txt talks xD xxx Jen'

Dan looked at his phone with a blank face of emotion, his avenue of escapes from her was slowly shortening and he was becoming seriously worried about his well-being. Dan then reached into his wallet and took out a coin.

'Heads I die by hanging myself, Tails I die by her hands' he flipped the coin into the air and let it land in front of him. He stared across the room not even glancing at the coin and muttered to himself.

So at this point in the story, it’s worth mentioning that normally, guys like Tobias aren’t even on my radar. For starters, he’s an underclassman, and I’m usually into older guys with 5 o’clock shadows and deep, low voices. He’s average height, pale, and lanky with dark hair and green eyes. He has the kind of long eyelashes that women work hard to emulate using mascara, and men have no right to possess naturally. And ever since we paired up in class, I was absolutely obsessed. 


I have never tried so hard to impress a man in my life. I worked hard on my physical appearance, straightening my hair, strategically reapplying make up before our class together, and trying to figure out which outfits would be a turn on without being slutty. I admired Tobias’ mind, and not just his physical appearance. This was the reason I was going weak in the knees every time he sat down next to me. I could make a shallow physical impression on any man, but I wanted to *woo* Tobias. 


Our texting began innocently enough. We chatted about schoolwork. One time I asked him when an assignment was due. He was absent one day from class and he asked what he had missed while he was out. It was all business, for a time. 


It should be noted that we very rarely spoke in person. We were cordial, but there was not a lot of overlap in our friend groups. Not to mention the fact that ever since the initial “birdbrain” incident, I didn’t trust my tongue around him. 


Winter was beginning to fade into spring. The sun was shining and temperatures and hemlines were both going up. Ms.Thompson was teaching us about carpe diem poems. “Gather ye rosebuds while ye may…” was echoing through my brain as I considered my predicament. 


Late that night, I decided to take matters into my own hands. *So I was thinking about that poem we read in class today…and I want to confess something to you…*I began. 


He began to type, then he must have erased what he wrote and waited for me to continue.


*I’m wearing black lace thigh-high stockings with a tight black skirt. But I seem to have misplaced my panties…what ever shall I do?*


That was the first time we sexted. And it was amazing. 


I was excited to see him in class the next day, but he acted as though nothing had happened. As though we hadn’t shared intimate details about what we would like to do to one another’s bodies in graphic detail just a short while ago. My body thrummed with the excitement of being near him and the air seemed to crackle with sexually charged electricity. Yet he ignored me. I really did not understand this man. 


*I may never be able to sit properly in class again if you keep dressing so inappropriately, little miss Linda,* he texted. 


*Oh! Well I never!* I responded. 


*I think the lady doth protest too much…* he said. *I’ll give the lady something she doth protest, allright…*

""More or less..."" The teen shifted awkwardly, scooting a little to give the girl - and himself - some breathing room. She quickly filled the gap. ""I-It's more rare than anything.""

""Ooooh..."" She spoke with the interest of someone reading a text they had just received from the weather man that a fifteen day saga of nice weather was to continue.

... and that was pretty much it for her input.

He'd entertained her like this for months now. At first it had been nice. Someone had been taking interest, clearly feigned as it was, in his hobbies. He didn't have anyone else to talk to about these things, and suddenly the prettiest, most popular girl in school was following him to tournaments, cheering him on, and making him the envy of every one of his opponents?

Surely it was too good to be true!

""So that's a dragon, right? That means it breathes fire and stuff, yeah?""

James fought back a groan and lowered his head into his arms as the girl behind him made her way around the table. He made it look like he was tired or something, making sure to make some kind of affirmative noise as to not be rude.

The monster depicted on the card was swimming in the ocean with its multitude of tentacles. There was a bright blue bubble on the corner with the word WATER printed in all capital letters.

She was trying, but she wasn't really.

James raised his head and gave an exasperated look to the girl across the cafeteria table as she settle down.

He was a loser and he knew it, but that didn't mean he wasn't entitled to have pride, did it?

Either directly or indirectly, how often had he or his passions found themselves insulted by this girl? How often had he been made out to be a fool through her attempts to do whatever it was she intended with him?

He had the tact not to have the stereotypical response and tell her off about these things - he was just a teenage boy, after all! - but after *months*...?

Was the attention that wasn't really attention worth it?

What did she even want from him?

Was it a dare from a friend? Did she just think he was cute? Did she intend to ""cure"" him of the hobby once they were dating? Was this some new form of bullying, maybe?

Between her attitude thus far and the shame society had conditioned him to feel about his interests, unable to just enjoy himself in peace, he couldn't imagine her simply liking him for him, but just *not caring about the game*. It was beyond his comprehension, a possibility that would never cross his mind. 

All that crossed his mind, all that ever would cross his mind, was the way she so fervently pursued him but couldn't be bothered to do much as look at a picture she was trying to start a conversation over.

He wasn't an idiot, even if he didn't know he might have been.

""I liked unicorns when I was a kid."" She offered randomly.

James took a deep breath as she finished her thought.

It wasn't that he was offended by unicorns.

It wasn't even that he couldn't see that she *was* trying.

But enough was enough. Surely a guy like him wasn't worth it to *her* pride at this point!

He was going to do it. He had to.

Right now. He had to do it right now, or he never would.

""C-Can we talk?""

***

And there. He'd done it.

Judging by her expression, not to mention the sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach, something told him he had been making a lot of assumptions.

She stood to go, but stopped. He realized too late there was nowhere else to sit and she had barely touched her food.

""Hey, you don't have to... The cafeteria is crowded and I don't... mind..."" The words felt dirty on his mouth after what he'd done, but lying about his feelings, especially now, would be a greater insult to both of them.

She inhaled sharply as she lowered a herself back into her seat. Her gaze was kept downwards.

""It's okay. Just, like...""

James wasn't sure if she was struggling to find the words or if she as struggling not to cry. It made his stomach churn.

""Just let me stay one last time, 'kay?""

It was horribly awkward. Neither of them spoke after, but he didn't have the heart to reject her request.

Sure enough, five minutes to the bell ringing, she got up and left without a word. It was clear that this... whatever it had been between them, it was long over now.

James had gotten what he wanted at long last, but somehow, he felt positively miserable watching her go.

He'd made the right call... hadn't he?

A week had passed since the first encounter. In that time Jess had felt a range of emotions that she'd never experienced before. She'd been hurt and embarrassed, but it didn't take long for the pain to turn into anger. Hot, red seeping anger. The kind of anger that spawns in the pit of your stomach and then churns this way and that, like an angry being thrust into a world where it does not belong. Just *who* does he think he is?

She sat in front of the mirror, looking at herself. Her bright blue eyes were clear and piercing, beneath sat a pair of full, even lips. She had shiny brunette hair that seemed to dance and glisten even when completely motionless. She turned her head this way and that trying to find a flaw, but alas, she was perfect from every angle. 

This only angered her more. *Why* isn't he attracted to me then?
What else can I possibly do?  She thought and thought, racking her brains. If he's not shallow enough to fall for my looks, then that must mean he wants something else from me. 

He's clearly intelligent, she thought. I'll have to try and stimulate him on an intellectual level. That was fine with her. She was clever also, although she felt slightly annoyed. She felt like she shouldn't have to resort to this when she had a face that would make Aphrodite jealous.  

**Monday**

Jess arrived at form and like usual her presence caused the other girls to stop what they were doing and acknowledge her.

'How did you get your hair that straight?'

'Straighteners, Megan' came her curt response. 

Jess was focused on what she had to do later on, and was in no mood for niceties. While the other girls chatted away about this and that, Jess looked around the class. The nerds, the jocks, the footballers, the smokers. All of them seemed so insignificant to her, like they didn't even exist.

The day passed by in a blur, at lunch Jess sat herself in the corner of the hall, so she could see every single person pass through. She waited and waited but he didn't come, just when she thought she'd have to go looking for him she heard the girls suddenly giggling. 

There he was, at the end of the hall. And he was talking to someone. Another girl. Jess felt the room shrinking around her, and she suddenly became aware of whispers from her group of friends.

'You're red again, Jess.'

'Just go over there, he's bound to drop *her* for you, look at the state of her hair!'

'You don't actually like him, do you?'

Jess got up and left. God, she couldn't stand them sometimes. They're like a group of god damned fucking puppies, she thought to herself. Yapping away about anything and everything, following her around, irritating her all day...

Jess stormed over to the table where *he* was sat with his lady friend. She sat down in such a manner that this time her appearance could not go unnoticed.

'Leave,' she hissed at the girl.

'Stay,' came his reply, although he spoke while looking directly at the other girl.

The poor girl looked frightened. She didn't want to ignore a direct order from the most popular girl in school but she'd also just been told to stay by this mysterious boy with the dark eyes.

'I said leave,' said Jess, her voice barely louder than a whisper but cutting so clearly through the air she may as well have been shouting.

'That's no way to talk to my little sister,' came his swift reply.

'It's fine, I'll see you later,' the younger girl said to him, then she stood up, threw her bag over her shoulder and left.

'Oh, I'm s-' Jess was cut off mid speech.

'You know, if you're trying to make me like you you're doing a very bad job.'

'What makes you think I'm trying to do that?'

'Then why have you come over here again?'

'Because I don't understand why you sent me away last time. There's a difference between me wanting you to like me and me not wanting you to dislike me.'

'There is indeed, but tell me, are you as concerned about me as you are with the other 1,500 students?'

*Bastard*, thought Jess.

'You don't seem like the others.'

'How so?'

'Well you're sitting here reading 19th century Russian literature whilst others are concerned about pop culture and taking selfies, so you'll forgive me for being the slightest bit intrigued.'

For the first time, he smiled. It wasn't a dry smirk like last time, it was an actual smile. He's enjoying himself! Jess blushed and fidgeted with her hair. 

From the far corner, Megan and the girls watched intently. They'd never seen Jess this engaged with someone before.

'She's playing with her hair!'

'Do you think she likes him?'

'No, Jess doesn't like boys... she just uses them.'

'Look at her face, she can't keep her eyes off him.'

Back at her table, Jess was still waiting for his response. Once again, he'd paused in thought. She didn't like it when he did this, it felt too much like he was the one in control. But at the same time, she did like it. At least he's actually thinking about what he's going to say, that makes a nice change from the usual idiots I sit with, she thought.

'Well, if you'd like to get to know me, here's not the place-,' just then the bell rang, cutting him off, 'or the time.'

He stood up to his full and considerable height.

'Catch you next time, Jessica.'

Within seconds he'd disappeared into the crowd of students heading to their final lesson. The absolute bastard, she thought. 

And she still didn't know his name.

Good story, all in the right places. It just reminded me of a character approach that I've never seen for many years. That operates not only in puberty terms but also in principles, beliefs, pride, and even existential space. Some kind of idealistic figure that is also completely realistic, because it is of a teenager, a person who, for a while, has the strength or foolishness to try and follow ideals literally. In the rare cases it happens, the ideals are not really shattered - they're instead hammered and wrought into more resilient, sturdy, reality-proof versions of themselves. And those ideals may not be so practical and psychologically sound as ""be yourself"" or ""learn to interact"". They can be more lofty and unyielding, while still leaving a room for a healthy personal development.",AyeBraine

"[WP] A ""popular"" girl falls in love with a ""nerdy"" boy, however he hates her and she spends all her time trying to impress him",pacachii,"Then we sexted again. He continued to ignore me in class. 

Our relationship in print read like steamy erotic fiction, but in person, we were a statistical analysis of awkward teenage interactions. Avoid eye contact? 85% of the time, or until caught by the other person. Who looks away first? Both parties. Coming up with excuses for why I’m blushing from the neck up, 25% convincing. 


A month passed, and while we were still fervently sexting, we were also discussing other parts of our lives, too. I finally decided it was time to address our issue. 


*What if we took our oral repartee to the next level?* I wrote, trying to make it sound like as much of a come on as possible. 


*Oh ho, how do you propose we go about that?* he responded. 

 
*Well, instead of all talk and no action, what if we met up and tried some of the “experiments” we’ve discussed?*


He paused for a long time. I knew something was up. I almost couldn’t bear to look at his response. 
*Linda, as much as I would enjoy that…there’s something I need to tell you. I have a girlfriend. I’ve had a girlfriend that I care about very much for as long as we’ve been…talking.*

 
This wasn’t quite the candid outpouring of emotion I was hoping for. 


*I never meant to lead you on, but I actually thought you knew about my girlfriend. You don’t seem like the kind of girl who would care.*

 
What kind of girl doesn’t care if her lover is in a committed relationship??? Did I really seem that callous to him? Then again, had I really been so stupid that I hadn’t noticed he never showed any kind of affection to me in person? 


He continued, *You’re a fun girl, but you’re graduating this year and you’ll go off to State College. And I’ll be here, with my girlfriend, whom I care about very much. We can definitely still talk…just like we do now. I just felt like you should know.*

 
Why was it that even when he was offending me, I still wanted him? I was having an internal battle between my pride and my desire to be with him. It was my fault for coming on to him. Yet it was his fault for not mentioning his girlfriend sooner. To be fair, most girls would stop once they knew there was another woman in the picture. However, most guys were so busy sucking their girlfriends’ faces it was generally pretty clear whether they were taken or not. Damn you, Tobias, for not being one of those guys!


I considered the possibilities. I weighed the outcomes. I considered walking away from the one person I had ever truly admired and lusted after. 


*You’re right, this is all just a bit of fun.* Who doesn’t like a good time? 


I vowed to learn everything I could about my rival. I would find out her likes and dislikes, how she met Tobias, how long they had been together, and more. I would have to befriend her, and his friends, and infiltrate his group. I will become impossible for him to ignore, unavoidable, but in a pleasant and irresistible way. I would either drive him to love or hate me. It was a risk worth taking, and so help me, I’ll risk it.

"[WP] A ""popular"" girl falls in love with a ""nerdy"" boy, however he hates her and she spends all her time trying to impress him",pacachii,"""You're just not my type"" those words, those goddamn words burned Alexis from the inside out, how could she not be ""his type""!? It was absurd! 

What had begun almost a year prior as a dare by one of her friends to ask a nerd out in public had boiled into a full-blown obsession for her. The first time she asked him out it was in the school cafeteria, like any other boy in the school would she assumed he would burst out with a million cries of ""yes!"" Instead he merely scoffed and answered with a gruff ""fuck off"" he didn't even miss a beat, rejected her outright in a moment, all her insecurities she hid behind makeup, a nice car and a dozen boyfriends was shattered like thin glass in an instant. 

Her obsession began early, the week after his rejection she found his email address and from there was able to find his username on most major websites. She found his Skype username and under the name ""Becca"" had begun chatting to him, to find out what made him tick. 

What she learned was, behind his class daydreaming, his silent hours in the library reading comics and playing videogames, was someone with an intelligence and self awareness she never thought possible. Her friends who spent every weekend drunk, high and getting fucked seemed more fake by the day, she had grown so completely dissilusioned with them as the months dragged on. Before she had 4 ""main"" boyfriends she would be with, all the popular girls did it, and those popular guys, star athletes all did the same with a few girls. Soon each of them began simply dumping her, Kyle dropped her after she chose to watch ""under the red hood"" at home instead of going to Stevie's party, Saun grew cold after she spent her 300 dollars in birthday money on comics instead of sexy clothes and ""party supplies"" Darren stopped returning her calls, because she stopped calling him. She looked back at her life to see how empty it was. She had begun to focus more and more on her studies while her friends continued to party, and yet at school she maintained her air of popularity, shunning the nerds and hanging out only with the ""beautiful people"" yet her nights were consumed with her chatting to him online, she maintained her persona, she liked being Becca more than Alexis, Becca was so pure, accepting of her insecurities, a girl with dreams and ambition, a girl who had passion in her life, a passion for videogames, comics and batman cartoons, but she actually HAD a passion!

As the months went on, more and more people could see Alexis had fallen out with the ""beautiful people"" she had stopped wearing miniskirts and stopped going to the stylist, her friends dressed to the best all the time, yet Alexis had begun coming to school in t-shirts and jeans, her long dyed blonde hair had faded and had begun to return to its natural black... She had changed, changed so much, and it was thanks to him, who she talked to every day under a false name, who had enlightened her to the idea of self-awareness, who had awakened her to the joys of having even a simple passion in life which bought more rewarding feelings than a million parties or a billion boyfriends. 

The day had finally come, she woke up at 4am to get herself looking as good as possible, her black hair was curled to bounce when she walked, all her imperfections were covered with makeup and she dressed in tight fitting woolen clothes, completely covering herself yet showing off her ideal figure, the day had come. 

She found him outside the library ""hey, Michael, could I talk with you a moment?"" She asked, her heart racing and her legs almost shaking ""ugh, oh... Kay?"" Answered Michael nearvously, believing this to be a prank, yet he was curious, he wanted to see how they planned to ""get him"" 

He followed her behind the Drama building, he crossed his arms ""okay Alexis, what is it?"" She took a deep breath, collecting herself ""Michael... I've been hoping to say this for awhile now, and... Please, just hear me out... I like you, I have for a long time, the parties and stuff are all so hollow, you have a passion, you think about your future... And I wanna be a part of that.. So what I'm saying is... Could we... Go out?... Together?"" 

Michael raised an eyebrow, putting his hands on his hips ""well see Alexis... Its just that... I've already kinda got feelings for someone else, and..."" Here it comes ""... And you're really not my type"" 

As Alexis drove home from school she was FUMING! she bashed in her bedroom door, pulled her jewellery off and stormed into the bathroom to wipe the streaming makeup off her face... Her phone vibrated, a Skype message, from Michael to Becca... She opened it, and it read ""Hey Bec, listen I know this is out of the blue but something happened today that's kinda pushed me over the edge and I have to tell you... I've been having feelings for you awhile now-"" she closed the phone and say it down carefully... It made sense now, he only knew her, the REAL her, as Becca, not Alexis, she wiped away her tears and looked her reflection in the eyes. She had to win him, win him from herself, she looked down and closed her eyes ""alright... Square one, let's do this..."" ",Rainman_Slim

"[WP] A ""popular"" girl falls in love with a ""nerdy"" boy, however he hates her and she spends all her time trying to impress him",pacachii,"I looked around me, I was surrounded by filthy hands trying to grope what they can and disgusting mouths hanging open as they lay passed out on whatever they decided was close enough to a bed. I was only 17 but still I felt like I've already seen more of life than I would have wanted to. These parties I told myself I loved to go to just left me with a bitter after taste and a sour stomach. These people I used to call my friends just seemed empty.

 Michelle had promised me a spot in her bed but I realized I would have to spend the night cuddled up next to a pimpled jock after I saw Dennis and her go into her room together. I looked over my selection of beef pillows I could possibly rest my head on, most of them drooling and trying not to throw up in their sleep. The outside didn't seem all that frightening anymore and so I went outside. The walk home wouldn't be too far. I had walked home from Michelle several times in the past, never wearing 10 cm heels though. 

 It was eerily quiet for a Saturday night. The moon had that beautiful look that it only gets when you're walking home alone and the stray cats seemed to think I was one of them as I walked past the alleys. I finally reached my neighborhood. I could see my house down the street, no light shining in the windows. The boy next door was standing on the driveway to his house, looking up to the sky. I knew his name. Pete Somethingson. I never bother with last names. I was the only kid on this street until he came along. It was about three years ago. 

-Hi, I said and walked towards him. He turned his gaze to me, away from the sky, and I think he could hear my gasp. This was the first time I saw his cold blue eyes, even in the dark and even though his thick dark curls hung over his face. I pulled his hair to the back of his ear. 

-Hello, he responded, uninterested. 

-What are you looking at? I asked, my drunken tongue stumbling on the words a bit. 

-Meteor shower. You can't really see much though. Because of the streetlights. 

-Oh, is it uh, fun? Or I mean, is it interesting? I said and took a crooked step in his direction. 

-Like I said, you can't really see much. I think I'll go inside, he said and abruptly turned his back to me. The door slammed before I even had a chance to tell him good night. 
 

I saw him in school the Monday that followed. I watched him through behind the books in the library. Many of the other students gave me looks, as if they were wondering what I was doing there. Maybe they were frightened. Why would one of the most popular girls in school hang around among the nerds if not to pull some sort of prank. But I couldn't stay away. I dreamed about his eyes all weekend. Those hungover days where you spend most of the time slipping in and out of naps, not sure what is real and what is yet another dream. His face was on repeat in my mind that hungover day. I couldn't stop wondering where is mind was at. Why wasn't he yearning to talk to me? Why did he spend all his time reading those books? Why didn't he seem to want friends? 

-Well, hello again, I said and plopped down in the seat opposite to him. I pulled out one of my text books even though I had no idea if we were actually using it in a class. 

-Hi, he said, not lifting his eyes from his book. 

-Dave? Richardsson asked me to give this to you, a pimpled kid said and handed Pete an envelope. 

-Dave? Who's Dave? I asked. 

-We've been neighbors for the last three years, don't you even know my name? Dave said and stood up. I felt my cheeks burn and I could feel the eyes of everyone on me. 


 I waited for him by his locker, he looked annoyed when he saw me waiting for him. 
-Wait, Dave, I'm sorry. 

-Sorry? For what?
 
-For not knowing your name, I said, my voice sounding unsure. 

-Why have you just now started to talk to me? He closed his locker and leaned back, crossing his arms over his chest. 

-Well, I uh, when I saw you the other day I realized I hadn't talked to you and like you said, we've been neighbors for three years now. I guess it's about time. Don't you? 

-It's about time we talked? That's your answer? His eyebrows were raised and he leaned forward. 

-Well, yeah. Don't you think so? My voice sounded uneven. I felt like I should have prepared something to say. 

-How can you just pretend like nothing has happened? Do you just want be to forget that you and your gang bullied me so much that I had to leave the state? I had to move back with my horrible mother just to get away from you. After a year of living with her I realized that I wouldn't let you or your friends ruin my life. I would never be able to look at myself in the mirror if I let you do that to me. I was very surprised when you didn't recognize me when I moved back though. But I guess getting rid of my glasses and a new haircut is enough for someone as self absorbed as you. 
 He pulled up his backpack from the floor and left before I could say a word.

My maths teacher was punishing me. It was the only explanation. *When I asked Clarity what the square root of 9 was and she answered with ‘numbers have roots?’ I felt my IQ drop by five points.*

However, the test was due tomorrow and therefore this meeting was necessary. 

“Look at all these big books,” Clarity said as she gazed around the school library in amazement. 

I ignored her and focused on drawing the angles for our triangle, accurately. Once done I passed her the page. “You’ll have to label the different sections. I’ll get started on the next one.” 

She nodded and got to work.  “You know, a library like this reminds me of Harry Potter,” she said. 

I paused. She was bluffing. “You like Harry potter?” 

Clarity gave a rosy smile. “I love it. Did you know that Harry potter and JK share the same birthday?

I perked up. “Yeah. Did you know that I have a Harry Potter section in my room?”

“With a poster of Harry on his Nimbus 2000?”

“Wait. How did you know that?” I asked. 

“Err. . . Look don’t worry about that, I brought you these.” She pulled out a big box from her bag and placed it on the table. The box was filled with Harry Potter themed cookies. “They’re gluten free, just how you like them.”

“How’d you know I l- Ooooh, a Dobbie cookie. Why are his eyes closed?” “Spoiler alert.” 

We chuckled.

 Maybe she wasn’t so bad after all. While chomping down a cookie she passed me the maths project. I skimmed over the first label, ‘Hi-Potter-News’. My first reaction was to flip out but I found myself smiling instead. 

They say hate and love are very similar emotions. And it was at that moment I knew this was meant to be.

"[WP] A male-to-female transgender discovers the dark, sinister reason of why women leave their bobby pins in seemingly random places all over the house.",rick2882,"&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;There was an empty plastic bowl and a toddler's training spoon on the kitchen table. She snatched a generic box of breakfast cereal off the counter and shook it a few times to guestimate how much cereal was left. With both hands gripped tightly around the box, she bit her bottom lip. Flashbacks of happy moments in her life cycled behind her eyes like a child's stereoscope, and there was an uncomfortable calmness that blanketed the room. A feeling of love, shame and despair tangled in a mess of shattered memories. This wasn't her fault, and she knew it wasn't her fault, but she couldn't help but blame herself for everything that's happened.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;She set the box on the table and projected her voice down the hall of the one story house, ""Love, where's Jackson?""  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Her wife yelled from down the hall, ""We're getting ready together in the bathroom. We'll be out in a minute.""  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;She swallowed what felt like a box of rocks and mustered the most cheerful tone she could conjure, ""Take your time. Breakfast is on the table.""  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Friday's became a pattern for her. She woke up, got ready, and came home to her family for monitored visitation time with her son. This wasn't by choice, of course. Her wife and inlaws suggested time apart. *'Think of the baby'* they said. She obliged. Anything to keep things amicable. She loved her wife and their baby boy. They meant the world to her, and she did anything to make them happy. So she did whatever she could in hopes of salvaging whatever was left of their dying, or already dead relationship.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The blissful sounds of her son cooing, and the laughter of her wife made her smile. She took a step forward in the direction of the hallway, but immediately took a step back. She didn't want to overstep her boundaries. This wasn't just tough for her, but also tough on her wife, her family, and everyone who once knew her as *him*.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;She took in a deep breath, and went to the fridge for milk. Something caught her attention. Her eyes glanced down at a bobby pin on the checkered linoleum floor of the kitchen. There was another one. And another one. And another one. Bobby pins aligned like a breadcrumb trail that lead to a drawer on the far end of the kitchen counter.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;One by one, she picked up each pin, wondering why there was a trail of bobby pins in the kitchen. She opened the drawer and pulled out a neatly folded manilla envelope.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""Say good morning, sweetie! Can you say *'good morning'*?""  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The baby boy giggled and shrieked with happiness.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;She turned around and saw her wife standing on the opposite side of the kitchen with their son in her arms.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""You look beautiful,"" she said.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""Mhm,"" her wife replied, avoiding all eye contact.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;She sat the handful of bobby pins and envelope on the counter.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""What's with the pins and the envelope?"" she asked.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Her wife snuggled up to their son, rubbing her nose against his cheek. ""The pins are to remind you that you'll never be a real woman""—

"[WP] A male-to-female transgender discovers the dark, sinister reason of why women leave their bobby pins in seemingly random places all over the house.",rick2882,"I quietly put the cellphone back on the charging platform, electing to ignore the contents of the phone call that had just occurred. Life was hard enough as is without Marshall deciding his personal opinions on how people should act needed to be followed by everyone. I had never even known him before I began my transition, a friend of my uncle's or something, and yet the second my extended family had been told, it felt like he had just starting hounding me.

I collapsed onto the couch with a bag of M&amp;Ms, slowly inhaling the small chocolate pieces while watching reruns of Dr. Who. I had nothing to do that day, the worst type of days. Sad and scary thoughts snuck into my mind when there was nothing to do. I wanted to ask Paul to come over, but he was working until late tonight. I was alone.

A bump upstairs caught my attention, the television fading into the background as I listened intently for unknown and unwanted sounds. I had luckily never had to experience any sort of break-in growing up, but the sounds immediately sent my mind into overdrive. I grabbed my phone and a baseball bat, hitting record on the Camera app.

I slowly inched upstairs, heart beating far too fast in my throat. At the top of the stairs, I stuck the phone slightly out, the screen showing what my eyes couldn't. There didn't appear to be anything out of the ordinary. I stood at the top of the stairs, leaning the phone up against a bunch of hygiene and self-care items to record as much of the doors as possible. I slowly pushed open each of the doors, one by one, each of them responding with silence. 

Only one door remained, the office. I hadn't had to use that in a while, so there were a few full laundry baskets piled up near it. After clearing those out, I pushed the door open. Silence. 

Silence, at least for a few seconds. That's when the demon poked his head out. Every hair on my body stood up straight. I was frozen with fear. Something in the back of my mind was saying something about cameras and evidence, but there was only me and the impish evil gnome with wings slowly making its way out of the office. 

I didn't manage to grab control of my senses, but my feet did decide to slowly back away, before bumping me up into the wall next to the stairs. The demon followed my lead, advancing as much as I backed up, before closing in once I was back against the wall. Then, it stopped.

It turned its head to the side, hissing at my phone. I instinctively grabbed my phone, not concerned much anymore about what it was recording. Still, it hissed in the same direction.

At this point, I had some control over my actions, and in the shocked and confused state I was, decided that the best course of action was to begin tossing the various items in the pile at the little creature. Conditioner, hairspray, sunscreen, a shaver, some makeup and nail polish, all bounced off with no effect. But when I threw the little container of bobby pins, it let out the worst bloodcurdling scream I had ever heard, before just… poofing into non-existent. 

The next thing I remembered was being in the hospital, a nurse writing something in a sheet and dear old Mrs. Jakobson sitting in a chair nearby. After some more generic questions, I was asked to explain from my perspective what happened.

I tried to be as vague as possible. Being in my position doesn't net you a whole lot of support, and if I mentioned seeing flying demons disappearing when hit by bobby pins, I'd probably be put into a padded room. 

The nurse and Mrs. Jakobson smiled at each other.

""Oh, sweetie. I'm sorry you had to find out like that, normally someone tells you early in the transition period, before the nasties add you to the list.""

I stared at Mrs. Jakobson, slack-jawed. I wasn't crazy?

The nurse piped up. ""For some reason, bobby pins aren't something the nasties like at all. Many of us leave them around in any room with a window, or pipes, or anything a nasty can conceivably just 'appear' in. Nobody quite knows why, but there's been a lot of tests, none of which agree with any of the others. Just leave a bunch of them in any room of yours, and you should be good. They're a lot less common in public areas, so don't worry about that.""

I nodded, numbly. As the nurse helped me close up the visit so I could leave, a twinge of humor slipped in. The humans don't think I'm female, but the 'demons' do. Which one was which?

[WP] Tell me a story that will make me afraid of the light.,ryry1237,"Light makes them active. 

Call them zombies. Call them ghouls. Call them revenants. The name doesn't matter. They will all do the same thing if they catch you. Tear you apart and eat you. And if they don't finish you? If you somehow get away after they have bitten you? You will get a high fever. Your brain will boil. You will drop dead. And when the sun rises, so will you as one of them. 

You will only move when there is a light. Doesn't matter if it is from the glare of the sun or the glow of a T.V.. A simple flame from a lit match will make you rush like a moth. 

I've seen this happen, myself. 

There was a camp of us, survivors. Six in total. Huddled in this warehouse. Living like blind moles. Feeling our way through the world in complete darkness. This one woman, she couldn't take it anymore. She would cry so much. Day after day. And none of us could even see the pain in her face to give her sympathy. One night, while we were pressed against the darkest corners, we heard her shuffled footsteps echoing away from us. Then nothing. She had stopped. The next thing we heard was the scratch of a match against the side of a matchbox. The spark came and then the tiny flame. We shielded our eyes out of pain for a moment only to look back and see them. The monsters. Eight of them had been with us all along. The pitch black had kept them at bay. But with the flame, they came alive. One howled. Not like a dog's howl. More like a wail of a banshee. The others started to snarled. The rest of us survivors were still safe in the shadows but we could see them. The details of their unnerving faces. The foam dripping from their mouths. The yellow of their turned eyes. The sallow gray of their skin. Like rabid animals. 

The woman with the match waved her arm. ""Come on! Kill me!""

They came. Running and hitting her like starving hyenas, knocking her down. She didn't scream but dropped her match. It rolled away from her but was still lit. We watched as the bodies piled on top of her. Her throat was the first thing they ripped out with their teeth. I don't know if she would have screamed anyway if she could. She wanted this. Two them grabbed an arm and pulled. The limbs came out of their sockets. Her clothing was torn to make a clear path to her torso. Mouths dove at her belly and came up with chunks of meat in them. Sloppy sounds of eating bounced off the metal walls of the warehouse. 

Then the match went out plunging everything in black.

Instantaneous silence came next. Like we were watching a movie and someone had pulled the plug. 

The woman was still there. They were still there. But with no light, they had simply switched off. 

Someone grabbed me. ""We have to go. Now. This place isn't safe anymore.""

""Agreed."" I felt the space around me and grabbed someone's shirt. I knew everyone was doing the same with each other. We had made a human chain. 

We moved hugging along the wall until someone found the door. We opened it. All of us were grateful to have a thick cloudy night sky that greeted us in darkness equal to the one we were leaving. 

That was three days ago. Now we are huddled up in a church attic. We have covered up the single stained glass window with duct tape and boxes. We sleep during the day and at night, like rats, we roam the city looking for food. I have no idea how long we can keep this up. How long before another person snaps. This time starting a fire that brings the things that lurk in the light to damn us all.

Rich lays into the couch, and closes his eyes, exhaling deep. ""Sam, it told all of us we're going to die tonight. Thing's busted.""

Why do you and Lizzy and Kaitlin and Kess and every other goddamned person we know get to die together and I get singled out?"" Sam says, throwing his right hand into the air, holding the box under his left arm. He slumps into a stained Ikea recliner, and grasps the box in both hands, staring into the face of its death clock. ""What, am I not cool enough to die with you guys?"" Sam smacks the side of the black box, then reinserts his finger into the slot on the top.

The box beeps before flashing a date.

""Better?""

""Nope, I'm still at the die alone party.""

Kess walks into the room and sits in the beat-up La-Z-Boy next to the couch currently occupied by Rich. He takes a sip from his PBR. ""What's going on guys?""

""Sam's not going to die with us,"" Rich says, propping his feet on the particle board coffee table in front of him.

Kess raises his PBR. ""Congrats."" He takes a sip, then rests the can in his lap.

""Don't 'congrats' me."" He looks up from the box to see Kess, then stares back down at his death date. ""I wanna die with the rest of you guys. It'd be cool. Instead I gotta wait around here and die alone like a loser.""

Kess takes another drink. He shakes the can, then crushes in his grip. ""If you've gotta wait around anyway,"" he says while tossing the empty at Sam, ""think you could get me another?""

Sam lifts the box, blocking the can, then tosses it into an unoccupied section of the couch. ""Whatever."" Sam shuffles into the kitchen.

The refrigerator light yellows his shirt as he reaches inside for a can of PBR, then his entire body is bathed in sterile white for an instant. Sam looks up, peering through a window above the sink. A mushroom cloud rises in the distance. ""Guys! It was broken! I'm gonna die with--""

I looked around at my fellow students. Almost everyone here had a date of death set as 12/31/16. My brother and I were among those who didn't. From what I was told the two of us, along with 18 or 19 other people who had other dates were going to be sent to a base in Texas that was underground and would keep us safe. I wondered why that was because according to the scientists that had built the device you would die on your date no matter what. Nothing you or anyone else did could either prolong or shorten your life. You could change how the rest of your days were spent in light of your date but you couldn't change how much time you were going to spend on this earth. I was thinking about all of this when I suddenly realized I was going to be late for class. I broke into a run and made it to my study hall just as the first bell rang.


  It was December 26th 2016 and me and my 8 year old brother were being herded into a large underground bunker that had been built quickly at the news of who all was going to live but that had been well constructed. everyone had their own bedrooms and bathrooms. The other areas were communal but gigantic and built to hold all twenty of us at one time comfortably if need be.",Mollyu
"[WP]Scientists invent a device that can determine the date of people's death. Almost everyone's date is December 31, 2016.",trjones1,"The private jet to Washington DC wasn't roomy enough. Ben paced up and down the aisle, knowing damn well what Pascal was like - and he was utterly powerless to do anything at the moment. 

He had asked Pascal once. It was a wintry night then, too cold for ice, and Pascal was chattering away inside. In between gulps of hot chocolate he had told Ben how much his life had been changed by information. Ben listened, of course - or at least he pretended to, and then stalked away. Employee engagement was a core tenet of the company.

The plane was still a few minutes from touchdown. It couldn't come soon enough, Ben thought. The one time he had taken his best worker to DC for a cybersecurity convention Pascal had very quickly gotten lost in the audience. At the time Ben thought it little more than a worrying sign - but now he was quickly beginning to realise its importance.

*You know who I am. You know what I like. Come find me.*

He knew who Pascal was, alright. Some reactionary that never seemed to grow up or grow out of his beliefs. And a dangerous belief - yes, *dangerous* - that all information should be free and open to the world. Like the Panama Papers earlier in the year. Ben would not be surprised if that was his doing too. In hindsight it looked like an amazing practice run for the real thing.

What could bring about the end of the world so quickly? Ben's mind played with the possibilities. A virus was one idea, but there was no way something like that could have spread to kill so many people so quickly. An asteroid? But NASA had detected nothing. Could be a gamma-ray burst, something going wrong with physics itself - but Ben dismissed them all. There was only one option left.

Nuclear war. Ben shuddered. He remembered the Cold War very well. Pascal would have loved this, his former boss, squirming in his private jet somewhere over the United States. To initiate nuclear war it would not take much. Ben knew how close they had come during the Cold War - twice - and in both cases it was as much a lack of information as anything else. Except that this time would be different. No, this time the threat probably came from too *much* information-

Ben's pencil played around with the date. 31122016. It seemed an utterly unremarkable date, other than the fact that it was the very last date at the end of the year. It didn't sound like any mathematical constant in existence - and Pascal had *loved* putting those Easter eggs into his work. And as the plane banked slowly over the icy mass that was the Potomac, he realised that there was nothing inherently special about the number, no secret hidden in its strange arrangements. It had been completely arbitrary.

*It had been completely arbitrary.*

In a flash Ben knew. 

Pascal never said anything about the *numbers* themselves meaning anything. He had mentioned the *date*. And it had been completely random. Pascal had been able to set the date for the world's destruction entirely of his own choosing.

The soft thump of tarmac startled Ben from his thinking. They were here, and it was a frosty morning in Washington DC. December 27, 2016 - he had less than four days to find Pascal and see what he really wanted.

---

He had first taken Pascal to see the Lincoln memorial. The silent reflecting pool was almost black in the rising sun. There were few people out and about post-Christmas week. Ben walked up the steps and into the bloated Greek temple, all the way to where Lincoln was sitting, watching impassively. He briefly wondered how Lincoln must feel looking out at the state of the nation. He knew for sure that Pascal had admired Lincoln, or at least the idea of Lincoln - the one man who was strong enough to stand up for his beliefs. Except Lincoln had been shot for his beliefs, of course. Ben would very much have preferred to stay alive.

And then at the foot of the chair he saw a small piece of paper peek out of the corner.

Ben snatched at the scrap. One half was already yellowed, exposed to the elements. But there was writing inside. In blue ink, so old as to sink into the paper, Ben read the note.

""Well done! You've managed to locate where I am. Did you have to guess? How did it feel like, not having enough information?""

Ben knew how it felt alright. It felt like complete crap. Pascal was probably loving every second of it, having the power to turn the tables on his former boss, knowing when exactly everyone would die. And briefly Ben's mind flashed back to a joke he had once made, something everyone else but Pascal would have forgotten -

""I can see when you will die.""

Well, it was no joke now. Pascal had all the cards. Ben kept reading the note.

""I don't know if you realise this, but I'm probably somewhere in this building, and I'm waiting.""

Ben jumped as if he had been touched. A quick glance around revealed an empty hall. There was no-one there - and Ben thought Pascal would never had made it so obvious where he was. He liked to play games. What could Pascal possibly have that could destroy the world so quickly and reliably?

This time, in the silent halls, the answer came quickly. The nuclear codes. Pascal knew - not just the activation codes, but probably almost everything else about the world's governments. All he had to do was swap the codes, trip everyone up in a nuclear wiretrap - and there were already plenty of people who would want to destroy the world's governments. 

No, he would not swap the codes. He would make them all *public.*

Ben shuddered again. Stuffing the note back into the pocket, he looked up again. The memorial was no fuller than before. But then Ben saw Pascal.

And Pascal was smiling.",KCcracker

Right after shock was the denial. How could a device determine the date someone could die anyway? And 97%? That had to be some sort of anomaly, right?

Ben surmised as much from the silent clicking.

""Date?"" he asked.

Silence. The LED screen at the top of the wall blinked 31/12/16. Without looking Ben sighed. ""It's still the same, right?""

As one they nodded.

Ben sighed and crumpled back into his chair. The device had been spot-on with everything so far. Assassinations, celebrity deaths, you name it, they told it. Even the mundane deaths like a drive-by shooting had been predicted down to the microsecond the heart stopped beating. It had been the crown jewel in Google's system - the ability to predict who would die when was the greatest collection of knowledge since the Library of Alexandria three millennia ago, and more importantly they had beaten the other tech companies to the punch. It was also highly, highly secret. And if anyone even so much as talked about their position at Google with the outside world they'd die of natural causes the next day.

Well...

That wasn't strictly true, Ben thought as he walked up and down, pacing past the terrified scientists. There was *one* person whose death the device had not predicted yet. Not even a false prediction - not like this one surely must be - but no prediction at all. The LED screens that were supposed to tell the time simply hit a blank. It was almost as if the person had never existed, or had already died.

And he had worked at Google before, Ben thought. *Worked.*

Behind him the scientists slowly settled into normalcy - the kind of normalcy that came from not knowing what to do. Ben scrolled through his memory - what was his name?

Pascal. Pascal Lidl. Aged twenty one. Child prodigy as well, though oddly enough no university or government anywhere in the world had a record of this person. Ben himself was pushing fifty. He was old enough to be the kid's father, just about. And if he racked his mind real hard and ignored the mistaken calculations, he could just about picture Pascal - wide blue eyes, big round face, the kind of person that just made you want to hug him when you saw him.

Except that Pascal was no cuddly bear. He had been destructive to the project from the get-go. When Ben first conceived of the idea for the death predictor, Pascal was the only one against it. When Brookhaven National Labs were designing the chip to go into the computer, Pascal was the one who broke in and stole it. Only Ben knew, of course - and this last act had forced him to intervene and fire the eccentric genius. And of course, when someone got fired from this project, they didn't just get fired - their lives as they knew it were over.

Ben remembered the car crash well. He had said all the proper things, wondered how it was that someone so young could have taken his own life in so tragic a manner. He never saw the body. And the more Ben looked at the story the dodgier it sounded.

He had always believed Pascal was alive, that somehow his plan to kill him off had not succeeded. Now was the time to put it to the test. Quickly, Ben reached for his phone, to where the quickdial still sat waiting. There was a voice message.

Ben recognised that number. His hands shook. Slowly, he pressed the button on the screen, hit play.

""You have *one* new message. Press 1 to listen, or press 2 to call back.""

Ben pressed a button, and the phone spoke.

""Hello, Ben,"" Pascal said. ""It's good to see you again. I'll bet you were wondering why your machine doesn't work? I'll tell you what: it is working perfectly. There will be an apocalypse on December the 31st, 2016 - exactly as you are predicting. I set the date. It is a clue. You know who I am and what I like.""

The voice dropped to a whisper. Ben strained in, listening like the world was on his shoulders. The phone spoke again.

""Come find me.""",KCcracker

I didn't know if I should have screamed, ran the numbers again, or what. I kept scrolling, scrolling, scrolling. I kept seeing it: 2016-12-31. ""This isn't possible,"" I thought. I refreshed. The same thing. I continued scrolling. Nothing changed. My co-workers, my friends, my family, it's all the same. I leaned back into my chair and covered my face with my hands. Moist hands met sweaty face. I continued to scroll, all of them were the same. A thought entered my head. I didn't know what to do, and I wasn't gonna do it myself. I grabbed my phone and called Arin, my best friend and co worker. I explained everything. ""What are we going to do? All of these years we spent on this, and the math can't be wrong, it guessed past deaths."" Arin said, still half asleep due to me waking him up in the middle of the night. I clicked on the ""Already dead"" tab and clicked back. ""Yeah, you're right."" I exhaled. ""Well what are we gonna do? We can't release it to the public."" Arin said, as if he thought I had a plan.

""Dude your date, it's changed to today,"" I spoke with higher volume. ""Are you f***ing kidding?"" The number changed back to 2016-12-31. 
""Okay now it's changed back."" I said. 
""F**ck! What are we going to do? Have you looked at your date yet?"" ""No, I haven't."" I replied. I scrolled down, expecting the same numbers. My eyes widened as I saw the date 2017-1-1 next to my name.

That we couldn't find the date of our own demise. But some scientists out in the middle of Nowheresville Kansas did it. It was amazing at first we could find out our death dates. People with illnesses and such got the technology first, but then it slowly leaked into the public. At that point everyone posted their's on social media. Crime began to rise because what was there for them to truly fear. But then someone saw a pattern, and it was terrifying. Almost everyone was set to die on the 31st of December this year. I laughed to myself, because I knew what was going to happen. I had been following up on a man who went by the alias Will T. Flemsom. It was strange at first some random person had been buying up old missile silos and hiring astronautical engineers. Of course none of this matters anymore. Here I am on space ship as extra luggage waiting. It was known to me and a few others what was going to happen. Will is planing on starting a nuclear war, and him and some others will hide out in space until it's all over. But he had been to dumb to realize that his buying habits would go past me.

I came out of my daze and looked over to at Marcus, my lab assistant. I don't know how long we had been sitting in silence. Years and years of work on the invention had led to this horrific, inescapable conclusion. That almost every in the world would perish on December 31st, 2016. I stared back down at the sleek device in my hand, turning it over and over.
 

“Dr. Armitage? Did you hear what I said? We have tell the world.” 
 

We started creating the prototype three years ago on a beautiful crisp April morning. Now it was few minutes to midnight on the 30th of May and the world had but seven months to live. I was tired and hungry and part of me wished I would just break down and cry and get it over with. 
 

“It wouldn’t change a thing.” 
 

Marcus rose up from his terminal, crossing over towards me. 
 

“People have a right to know.” 
 

“The end is inevitable. Knowing about it won’t change that. It would only cause, fear, suffering, panic-”
 

“You don’t get to choose for everyone.”
 

Marcus was almost upon me. His voice was cracking, he was agitated. Angry. I could tell he somehow blamed me- blamed himself- for all of this. He held out his hand, staring down at where I sat by the banks of silent computer screens. 

“Give me the device, Dr. Armitage.” 
 

“I can’t do that.” My voice was quiet, small. I stared down at the device again. 
 

“This is the last time I’ll ask. Give me the device or…”
 

“Or what? You’ll make me?” 
 

He looked away for a moment, pained. Then he nodded, his eyes falling on me again. A desperate determination behind them. He reached for the device. Perhaps he thought he could take from me. That he could warn the world. That he could somehow change things. 
 

I knew he couldn’t. Because I had pointed it towards him as he sat there. And I had seen what it said. And despite his best intentions, despite everything, I knew that Marcus Lambert, my friend and colleague, would die on May 30th 2016. 
 

He grabbed the device but I wouldn’t let go. The clock ticked on, one minute to midnight. I stared into his eyes, keeping my grip firm, and I waited to see what would happen.

There was a spattering of laughter as they looked down at the ipad that had made the noise.

“Who set that?” the professor asked, looking around at her grad students. The snickering intensified, but no one copped to it.

“Alright, what does it say?” she sighed.

“December 31st, 2016,” the student holding the device dutifully read out. She smirked at her coworker in front of her, “Sounds like someone’s going to party a little too hard for new years!”

“Hey! If I die partying, it’s gonna be after midnight,” Jordan stated, pulling the sensor off his index finger to peel the cap from his head, “Try it yourself.”

“Fine,” Samantha said, and smoothed down her hair before pulling the cap over her head. After the fingertip sensor was on, the professor took the tablet and turned the device on.

RIBBIT!

Her students laughed again. Beth ignored it this time.

“December 31st, 2016,” she read out, and sighed. “I don’t suppose you plan to go to the same party on new years?”

“How am I supposed to know?” Samantha asked, “That’s not for months.” Her eyes widened slightly, “Last year we rode together.”

“You’re not actually worried, are you?” Jordan asked, “Last time it said I was going to die in 1989,” he pointed out, “I was born in 92.”

“You’re right,” Samantha said, “At least it’s on the right track.” She looked at the third grad student, 

“Scan Eli, he doesn’t party. He doesn’t even celebrate the same new years!”

Eli shrugged and stepped forward for the sensors. “I’ll be on a cruise for new years.”

AWOOOGA!

“Same thing,” Beth sighed, “We’ve got a whole crop of undergrads coming in to get scanned tomorrow. I don’t want to waste it.”

“Maybe it’s the programming. If it thinks the end of the year is the last day, anything after that could read the same,” Eli pointed out.

“Or the frequency needed is different on humans than the rats?” Samantha asked.

“Don’t go messing with the frequency, all the calculations said it should be the same,” Beth said, 
“We’ll revisit it if we can’t find a bug in the code. And fix the sound effect before the subjects get here tomorrow.”


By the next day, they had changed nothing. A little over thirty undergrads came in and were scanned one after the other after the other, with a nice professional ‘ding’ announcing their results were ready. But unlike their casual tests, they couldn’t check the results until the whole lot had been scanned, in order to maintain the anonymity of the results.

“I’m starting to hate that ‘ding’,” Beth complained about halfway through, “We’re probably wasting our time.”

Finally, Eli loaded up the results in a spreadsheet. He scanned down the prediction column and groaned. “It’s all the same.”

“Wait!” Samantha barked, “Scroll up again?”

“July 4th, 2016,” Beth read. “Maybe that one’s right! A firework accident, maybe?”

“Bullet to the head!,” Samantha said brightly, “Back home people are always shooting guns into the air to celebrate. Now and then it kills someone.”

“It probably is what you thought, Eli,” Beth said, “Anything after December 31st gets grouped in as that.”

“I’ll just have to dig a little more for the bug,” Eli said. He paused his scrolling. “Wait.”

“Oh shit.” The four stared at the newest blip in the data. It was the second to last reading: January 18th, 2017.

“At least we know 2017 is happening,” Jordan said darkly. The silence stretched out until Beth broke it.

“Eli, you look for that bug. Jordan, Sam, we’re going to get more subjects. Print more consent slips until the printer runs out of paper.”


A week later, Beth came in late, carrying reams of printer paper.

“Why are we even bothering with the consent slips anymore?” Samantha asked, “We’ve broken procedure so many times to get people in. Or we could at least update them to reflect that we’re bribing people.”

“It’s just donuts,” Jordan said.

“Still! We’re doing it because we know more people will participate that way. We should at least put it in the consent slips.”

“We’re not wasting time updating the slips,” Beth said, “But we are going to keep using them. We need plausible deniability if we want to present our results.”

“If?” Samantha asked. “We’re not going to tell people what’s happening?”

“If we can figure out something’s even happening,” Beth said, “Do you want this on our careers if our system is just malfunctioning?”

“But the future isn’t set in stone,” Samantha argued, “If people know… something can stop it. Eli’s number changed!”

Beth looked at Eli, then all three of them. “You didn’t think to tell me that?” she asked.

“It happened yesterday,” Eli said, “We didn’t get the chance yet.”

“What changed?” Beth asked, “What are you doing differently?”

“I convinced my parents to cancel the cruise. We’re going to visit my uncle instead.” He hesitated, “He served in the IDF, came back paranoid. His place is like a bunker.”

“What’s your number now?” Beth asked.

“July. July 2017,” Eli said.",donttouchtheduck

&gt;It’s a cold winters night in Seattle, she approaches the beat down 7/11 with her overconfident stride, she knew that minutes later they would all be at her feet.

Quick talk about opening lines. You want them to be approachable to the user, but also to have gravitas to pull the reader into a story. Your opening line has way too much in it though, we have the setting (Seattle and cold), the action (approaching a 7/11), the character (overconfident stride), and backup character details (all be at her feet). Query, does it matter at all that the story takes place in Seattle or that this is a 7/11? Those seems odd specifics that don't really play into the story. Also, you indicate overconfidence, but don't use that later in the story, she seems to have the appropriate level of confidence considering ho the story ends. Also, slightly odd that you talk about people being at her feet, but when that happens in the story with the clerk she seems a bit taken aback which is a little confusing between her expectation and reality, which seemed to meet her expectation. I think that part of that is that your going to far with this opening line. Lets take this in parts.

&gt;It’s a cold winters night in Seattle

Cold Winter's night is probably accurate, but uninspired in terms of prose. It's factual, but doesn't impart feeling. Remember that for most readers who haven't been to Seattle on a cold winter's night this doesn't mean much. The person who has lived in southern California all their life has little conception of a cold winter's night in Seattle. Try to be a bit more effusive. ""The cold alone chilled through flesh and bone, but the worst of it was the wind that howled through the skyscrapers and across the busy streets to grab and rend warmth away. Another cold Seattle night.

&gt;she approaches the beat down 7/11 with her overconfident stride

Try, ""The neon '7' and '11' blazes across the street, promising a brief respite from the cold to those wandering vagrants of the city. The store a beacon of the degradation of capitalism shone, it's dilapidated windows and counters, a beacon for the poor unfortunate souls trapped on the streets this night."" We drop the overconfident and explain the 7/11 using the neon light, which seems more apropos then just stating it's a 7/11. Also we work in some political motivations here which you may or may not like, but feel free to change them to anything else, the point is to get some motivations in here, because on it's own robbing a 7/11 seems pretty pointless. Lastly we talk in visceral terms about the state of the 7/11 which is nice to reinforce its dilapidation.

&gt;she knew that minutes later they would all be at her feet.

Try ""Those poor souls within would be but slaves, groveling at her feet within minutes of her entrance, desperate at her appearance to be lifted up and away from the poverty of the night. Drinking to mush to explain fully right now, but the main thrust is that this gives more explanation for the grovelling at her feet, that she is like an angel of the night taking these poverty stricken souls away with her.

2

&gt;She takes her shiny Desert Eagle out

This is a great moment, but is let down by some basic vocabulary. Try something like, ""A sparkle in moonlight as the silver grip is pulled from its holster, the gun, heavy by too far in mere mortals hands holds steady in hers and bears the mark of death along its side, Desert Eagle .50.

&gt;sights and calmly requests “Cash in the bag. Thank you” then winks.

I like this line, and the wink at the end, good character moment.

4

&gt;its said that no man could resist her once she really tries.

""Its said"" is sort of a cop out line at this point. Push deeper, like, ""In all the jobs in all the cities she's ever pulled no man has ever been able to resist her voice and that soft, loving wink."" I mean who is the 'its' in 'its said'

&gt;no different, though something was different

You can't sat that the cashier was no different but something was different about him. I get the intent, but the vocabulary is letting you down here. Try, "" He went to the cash register like all the rest in all the seedy places before, but something wasn't quite right, something was different about this man, this boy, something that left her speechless."" I know that I incorporated the next sentence here, but I think it works well here.

6

&gt;to her, it felt so right.

Again, reach your imagination and vocabulary, ""it felt so right"" is stale, it doesn't connect very effectively with readers (in my opinion). Try ""...yet her eyes were enwrapped by this man, this boy, a clerk in a store in an inconsequential part of an inconsequential city, bluer than the oceans and deeper than her waking dreams.""

7

&gt;Jordan who just now realized what she had said jumped to his senses

This is true, but fails to grab the imagination for the scene that just happened. This is a pivotal moment, a moment when the clerk is abandoning his former life for the prospect of more. It needs to hold more weight. Try, ""There was a moment in Jordan's mind where her words circled in and endless loop before swirling into an abyss of emotion. Those words pulled at him and begged him to follow, abandoning whatever sedentary life he lived to shine at her side and live as something more than his name tag belied.

8

&gt;expectantly, they were waiting just for him, or so it seemed.

A good line, though I'd drop the ""or so it seemed."" - it hits harder without that cushion.


I only did the first paragraph, sorry, but vodka calls to me and any advice past this point is probably pretty poor. That being said, the story itself is a fine one, and worthy of telling. My main advice is not to look at what you wrote and rewrite it though. Trust me when I say that you can fall into a trap of rewriting constantly your works. Instead read what I wrote, read what you wrote, and then write something new, something better. Writing new works is always a better way to work and progress with you writing than rewriting old works. This story is good, the writing is good, not perfect, not great maybe, but it shows potential. No one starts perfect, read more stories, write more stories, and one day, I'll have nothing worthwhile to offer you because you'll be a writer who is beyond the mere criticism of a random internet denizen. And that's fine, the more people that write more amazing stories, the happier I and countless others are. So keep at, and I hope one day to see your stories in print.",schlitzntl

[OT] A Guide to Writing Perfect Characters,JeniusGuy,"Huh, I feel like I've heard advice before but I'd say it's pretty sound.

The story should be working towards resolving the conflict, but if there's no tension then the protagonist isn't being challenged. And if the character isn't being challenged, then what makes the story any different than their normal life? 

I'm struggling to clearly get my thoughts out, but basically an interesting story explores the unknown, grand or small. If not, then it means the character isn't being stimulated and they are comfortable in their setting. As a result, they could be bored or content with their life, but I doubt they would say their life is interesting in that scenario.

Though I'd argue that Rothfuss' character, while he *does* have an unreasonable amount of power, is very fitting for the story. Rothfuss uses traditional story-telling with fairy tale tropes all over, then slowly breaks down the tropes to show reality in the fantasy. I think in part the reason I like the perfection of the character is because he shows clear flaws that you know are ultimately going to break Kvothe down until he loses almost all his power and is hiding in an inn. It adds momentum to a story that has--let's face it--basically no plot.

I'm looking for something that doesn't exist.""",KCcracker,"When the mist eyed man entered the shop and began flitting from bookshelf to bookshelf, Malcolm didn't pay him much attention. It was the end of his shift on a humid Saturday where all he could think about was the summer party happening later that night. And Tessa. Most of the bookstore's patrons made their way out of the cramped wooden door well before closing time.

All except for the mist eyed man.

He had been thumbing through books in every section, then shaking his head in disappointment before moving onto another shelf. Malcolm watched him glide through the sci-fi section, onto romance and business books before finally landing in religion and staying there for a while.

Malcolm eyes kept straying back to the clock that now read 5:55 pm, and then back to the man who had a stack of books ringing the creaky old wooden chair in the far corner of the shop. He sighed to himself and began re-shelving stray books while throwing glances in the corner occasionally at the quiet old man.

Finally, some minutes later, the strange man rose from his place and walked over to the counter. Oddly, he had no books in hand as he shuffled his way up to the counter top. ""Excuse me."" the man said shaking voice worn down by age and experience ""I hope I'm not bothering you, good sir. I'm looking for something that doesn't exist.""

Malcolm gave him an incredulous stare. ""You're uh...I'm sorry?""

""Yes,"" he beamed back at him ""It doesn't exist, well not yet anyway."" He looked back over his shoulder ""I think one of these books may be able to help me, but I'm not sure which?

Malcolm checked the clock again. 6:01 pm. ""I'm sorry sir, but we're actually closed now."" He explained ""Maybe you could come back tomorrow? I'm sure someone could help you as much as you need then."" 

The man heaved a tremendous sigh. ""No...no it must be today. That's quite alright then,"" the man turned back toward the door ""perhaps within the next 100 years then.""

""Wait!"" Malcolm wasn't sure why he was shouting, but the man stood stone still either way. ""Ah, 100 years? What do you mean?""

The man turned back, and shuffled his way up to the counter. Leaning forward he drew Malcolm in and whispered ""Yes, once every 100 years something that doesn't exist, does. It's only for the briefest of moments but it will revolutionize the way you see the world.""

Malcolm was intrigued. He thought about checking the clock again, after all the party started at 7 but then, he figured, how long could it take to help an old man find a book?

""Well, I can make a bit of time I suppose. What kind of book is it?""

""Books."" the old man corrected. He made his way back to the various shelves and began thumbing through the same books again. ""An author has a particular way of writing. A voice, if you will. This very special thing demands that the right voices come together in harmony."" He pulled an old, worn fantasy book down from the shelf and thumbed through it before handing it back to Malcolm.

""Harmony?"" he asked, while taking the book from the man's frail hands.

""Yes, yes harmony. Everything in the world is wrought in harmony and books are no different. Ah! Here."" He'd gathered a collection of books from every genre and indicated for Malcolm to lay them all out.

Malcolm obeyed, laying the books side by side while opening each to a different page.

""Yes, here this one should be page 219. And this, here should be page 15."" The misty eyed man pointed to the first book at the beginning of the row. ""And finally, the first page.""

""What now?"" Malcolm asked. His mind raced with possibility.

&gt;* Using the owner's blood as ink, write the names of the Heralds of Heaven all &gt;around the circle.
&gt;* Using a silver pin blessed by a true believer, pierce the chest of the homunculi.
&gt;* Spend the whole night praying over the circle, without faltering.

""Well, in my game against him I got this uncomfortable feeling, a sort of headache, and he just kept staring at me. Then, it passed, and he was playing perfectly around my combos, even though I've been nowhere near him all day, and no one else is playing Doran.""

He frowned slightly, ""Well you were at the top table and we're going into the final round, could just be nerves, you know, making things worse than they really are. Congrats by the way, didn't think Doran would be doing that well.

It's humorous how the world can change dramatically while you sleep. I woke up one day and began my normal routine by popping open reddit. Everything on the front page was dedicated in some way or form to the following headline: ""Nuclear explosion in Warsaw. Russian troops believed to be in Lithuania."" 

I didn't go to work that day. Hell, I didn't even call in. I just browsed reddit. /r/Poland was a mess. People were posting pictures of refugees pouring out of cities. Some burned. Some missing limbs. Many were blinded. All looked dead. There wasn't much from inside the city, though.

Links popped up on /r/news. ""NATO Response Force has been mobilized and is en route to Warsaw for relief operations"" ""NATO emergency meeting convened in Brussels"" ""Kissinger: Europe may seek peace and concede Baltic to Putin"" 

Seoul was the next to go. I'm no expert, but I gotta guess the North Korean government figured America would be too busy in Europe to worry about the People's Republic taking a shot at South Korea. They were very, very wrong. Within an hour, eight American nuclear weapons slammed in North Korea. Two hours later, four more followed. Pyongyang couldn't destroy America like Russia could. News camera from helicopters trailed masses of starving, irradiated citizens of the Hermit Kingdom as they swarmed over to South Korea and China.

The South placed them into hastily made refugee camps. 

The Chinese bombed them. Nobody was about to put up a fuss, though. America just glassed their neighbor's country. 

The world watched with bated breath as they waited for America's response. Twelve hours after I woke up to a world on the brink, the President had an answer. Speaking at a live press conference, he told an anxious crowd what he decided to do.

""Ten minutes ago, I authorized nuclear missile strikes on Saint Petersburg, Kazan, and Omsk. We will not stand for the wanton use of weapons of mass destruction.""

He walked away from the podium, leaving a room full of excited reporters to scream and shout without avail.

OPEC just consists of Venezuela now; the Middle East imploded into a horrible cataclysm of human sacrifice for reasons that aren't entirely clear, and the easiest solution for both us and Russia to claim that it was the main front in the skirmishes.

This comes just four days after the first wave of nuclear strikes launched by the US and just two days after the EU launched its own nuclear stockpile at the US. This is in response to the escalating conflict resulting from the US declaring war on the UK after the UK exposed the US Government's persecution of minorities including Muslims and Hispanics.

After scrolling through most of Europe god found Gary quickly moving in and out of a meeting hall.  Each time he emerged a larger following of angry white men followed him, all the while the world moved on at 20x its normal speed.

 ""Dammit, its stuck on fast forward again"" God shouted as he furiously clicked at the pause button. 

He glanced at the population counter in the right corner. Large red letters pronounced the population had just surpassed 1 billion. God had never thought human civilization could sustain itself at such large numbers.

 “I must find another plague, I really thought the last one would cull the population” God thought to himself. 
The counter continued to move up until the pause button finally engaged. “Jesus, get in here!” he yelled. 
A few moments later Jesus came ambling around the corner. 

“Did you find Gary, Dad?” Jesus meekly asked. 

“Yes, he has been building a following again. God replied tartly. “Jesus, this is why you can’t play with daddy’s game. Last time a character like Gary got loose I lost most of the inhabitants of South America” 

“I’m sorry” Jesus mumbled while staring at the ground. 

“It’s, It’s ok” God said turning back to the screen. “Just don’t do it again” 

Jesus ran out of the room. God turned back to the screen and created a secret police mandate to arrest Gary. “When will they learn that Xenophobia gets your country no where” he thought. 

He switched the game back to play at normal speed a message for the birth of Napoleon’s child flashed across the screen. “That’s nice” he thought, and quickly scrolled back to North America to check on its original inhabitants. He centered over Washington D.C. just in time to see the city begin to burn.

"[WP] You are serial killer that is killing bald people, because you think it's disgusting. One day, you spot bald spot on your head.",Wellbidlo,"***The uncovered ones must die.***

I have held this phrase in the center of my minds eye perfectly ever since I had been initiated; an angelic angel had come to me in a dream and given me very simple instructions, ""The uncovered ones must die,"" the angel said before rising in a pillar of flame back to the heavens.

Ever since that night, my life had had purpose, direction. My journey on this path has not been easy, nor has it been sane, but it has indeed produced results. I walked over to my trophy case and stared with undiminished wonder as I looked down upon  the shrunken heads of my foe's, all uncovered, all bald. The looks on their faces each told a different story, yet each one the same; they had all died in the face of terrible terror. 

I am that terror.

I walked into my bathroom, it had been a good day. I hadn't went for any kills, but I had discovered that the latest target that I've been stalking had the most routine life ever; it will be very easy for me to exploit that. I stepped in front of my giant bathroom mirror and gloried in my golden mane, it fell beautifully to my waist, as well as extending past my wide shoulders in breadth; surely no man on Earth had been blessed with such beautiful hair since Samson of Judea. I sat there in silence, stroking my golden mane, bathing in my awesomeness, when I felt it; I pulled my hand around to my eyes and sure enough, I had pulled a wad of my golden mane straight of my head. I winced a neurotic twitch.

I dove for my hand mirror, and using it in conjunction with my main mirror as if I was some kind of wizard I examined the top of my head; a menacing bald spot stared back at me.

_______________________________________________________

[Two days later]

***Destroy all the covered ones***

I had held that phrase in the center of my minds eye perfectly ever since i had received my initiation. Looking back it seemed like a life time, but in reality it had only been two days. An angel had come to my at night in a dream, ""***Destroy all the covered ones***,"" it had said to me before com-busting into a pillar of fire and returning to heaven.

I had been shown the light that night; before that night I had literally been doing Satan's work. The angel had come and shown me the error of my ways, who the true villains were, the prideful boasters, with their beautiful lion mane's, lovers of self instead of lovers of God.

"[WP]Children are no longer born. Instead, men and women appear throughout the world, knowing nothing, and immortal.",benevolas,"On March 6, 2017, 2:05 PM, the last child is conceived. It will take us months to fully realize this. At the same time, the homunculi begin appearing. They spring forth from the air, bud forth from the ground. Across the globe, nude people are found wandering in cities, villages, towns, remote offshore outposts, anywhere a population of humans exists. All of them without memory, without any sort of knowledge, wandering blankly through the world. 

The homunculi are not humans, that much becomes immediately clear when they are run over or shot or brutally beaten, and refuse to die. They do not feel pain, do not understand it, and show only a mild aversion to the worst sort of physical abuse. Their genitals are superficial, hanging flaps of skin, and are incapable of reproduction. They do not need to eat or drink, and they do not excrete. They lack bellybuttons. 

They are aliens. They are angels. They are demons. They are worshiped, their empty contemplation of the world taken as holy. They are rounded up, experimented on, dissected. They are kept secreted in households, nurtured and cared for. And every minute across the globe, hundreds more appear. 

They are born into existence able to walk upright and to maneuver through their environments, to observe, to understand, to learn. They repeat sounds spoken to them, making connections. Within a few weeks they are able to comprehend certain words, certain commands. They recognize their caretakers, or their abusers. They react with affection and curiosity. By now, we are beginning to understand, though we have not yet confirmed our growing fear: no one has been able to get pregnant since the homunculi began appearing. These are our children. 

All attempts at fertilization, even under laboratory conditions, fail. Human cloning, fast-tracked in the face of extinction, proves useless. Faced with the inevitability of our extinction, many displace the urge for continuity onto the homunculi, raising them as their own. They learn our languages, learn our cultures. To some they are children. To some they are deathless avatars, capable of carrying our legacy into the future with them. To others, they are tools. They can be taught to perform manual labor quite sufficiently without desire for compensation, and it soon becomes clear that they are fully capable of replacing us. Protests rise against homunculi being given human jobs. Hate crimes prove futile against the immortal. From nation to nation, they are either swiftly stripped of their rights, or gradually, gradually recognized as equivalent to human beings. July 7, 2023, six years after the homunculi first began appearing, is the first time they carry out terrorist attacks. 

As suicide bombers, they are fearless and utterly precise, heedless for their own safety. While fully clothed, they pass perfectly as human beings. When imprisoned, after they have been retrieved from the smoking ruins, they speak of the destruction of the West, the founding of an eternal caliphate that will rule long past humanity. In all other things, they are equal to humans. In violence they are far superior. The oldest among them are just over six years old, and are ready to be trained for war. 

Here is a mercy, or a condemnation: the homunculi that go undiscovered, those that wander feral for days or weeks before being found, lack the developmental difficulties that a child at the same stage of development would have. They cannot be harmed through neglect. They learn only what we teach them. 

The homunculi are a promise, many say, of a perfect world, a perfect future. War is purposeless among immortals, starvation and disease immaterial. They are our replacements, capable of achieving a world that still lies beyond our reach. They are Adam and Eve, multiplied a thousandfold, and we are denying them their chance for an Eden. What will happen when the last human dies? What if they retain our old flaws, our old prejudices, and continue to fight among each other regardless? 

This cannot be expected of us, others say. Our children are gone. Our future is gone. They are not us, they are not of us. We are dying, and they will live forever. Let them find their own way after we are dead. 

There is a gun at our heads, and our children smile at us, immortal. ",sadoeuphemist

""No."" The bear said, stretching his paws.

""Bear."" The snake tried to wrestle his way out from underneath, ""Bear with me through a game of wits. If I win, you will release me.""

""No thanks."" The bear said and patted the snake's nose before clacking his mouth and closing his eyes. ""Boop."" He said.

""Fine, then! I will bite!""

""No, No, No. It's sleepy time."" The bear grabbed the snake's mouth and held it closed. ""Double Boop."" He said.

""Mph! mmmph!"" The snake wrestled his mouth free and shouted, ""Fine! If you won't let me go, I will have to force you off. I warned you!""

The bear shrugged, ""What are you going to do?""

""Imma firin' mah laser!"" The snake said as it opened his now glowing mouth.

""Oh, no, wait!"" The bear, now fully awake, tried to move his hand towards the snake's mouth and close it, but he could not. The snake had won. 

Unfortunately, the bear's corpse was still on top of the snake and he still could not move free, leaving him to die of starvation.

[WP] Write a fable based around a foolish moral of the story.,bosox1275,"In a peaceful valley far from the sea, there once lived a very large and very aggressive fish. He among all the fish had a unique ability- he could fly through the air like a bird. He often used this skill to travel to and from each of the several small ponds in the area, leaving only terror and the bones of his meals as tokens of his visits. 

One day, after a particularly brutal feeding frenzy, a school of fish decided that they would devise a plan to stop the torment. ""We must overpower him!"" said one, but they all knew that their combined strength was no match for his sheer muscle. ""No, we should poison him"" cried another, but they knew they could not leave the water to retrieve the necessary ingredients. ""What if we trick him into getting killed by a human?"" a third fish asked, and this time no one blew bubbles at the idea. In fact, everyone liked it so much that the whole school decided right then and there that this was what they were going to do.

So the fish schemed and plotted, and generally did whatever fish do when planning the demise of the most notorious creature to ever swim in water and soar through air. When all was ready, they formed a tight school and waited for the arrival of the giant fish.

The wait soon payed off. With a whir of fins, the great fish descended from the sky and dive-bombed straight into the pond. As he finished swallowing the seagull he had caught en route, the fish noticed that his smaller peers were not fleeing as they usually would. ""What is the meaning of this?!"" he roared. ""Do you no longer fear me? Am I to be gawked at like some sort of circus act? I shall have to eat the whole lot of you! Maybe then you'll learn some respect for your superiors!""

 A fish bravely swam from her companions to address the great beast. ""Oh, no sir!"" she squeaked. ""We all very much admire your fine scales and your marvelous fins. You are, after all, the only one of us who can ride currents in both air and water!"" The fish glared at her. ""I shall take no flattery!"" he yelled, and ate her up right then and there in one quick snap of his jaws. The school did not break formation. Despite what he had said, the great fish seemed pleased by the compliment, and now swam back and forth in wonderful arcs to showcase his beauty.

Another fish decided to take advantage of his apparent contentment. ""Sir, we mean you no insults. It is just that we feel we are no longer worthy prey for such a great hunter as yourself. In our stead, we propose that you feed upon humans, who feed upon us. You shall then be the hunter of hunters."" The giant fish paused in the middle of a rather long arc. ""I must admit I am intrigued by your idea. Very well. I shall leave at once to prowl the skies for my next meal"". And, after gobbling down a couple more fish, he did just that.

The other fish watched in amazement as the great terror started to circle over the nearby woods. In less than ten minutes, it appeared that he had found a target, for at this time he plunged into the canopy at breakneck speed. A mass of bird-shot rose out of the forest to meet him, but each pellet merely bounced off of his impenetrable hide without impeding his progress whatsoever. Less than a second later, the school heard a bout of screaming, and then silence.

The great fish returned to the pond with a full belly. ""I nabbed a hunter"" he bragged, spitting out the shredded remains of a shotgun. ""And that means you don't have to eat any of us, right?"" a fish nervously asked. The giant fish turned his head in confusion. ""You know, I hadn't thought about that"" he said. ""As much as I would like to chomp you guys to bits, I really don't feel as if I could eat another mouthful. Have a nice night then."" With that, the great fish left the pond for the first time without eating anyone.

The fish sat in silence for a full minute, too shocked to react to what had just occurred. Then, all of the sudden, the pond erupted into merriment and cheers. ""We did it! We did it!"" the fish yelled. They had not killed their adversary, but they now had focused his attention on something else. A number of fishermen and hikers went missing from the area in the following years, but this did not trouble the school in the slightest, because for the rest of his life, the great fish never so much as nibbled on a fin. 

The moral of this story, boys and girls, is that if you ever encounter a bully, you should encourage him to hassle other kids so that you'll be left alone.

[WP] Write a fable based around a foolish moral of the story.,bosox1275,"In a distant and mysterious land more distant and mysterious than any of its kind, there lived four distinct intelligent races. First among them were the tree people, fey creatures of the woodland who held incredible power over trees and plants and anything green and remotely natural. Second were the mud people, creatures completely indistinguishable from the modern day human outside of the fact that their skin was entirely composed of mud. Third were the bird people, who held total dominion over the skies and weren't actually people at all, but merely birds. The final race was that of the turtle people, who made their home in the vast sea surrounding the small continent.

As one might imagine, all of these races were in constant conflict with each other. The tree people hunted the bird people for food. The mud people destroyed the tree people's forest homes to gather wood for themselves. The bird people defecated on the mud people without apology. And the turtle people imposed trade blockades around the island and hiked the prices up of imported goods. Constant skirmishing eventually led to an all-out war between these four factions.

All of the land-dwellers were sick and tired of being bombarded by the bird people's waste; as such, the three grounded factions teamed up to dispatch them first. With every tree under the tree people's control, the bird people found themselves with no place to roost and were felled by the mud people's artillery in under a week. The turtle people admittedly didn't contribute much; they were busy negotiating an arms deal with Russia.

At that point, the mud people and the tree people turned on each other. Each sought to broker a deal with the turtle people for their alliance: the tree people swore to stop fishing in their waters, while the mud people offered to cede their beach territories to the turtles. The prime minister of the turtle people promised to get back to each of them by the end of the week. In the interim, both the mud people and tree people suffered many casualties, with neither side gaining a sizable advantage over the other. Although the magic of the tree people was more potent than any of the weaponry the mud people could develop, the plants the tree people used as ammunition were constantly exposed and easy to take out. 

By the end of the week, the turtle people had come to a decision, as promised. They would side would neither mud nor tree and instead take on both factions. The mud people and tree people tried to unite as a last ditch effort, but it was too late: for two weeks, the turtles had bided their time, purposefully staying out of any sort of conflict while their three opponents had whittled each other away. It didn't help matters that the Russian artillery had also arrived, either. In the end, there was not enough of a resistance to stand against the turtle people; they expanded their territory from the sea to the land, killing and enslaving the remnants of the other factions.

The moral of the story is, of course, that slow and steady wins the race war.",hideouts

[WP] Write a fable based around a foolish moral of the story.,bosox1275,"There was once a very strong cat who lived in a village of cats. He was stronger than all the other cats, and loved to show off his great abilities. He could climb up to where the other cats could not. He could lift great rocks. And most importantly, he could beat any other cat in a fight. He ruled over the other cats from a high stone, and he was a great and popular leader because he would always help them with things they could not do. However, one day he decided to go about life differently. ""If I am the strongest, then why should I help them? Should not they be helping me, who does the most work?

That morning, a little kitten cried out, ""Leader, you are so big and strong, and I am so little and weak. All of the mice we must eat are up on your rock, and I am so hungry. Could you be so kind as to throw me a mouse or two?"" 

The leader replied, ""No! What have you done for me, little kitten? What have you done to deserve these mice more than I, who has caught most of these myself?""

In the middle of the day, an old cat cried out, ""Leader, you are so big and strong, and I am so little and weak. I have gotten my foot stuck under this great rock, and I cannot move. Could you be so kind as to lift it for me?""

The leader replied, ""No! What have you done for me, old cat? I have moved all this stone to make my throne, and you have moved none! Why do you deserve to be freed when you are not even strong enough or useful enough to free yourself?""

At night, all the cats under the leader's rule came to his throne. They cried out, ""Leader, we will not put up with you any longer! You've only been helping yourself, and there is nothing for the rest of us! We've come to take you down!""

The leader could not overpower all of his citizens, and fled far away. One day, after hours of walking, he came upon a plant on the top of a cliff. Hungry, he tried to eat it. It was the most delicious thing he'd ever tasted. He quickly finished it off, and then saw another one. He followed them to a vast field of the plants, where he became fat and happy. From his cliff, he saw his village. The homes were on fire, and everyone was running around without supervision. The mice were being stolen, and there was no leader to put a stop to it. The leader,, however, did not care. He sat on his rump, and ate the plant happily ever after.

There are a few morals in this story. One is that if life doesn't go your way, do drugs. Another is that cruel leadership is better than freedom. The third is that might makes right. ",Strongly_O_Platypus

He was hardwired with the attitude of a swashbuckling pirate, yet he was obscene in a very innocent kind of way. He was often a source of comedy when he would explode into anger over something as insignificant as a hair line fracture, yet it was just as deadly. His face would flush and swell, and  he largely  resembled  an overgrown bullfrog. He would stamp his feet in indignation  while his nostrils flared in synergy with his throbbing temple. ""You want my tarts? Over my dead body!"" "" I don't owe you a scent, you'll get that money when pigs fly!"" 

Lo and behold, one paticularly humid morning where Jim was in a black, black mood. He found himself in a row with the frumpy old hag he called his neighbour. ""You miserable man, if you had a woman Im sure your attitude would change, then again, she'd dive off a cliff having to deal with the likes of you! "" You ugly bitch, like you have any right to talk? Pigs will fly before a man dares touch your rotting carcasse!"" And so it began, a massive Oink! rumbled through the air. From his position near the reddish wall that separated him from his hellish companion, he saw a tinge of pink emerge, slowly yet steadily, rose from over yonder his neighbour's roof. ""Holy Shit!""

Upon reaching its zenith, the God of Swine unfurled the most magnificent wings he had ever seen. If Jim was a Christian, that's what he'd think angel's wings looked like.

""You have disrespected my kind for far too long, you will do so no more""  ""I must be dreaming"" and Jim pinched himself, but it was an ezcercise in futility. ""Oink! Your time has come!"" With a deep breath , Wilbur shouted, ""Arise!""

What do you do with this power?,mad100141,"The original universe, perhaps even that was not the first, was the one Marcus Cameron had been born into. A fit, strapping young lad with a sense of courage and a happy go lucky attitude. His grades in school were relatively good, he was surrounded by a band of good friends and although he often abused his mother's home with house parties that literally shook the neighborhood, he was a responsible young man.

It was when he passed that dreaded driving exam that everything went out of the window, he could go where he wanted, do as he pleased, feel the ultimate freedom as he coasted down the freeway, passing the speed limit as if he were trying to break a record. Marcus Cameron met a poor fate. On one such day, he took a sip of a bottle, then a turn of the wheel and he lay dead, limbs hanging off the roof of his car.

That's when Marcus joined the *second* universe. Not that there was a **jump** of any kind. Marcus woke up, warm in his bed on the morning that he killed himself and three of his friends. He no longer drank and drove, and merely thought the experience a dream. He put it at the back of his mind, and yet still when he was confronted for a beer run when he had already drank his liver into submission, he could no longer put his foot on the pedal. 

Three months after the dream, he was drafted. A gun was shoved in his hands and after eight weeks, he was thrown out in Vietnam to fight the *good* fight. He and his team moved across the jungle, following a lead that Vietnamese munitions had been hidden deep in the leaves. His men were fired upon, and all assumed they were dead, but Marcus was different. He was the golden boy, the man who would make it out alive, that was what he believed. Finally, he saw glory, and he managed to pop eight of the proclaimed 'gooks' until the next thing he saw was the blood in his eyes, before falling back to look at the sky before he slept the long sleep. Marcus woke up again, back at base camp, and when discussing the lead they had been given, he advised his officers otherwise to be denied.

Despite his knowledge, he was killed, and awoke once more. A cycle of hundreds of times, and Marcus became persuasive, and proved that he was right. It was a trap, and avoiding such a catastrophe saved his, and his men's skin. He had become persuasive enough to lead, and after several promotions, left military service soon after the war had ended with a hefty pension.

Marcus Cameron grew old. He lay in bed, not his own but in a hospital and breathed one last time. Having happily said his goodbyes, and signed off his will, he died with little regret.

Fate thought not. Marcus Cameron awoke once more, the fresh hair hit his pink skin like a jolt of ice water to the face, his eyes had become gunky and teary, but when the blur cleared he saw men in surgical masks, bright lights singing his retina, helpless to move. Thrown about from doctor to doctor, and finally to his mother.

Marcus Cameron only wished for rest, but fate did not allow him. His only relief was journey that left him to sit in the same universe, until it ended and then surpass it.

Marcus Cameron had saw it all, he had lived lives of suffrage, he had lived lives of lavish wealth. He had murdered, and lied. He had cheated and raped. He became a hired killer, and in some lives he became a doctor. Marcus Cameron could become anything, and become anyone, all he had to do was reset his life when he got bored. Marcus Cameron, ever since the day he died in that car had never felt stuck, not once in his life. No matter how far he was into the game, he could change. No matter the sin he had committed, he could be forgiven. Marcus Cameron did not travel to alternate worlds, he merely went back and shaped them.",Daveclap
[WP] You have the ability to travel to alternate universes. What do you do with this power?,mad100141,"I groaned as I accepted the tall pint glass from the bartender.  Man, after today, dealing with Janet's countless stupid email requests, I really needed this drink.  I might even refill the glass a few times, just to make sure that I scrubbed the memory of dealing with that awful woman out of my head.

Taking a sip of the brimming glass, I turned and glanced around Third Street Bar, looking for an open table.  Given as it was right at quitting time on a Friday, however, the place was packed.  I finally spotted an open seat in a booth near the back.

I carefully wove my way over to the booth, noting that the other side was occupied by a gentleman with a baseball cap pulled low over his face.  ""Mind if I sit here?"" I asked him politely.

He glanced up - and I jumped, my beer slopping over the edge of my glass and cascading down over my fingers.  ""Holy shit,"" I exclaimed.

""Yeah, might as well go ahead,"" I heard my own voice reply, coming from my own face as my doppelganger looked up at me!

I sat down in the booth across from him, largely because my legs felt unsteady, about to give out at any moment.  ""But- what- how-"" I stammered, shaking my head as I wrung beer off of my fingers.

He - I - grinned back at me.  ""Yeah, that's the reaction that usually happens.""  My own face, on the man across from me, grew thoughtful for a second.  ""Except for that one time I tried to kill myself.  That was a weird one.""

""I don't understand,"" I stammered out.

I - he - oh, hell, this is getting confusing.  My doppel just raised a hand to me.  ""I've worked out a decent explanation,"" he said.  ""Just humor me for a minute, would you?""

Not knowing what else to say, I nodded - and took a big gulp of my beer, hoping that maybe this was all just some sort of dehydration fueled delusion.

My doppel didn't vanish, however.  ""Okay, look.  This all starts with me telling you a fact.  Alternative realities exist.  Can you believe that?"" he asked.

After a moment, I slowly nodded.  ""So you're from-""

""Just hold on a minute and listen.  ""Anyway, alternate realities exist.  Of course, things are different in them, and there's an infinity of them.  In some, you pursued other careers.  In some, you weren't even born.  In some, you're a girl.   And in some of them, you're a scientist.  With me so far?""

I nodded, taking another sip of beer, and my doppel continued.  ""As I said, in some of them you're a scientist.  In one of them, you happen to be a very good scientist, and you discover that there are alternative realities - and you work out a way to travel between them.""

I hadn't drank enough to slow my cognitive processes yet.  ""And that's you?  Or you're that particular version of me, at least?""

My doppel looked pleased.  ""Hey, you catch on a lot faster than some versions of us!""

""Well, I do read a lot of science fiction,"" I demurred.  ""Although now, I wonder what I could have become if I actually focused on science.""  I enviously eyed the version of myself sitting across the table.  ""Man, you must have some adventures, huh?""

Instead of excitement, however, my doppel just sighed.  ""Trust me, it gets old,"" he answered.

""What?  What do you mean?""

He paused, taking a gulp of his own drink.  ""I mean, look.  Imagine that you could hop to another universe, whichever one you want.  Where would you go first?""

I didn't need to stop and think.  ""Magic!  You could find a universe where magic exists!""

""Yeah, I thought that, too - and I did.""  My doppel gestured down at himself.  ""I mean, it was ley lines and tapping into dark energy flows through our universe, unseen and unfelt, but same sort of thing.  I'm pretty much immortal now, thanks to all the elixirs I chugged while there.""

""So why'd you move on?""

He sighed.  ""Listen, this is a curse.  It doesn't feel like one at first, but I know what's out there.  Or rather, I don't know, but I can imagine, and it's awful.""

""Why is that bad?  I'd think that it would be incredibly fun-""

""Oh, it is at first.  But nowhere ends up being good enough.""  He took another sip of his drink.  ""You pick the most amazing place, settle down, and then your mind starts wandering.  I would wake up next to my supermodel wife and look over at her, and just think to myself, what if there's something better out there?""

""And is there?""

""Oh.""  Maybe he was right, but I couldn't quite bring myself to feel like he had it worse off than I did.  ""So what are you doing here, then?  I'm sure there's another universe where you could be having way more fun.""

""Probably.""  My doppel lifted his glass again, this time draining it.  ""But this place has good beer, and right now, that's all that I want.""

I reached out and picked up his glass.  ""Well, let me buy myself another round,"" I said, trying to cheer the poor fellow up.  ""But when I get back, you have to tell me about dinosaurs, okay?""

My doppel brightened slightly.  ""Deal.  By the way, you know how scientists think that they had feathers, now?""

""Yeah?""

""Well, there's nothing scarier than seeing a twenty foot tall chicken charge you, trying to eat you.""  He waved me off.  ""Get the beer, and I'll tell you all about it.""

[PM] I'm looking for a challenge. Throw me a prompt and I'll rise to the occasion.,madlabs67,"I was ripped from my sleep by a thump on the stairs. The sound was like an electric shock moving through my veins. Immediately I froze, trying desperately to halt my heartbeat and breathing in order to listen to the intruder in our house. It couldn't be the war. The front was miles from here. There was no way the defenses had been breached. Our side was winning!

But each creak of the carpeted stair made me doubt even further. I wanted to burrow back into the oblivion of sleep. The loudest step was the third, that meant whoever it was was on the sixth by now. There were twenty seven steps in total. In the bed next to mine my brother rolled over in a whisper of sheets.

""Michael!"" I hissed, slipping out from my own. The intruder was more than halfway up. I crawled carefully across the dangerous terrain. The floor was littered with legos. I curled one hand into my stomach as it was stabbed by a particularly sharp corner. Biting back a whine of pain I continued to my brother's sleeping form. Reaching one hand up I slid it gently over his face and grasped his chin and lips, effectively sealing them with my fingers. The rapid thrashing as he woke was muffled by the thump of my mother getting up. She had heard the noise too. I begged her silently not to open her door and confront them. Keeping my hand on my brother's face I clambered up beside him, pinning him down with my limbs and weight. Finally he went limp, and from the dim crack in the blinds I could see his eyes drilling into me balefully. I ignored him, looking towards the door. Were they at the landing yet?

Something moist and rough against my palm made me shiver in disgust. My brother was licking my hand in order to trigger a release. The tactic might have made me let go on any other day, but for now I clenched my jaw, vowing to smack him a good one if we made it out of this. I listened as my mother opened her door. By my count the intruder would be-

There. The sound of a foot on a heavy surface indicated that the stairs were over. *Please let it be a burglar,* I begged. I squinted my eyes shut, and jumped when I heard a shot fire. It was loud, and close. Suddenly my brother felt small beneath me. He'd stopped trying to get out from under me.  When I opened my eyes again I saw that he was no longer glaring, but staring desperately with wide eyes. He looked utterly terrified, and I didn't dare move.

As if the shot had been a signal, there was now a rumble on the stairs. Too many feet for me to count. My mind went blank in panic.

""Someone suppress her. You, and you! Check the bedroom for children. We leave no one behind!"" The commanding voice was unfamiliar, low, and its words swirled around my head. Breathing shallow, I waited for the searching feet to reach our end of the hallway. Doors slammed open and lights flicked on. I could now see the legos scattered on our floor dim lighting from the crack below our door. Closer and closer the search came, no longer hiding their presence, choosing speed over stealth. I couldn't hear our mother. No screams, no cries, nothing. 

I squinted my eyes shut again and leaned forward. Impulse pushed me to whisper in my brother's ear, ""The first chance you get, run for it. Find some of our soldiers, find dad. They can save us.""

I didn't say what was really going on in my head. If the enemy was here, that meant dad, and the soldiers, had already fallen. There was no finding them. But it was all I had to offer.

The door burst open and I cringed from the light. I resisted as the large bulk, clad in an enemy uniform, stomped over the legos to pull me off my brother. He screamed as soon as he was released from the prison that was me. He kept on screaming as another soldier slung him over his shoulder. I didn't look as I was dragged out into the hallway. I didn't want to see if my mother was lying there with blank eyes. I tripped and stumbled, blind to the world around me, bombarded by sounds. My own breath, my brother's voice, the thump and shouts of soldiers and our neighbors.

Eventually we were outside, on our street. It was pitch black. No one had lit the street lamps since the beginning of the war, light made the cities and the suburbs easy targets in the dead of night. A hand shoved me onto my knees. I winced again, biting my lip as my skin tore on contact with the rough surface of our road. My brother was kicked down beside me, now silent. As my eyes adjusted I could see the same process being repeated all around the street. The people I had known my entire life were spilling out of their homes, chased by men in hostile uniforms.

We were left alone. The soldiers had returned to our house, further scouring it for people. I snuck a glance around. I couldn't make sense of their plan. It would have been easier to shoot us on sight. Why bring us outside? I didn't know the answer.

""Michael,"" I hissed for the second time that night. Trying to signal him. If we were to have a chance, this would be it. He knew the area better than me, certainly better than the enemy. Shakily he stood, uncertain in his bare feet and terror driven legs. I almost shouted at him. ""Go!""

He took off. He had made it halfway down the road when I heard someone shout, ""Hey you! Stop!""

My brother only bent his head and I saw his legs move faster. In that moment I was proud of him. No wonder he had won the cross-country race for his age division. He was fast. Better than fast. But I'd forgotten that bullets were so much faster than people.

I couldn't bite back my yelp of shock. The explosive sound of the gun was so close as it fired, as if it were right above my head. I could almost hear as the projectile ripped through my brother's flesh and his skinny figure fell. I pitched forward as a burn ripped up from my gut and out my mouth. I heaved the acidified remains of my last dinner onto the street in front of me.

*Please,* I begged again. *Please, just... Make it his leg. Not his heart, or his head. Please tell me he's going to live.*

But the sounds feeding into my ears, above my own retched vomiting, told me otherwise.

This message is for all passengers and staff currently aboard the S.S. Serina. We are now entering a Code Purple. Passengers, please make your way to the nearest employee and follow their instructions. Employees, please refer to your manuals for the best course of action.""*

Paul Koombs heard the announcement as he was chopping the onions. Head chef on the renowned interstellar cruise ship, he enjoyed adding a personal touch to each dish that left his kitchen for the white table clothes on the deck above. Patiently, he ignored the old fashioned intercom for his work. Each slice of the blade brought the cutting edge closer to his knuckles, until eventually, the onion was reduced to perfectly even morsels, ready for that night's stuffed flank steak.

""Sir,"" one of the younger kitchen-aides began. Koombs looked up to confront the girl meeting her straight in the eyes. He was rather infamous among the crew for his intense gaze. Not many could meet it before their own slipped sideways onto the wall or bustle behind him.

""Yes?"" He inquired lightly.

""There's a Code Purple."" Another young person, the dishwasher this time, gestured limply with one hand in the vague direction of the speaker.

""And?"" Koombs responded, using his knife he scraped the vegetable into a waiting pot.

""Aren't we, you know, supposed to..."" the boy trailed off and shrugged, ""do something? Direct passengers? Or lock the doors?""

That made Koombs set his knife down. Pincing his lips together he wiped his hands with the edge of his apron. He squinted around the room, glasses bleary from the greasy steam of cooking.

""Have none of you read the manual?"" He asked. All the younger faces shook their heads, some looked abashed. There weren't many that didn't show shame. Those that didn't had been hired on years before. They'd all encountered a Code Purple more than once, and most of them with Koombs heading the kitchen throughout. Koombs planted his hands on his hips.

He was a tough, wiry little man. In his late fifties, by Earth years, he was blind in one eye and his hair still hadn't thinned. It had simply turned to steel cords. Age wasn't displaying any of its usual limitations. Not in Paul Koombs at any rate. He was much sought after by various restaurants across the galaxy. His knowledge of Earthly, and other, cuisine was unparalleled.

""Well,"" Koombs scratched his chin, ""let's put it this way. Do you know what a Code Purple is?""

Again, the staff shook their heads. The chef sighed. Around him, the senior members of his kitchen turned their attention back to the sauces they were stirring and the bread they were kneading.

""A Code Purple means there're some unwelcome guests aboard and they'll be commandeering the ship. Most likely bandits of some sort, after the treasures and valuables of the passengers. Space pirates I guess you can call'em."" He chuckled. He continued. ""Which means, that none of them will be stopping by to taste test tonight's supper.""

""But, I though it meant hostages!"" One person blurted.

""Of course we're hostages! What else would we be?"" Koombs asked startled. ""But why would they want to bother us? Security will have this all wrapped up in a jiffy, and then what will the passengers say if they can't have a hot bowl of Peanut Stew?""

The young ones stared at him, mouths agape in astonishment. Koombs quirked a smile.

""The tragedy!"" He moaned dramatically. ""Some ill prepared criminal boarded a ship and is threatening life and limb for a few jewels. But he's completely outnumbered, doesn't know the layout of the ship, and can't afford to kill anyone because he wouldn't be able to pilot the vessel in the first place.""

""Take it from me. We're in deep space. That means he's trapped in here with us. It's more like he's *our* hostage.""

""But what if he comes to the kitchen anyways?"" Someone protested.

""Then,"" now Koombs picked up his blade again. Holding it expertly he pointed it at the inquiring member of the team. His entire demeanor changed in that instant. His smile was chilly, stretched tight between his ears. Both eyes, good and bad, were blazing with an eager malice. ""Either I go, or they do. But believe me. I'm not the easy picking they think I am.""

Having said that, his stance relaxed back into that of a chef; easy going and jovial, the shift was just as sudden and rapid as the first time.

""Now. How about we get back to work? The stew won't make itself you know. Olly? How's the bread coming along?""

As the chef turned his back on the youngsters, they couldn't quite shake the image they'd seen earlier. A man, deadly and cunning, waiting for someone to test his mettle. Just for the fun of it. Involuntarily their youthful hands clenched, the fight or flight response initiated and running through their veins.

Unfortunately he had assumed that they were behind a fence, just like the rest of the 'yapperjackers' barking at him. As soon as he saw them though, he knew he'd been wrong.

There were only two, both of them mutts on the larger end of the scale for size and heft. Matted fur was a crusted non-descript grey and brown. The pair were clearly strays, but the clarity in their eyes and bared teeth told Roy that they thrived in their condition. Old scars from territory disputes were visible on their muzzles. New ones cut a startling pink against the bland hair surrounding the bald patch.

Roy looked behind the pair. His arrival had distracted the duo. Now that a human was around they had fallen silent, pacing back and forth. Roy's eyes, still keen from his youth, easily picked out the turkey carcass the dogs had stolen.

""I'm not gonna steal it."" Roy murmured to the pair. Crossing to the opposite side of the street to respect their space, he looked back to see their reaction. Both mutts were watching him, ears up, eyes not missing a single twitch from Roy. Satisfied that they hadn't moved, Roy shuffled along, his mind already contemplating his armchair at home. 

Sadly, for Roy, his ears weren't as sensitive as his eyes. Weakened by time, they couldn't pick up the subtle nuances of claws on pavement, or the rapid step of paws on cement. Instead, the only indicaton Roy had of the attack was when the full weight of the larger dog bore into his legs, bowling him over. Balance, like his ears, had suffered in his progression from youth to senior.

It was hard for Roy to keep track of those initial few moments on the ground. In the chaos of pain, teeth and blood, he was jerked around relentlessly. Roy did the only thing he could at that point. As he struggled to reclaim his limbs from the maws of his aggressors he yelled. There was a chance that if he yelled loud enough, someone would come.

I could tell if someone was going to respond to a prompt by the number of upvotes it got in the first hour. The internet, and reddit in general, was fickle, but some things couldn't be turned around. 

I was crushed. Confusion and hurt was lapping at the edges of my mind. I'd always enjoyed my time in the community. There was always someone about to prompt and criticize. But for the first time, this didn't hold true. Errantly I wondered if I'd been shadowbanned. Surely one of the mods would have taken pity on me if that were the case. They liked me right? Or tolerated me at the very least.

My mind drifted as I stared at the empty comments section. Some bird outside was having a marvelous time singing its heart out. It truly was a gorgeous day. Sunshine streaming in through all my second story windows, and the foliage drifting in a gentle breeze. Maybe it wasn't such a bad thing not to be prompted. I couldn't deny that I'd hesitated before putting out the call for prompts. It was a shame to stay indoors today, especially after almost a week of being outside and exploring. I studied my options. I could go swimming, or for a bike ride to the next town. I could finish the final book from my raid on the library three days previous. I could go for another hike. I could draw. I could call a friend.

I looked at the clock. Only three more hours until she got off work. Well I could find something else to do until then.

[PM] I'm looking for a challenge. Throw me a prompt and I'll rise to the occasion.,madlabs67,"As a kid I had always dreamed of causing ruckus. If the teacher wanted me to sit, I rolled on the floor. If I was told to stay with the group I intentionally got lost. Regretfully as I grew, my parents and teachers squashed the rebellious streak into dormancy. High school passed by with hardly an incident.

Oh, I'd had plans for that time period. Putting alarm clocks in the ceilings, stealing the actual clocks from all the classrooms so no one could tell time, putting the principal's truck for sale on the internet. Maybe if I'd had the opportunity then, I wouldn't have snapped now. A menial nine to five job had pushed me past the brink of sanity and the kid that had been lying comatose all this time resurfaced. Feigning normalcy, I plotted.

First, I needed a stage. What was the point of causing havoc if I didn't have a stage or an audience? I knew exactly where to go: New York. The hub of activity. The swelter of people. The helpless dependence on everything running as it should. It was a fruit ripe for the picking.

Second, I needed a target. This was a more challenging aspect. All cities require certain elements, water and electricity being two of them. For days I flip-flopped between mucking up the sewer systems, the water system, the power source and the streetlights. There were too many options to choose from. I finally settled on power. I'd cut the electricity supply. All of it. That meant internet, the streetlights, everything would be shut down. The chaos would be sweet.

Thirdly, I needed a team. My biggest headache came when I realized its small numbers. A million bucks? What could a person do with a million bucks in New York? But that wasn't the worst of it. *One* clown with a chainsaw, *thirty-seven* convicted felons dressed as hookers and *one* army of highly trained chickens.

The chickens were sent in as a distraction tactic. It's bloody hard to catch the cursed creatures, and even less so if they've been trained to attack and evade. As the employees chased after the seemingly stupid birds, the felons snuck up to overpower them. Knocking the men out, they stole the uniforms and proceeded. The theft happened for two reasons: a disguise for further infiltration would make the job easier, and I was tired of looking at the men tottering around on their itty-bitty stilettos. Once that had been accomplished I directed them to ""cut"" the power. We did a mangled job of shutting everything down and damaging it enough so that it would take hours to fix.

I'd say it worked fairly well. For a full thiry-seven hours the city was in stasis. Traffic was stalled, entire businesses were shut down, I savored the sweet taste of victory. I dismissed the men, telling them to keep the clothes they stole, paying them each their share of the one million. The chickens disappeared, returning to the farm where I had found them. The clown? Well, I'd originally been stumped at how to use him. Desperate to get him off my back I told him to ""make something up"". Eventually I heard he'd chosen to rob a bank. That explained why the police hadn't bothered tracking me down. For an unnecessary member of the team, he sure did his job well. Whatever it was supposed to have been.

Looking back on it now, I would have liked to have at least three of the chicken armies. They were the most valuable aspect to the venture. But in a miraculous feat of strategy and tactical maneuvers, I managed to execute the mission. I wonder if they'd be willing to help out a second time?",madlabs67

Allen Rigger, owner of Rigged Vacuums: My, I’ve never seen anything like this!

Worker 1: What’s up boss?

Allen: This man… he vacuums so amazingly. How does he do it?

Worker 2: Well, it could either be the fact that the competition’s vacuum is ten times better than ours or the fact that the competition’s vacuum is ten times better than ours.

Allen slams his fist down on the table: I will not have any of this such talk!

Worker 1: Or, it could just be the fact that Scotty is a god.

Allen: What? 

Worker 2: You haven’t heard? There are conspiracy theories that Scotty is from an alternate universe where people are trained to do house-hold chores or they are removed from society.

Allen: My god, that really is awful.

Worker 2: What should we do about Scotty?

Allen grins deviously: I have an idea. It will just take time.

[SCENE SWITCH BACK TO TELEVISION STUDIO]

TV Set Manager: Great job Scotty! You killed it again.

Scotty: Thanks, I mean, that is a compliment, right?

TV Set Manager: I don’t know, it’s just something my kids tell me every time I take their puppy for a walk. Anyway, at this rate, you should be getting a call from the big time sponsors any day now!

Scotty: Sweet! I would love a sponsor for once. By the way, how are my ratings?

TV Set Manager: They couldn’t be better, they’re through the roof! Everybody loves you, Scotty.

Scotty: That’s great, I wish I could love myself.

It’s seven o’clock p.m. as Scotty stands on the balcony of his multi-million dollar apartment suite located in the high rise of TV Land. He’d always wanted to make it here, and he had, but something just didn’t feel right. He didn’t feel at home. He shakes his margarita glass and watches the olive float around freely. He drops the olive over his balcony down the thirty floor building towards the crowd of picketers slash worshippers down at the bottom of the building. Typically, picketers were bad, but these were people holding signs, asking Scotty to clean their house, or pool, or ask him to clean their toilets. It seemed as though there was a sign for any simple house chore that people needed done. “I’ve lost my child.” One sign reads. “Please help me clean my house and find it!” Scotty sighs and walks inside the open air apartment. He wishes that people knew where he really came from, his home.

Scotty had been teleported to this world shortly after he was doing the laundry in his home universe. A penny had slipped into the cracks of the washing machine. Mother was sure to punish him severely if he had left it in there, so brave Scotty climbed into the washing machine, which was sitting next to the washer. When Scotty climbed back out, he was in the apartment he was now, stuck here for what seemed to be an eternity. How could he get out? Scotty didn’t know. It was a question that he asked every day though. He was lost in thought until his butler waved for his attention.

Gabriel the butler: Sir, what shall it be tonight, crackers and cheese or butter bread?

Scotty: Oh, I don’t know Gabriel. Maybe just throw a pizza in the oven?

Gabriel: Pizza? Oh yes, that delicacy you taught me how to cook. Just put it in the oven at four hundred degrees, right? Something like that?

Scotty: Yes Gabriel, you are right.

Gabriel: Oh, how I wish I could cook like you can!

Scotty: Gabriel, I have to go do my laundry. Please let the pizza sit in the warmer when it is done.

Gabriel: Oh yes, the warmer that you sponsored last week. It sure is a good thing we have a good pizza warmer!

Gabriel bounces over to the kitchen and prepares the pizza. Scotty walks over to the large laundry room. What is that he hears? Clink, clink, clink, clinkety clack. A coin? That’s the answer! Climb back in after the penny and, when he does, he should be able to climb out and be home, right?

Nobody had heard the entrance of Allen Rigger into the Carman Residence. He had planned it well, and he was going to eliminate Scotty at any cost. He had remotely turned off the security cameras, but the butler was going to be a pain to have to hide once he was dead. Allen walks quietly into the living room from a hallway door. 

Allen: Hey there, I’m a business partner of Mr. Carman. Any chance he’d be home?

Gabriel turns around suddenly and stops singing “Afternoon Delight” as he twirls the pizza in the air: Why yes, he just mentioned that he was going into the laundry room. I think he’s still there.

Allen is delighted: Thank you, thank you very much.

Allen smiles mischievously and walks down the hallway. Leave it to the best chore doing person in the planet to be doing chores. Allen follows the map he memorized down the hallway to the laundry room. He crakes open the door and looks around. Where is that Scotty? Turns out, Scotty is just done retrieving the penny, but the dryer door has closed on him. He pounds on the door frantically, trying to get out. Allen smiles, he really did have his work cut out for him. 

Now, how did this fancy machine work? There were so many buttons, if only he understood them. Then he remembered his pattern that he had memorized. “Colds, Soap Rinse, One Hour, Start.” He says this a few times while he looks for the buttons. He finally gets the combination and hits start. Goodbye Scotty. Allen watches as Scotty’s wide eyes stare back at him as he turns around and around and around. Allen props a chair against the washing machine and walks out of the room, rubbing his hands against themselves as he walks down the hallway. He walks into Scotty’s room, locks the door, and closes it as he walks back into the hallway. 

Allen: Scotty must be taking a nap, he wasn’t in the laundry room and his bedroom door is locked. Can you let him know that I’ll come back on Monday? Thanks.

Gabriel tries to respond but the main door to the apartment is closed already. Allen is gone.

And so is Scotty.

One of those who is always in and out of gaol. Of course, no one of the other inmates know why I am in there. This is something that is simply *not asked*. But maybe I should explain a bit more and a bit further: In Germany during Bismarck's time, there was a job called Sitzredakteur which was a journalist who never wrote a single line for the newspaper, but if the government complained about an article took responsibility and sat out the jail sentence. We have no censorship like that anymore. Governments have decided on more subtle ways of influencing people. We still have reasons to sit in somebody else's stead though. Like murder. Now, please don't look at me like this and think about why murder is bad. I do not mean this as a trick question. Sure, there are religious reasons in the 'gita, the qu'ran, the wiccan texts and the fricking bible, but in a secular position, the murderer robs the murderee the ability to experience things, they also often cause the murderee to suffer. Now, I believe in bodily autonomy and I don't hold life sacred. Everyone, from the highest priest to the lowest NEET, has the right to decide on whether they want to continue living. It used to be possible to state that you didn't want to be kept alive artificially or resuscitated. That is, until the Catholic fringe got power and argued that euthanasia was evil. Which brings us to what I do: I pull the plugs of those whho didn't want to keep living but have to according to the law. Then I am caught, sentenced to sometimes a few months, sometimes only a few days of jail, and return. It is a crappy job, but crappy situations require people to do crappy jobs.

I feel a lump in my throat begin to form. I try to speak but my voice cracks ""A cyanide pill in her yogurt, it was a peaceful death.""  I let out the breath I was holding and continue ""She was already dying your honour, as you know my dad and her husband recently passed and because of it she ached from the loss. I did it to put her out of her missery.""

The jeering and shouting worsens and I feel myself crumble to the ground, sons wracking the courtroom. 

The judge looks at the sentence and sighs before shouting for quiet. ""as much as this pains me but Mr Adams you're free to go. Right here it shows that as you said she was dying, but much sooner than we had expected. In fact it shows she died before the cyanide took effect.""

My sobbing slowly stops but instead start whimpering like an injured animal. What I hear shocks me, causing me to have lose control of myself and start sobbing harder than before.

"[WP]If you murder someone, your jail sentence is as long as their remaining life would have been.",retrac101,"""I'm not a murderer!"", he told his cellmate on the verge of tears.

Abdur Fazil wasnt a cruddy, dreadful, or at least bad man. On the contrary, he had dedicated his short yet adventurous life to serving others. While participating in several United Nations Volunteers projects he had saved, or at least tried to, hundreds of lives. Starving children whose limbs had been taken by the kurds, refuggees from Kobani who had lost it all, HIV patients in North Africa, domestic violence victims from Saudi Arabia. Hell, he had even met Malala Yousafzai once. This Turkish man was indeed an honorable person, a modern day hero we could even say.

Of course, this was not the way the media portrayed him. Every newspaper from ""The New York Times"" to ""Al Jhazeera"" found pleasure in describing him as a Muslim extremist criminal who, in a sudden ""masculinist radical islamist rush of hate"", actual quote from a Japanese magazine, had brutally murdered his own sister, Badilah Fazil.

Badilah was all to Abdur, he loved her from feet to head, and I mean this in the literal sense. A long way from being a simple yet deep brother and sister relationship, this two were deeply entangled in an incestuous sexual relationship. Badilah and Abdur were passionate lovers, from day to night they would get it on whenever they could, in the bathroom, on the kitchen table, in the attic, dumpsters, airports, schools, Abdurs workplace, Badilahs workplace, no matter where they were as long as they had privacy. Although disgusting, one could never argue that they didn't love each other, it was obvious that they did, they had a romance that made Romeo and Juliet look like a childs play. Of course, of course, this was not enough for the media, ""Abdur raped constantly, at least three times a day"", or my favourite ""Abdur satisfied his incestuos violent needs by pounding his sick sisters flesh over and over, always against her will""

Naturally, this could not end well.

Time went by and with it came sickness for Badilah. It all happened too fast. One day she was a beautiful turkish woman with all of her life yet to be lived, and in just twentyfour hours she had turned into a terminally ill patient with a brain tumor as big as a tennis ball. One month. That is how long doctors told her she would live, they told her she should try to extract as much juice as she could from the little fruit she had left. And so she did.

Badilah and Abdur planned it all, they would travel through Europe for two weeks and go back home for all the last goodbyes Badilah wanted to give, after finishing Abdur would take her life, as she didn't want to suffer the pain of this illness, which doctors described meticulously, a process so harsh and ugly even I can't describe it.

Passion and love were the main objective. From the bathrooms of the tour Eiffel to the abandonned cells of the colloseum they loved each other everywhere. 

The day came. It was almost 3 p.m. and Badilah had decided it was her time to go. It was common practice that loved ones practiced euthanasia to their partners, as the law clearly established that ""It is fair that he who takes the life of another shall serve imprisonment for as much time as the victim had left"". So everything happened fast, and she gasped for the last time at 3:45 p.m.

The police came, and with them the forensic team. Violence wasnt needed, after all this was common practice for the terminally ill. They took the corpse and Abdur to the police station. 

The process was taking too long, and Abdur was starting to get nervous. As the hours went by there were no more nails to be eaten and no patience to be left. Ten hours. Thats how long it took for the forensic team to tell Abdur that not only was his sister perfectly fine, although now dead, but she was also pregnant with triplets.

Abdur never came out of the police station, he was found hanging from the ceiling of his cell, completely violet from the lack of oxygen. No one wants to serve 290 years in prison, 80 for each unborn and 50 for his lover.

The love of his life, his sister. He had taken her life. Abdur, an infertile 31 year old had killed his cheating fucking lover.

It was supposed to be quick and clean- in and out, and fifty million richer- but things went south and I ended up killing our mark.

"[WP]If you murder someone, your jail sentence is as long as their remaining life would have been.",retrac101,"Jeremy understood the foolish risk of attending the trial.  Even after dyeing his overgrown hair and his poor excuse for a beard a nondescript shade of brown, he knew any number of people in the courtroom could recognize him.  He deliberately seated himself near the back and refrained from stealing glances at his grieving mother or the few friends that bothered to attend.  If any of them met Jeremy's eyes for even a fleeting moment, they would surely recognize him.  But he had to be there.  He couldn't wait any longer. 

The judge called upon the forewoman of the jury.  ""Members of the jury, have you reached a verdict?""

""We have, your honor,"" the forewoman answered firmly.  

""On the count of second-degree murder, how do you find the defendant?""

""We, the jury, find Matthew Berger, guilty as charged.""  The air of the courtroom filled with the expected reactions.  Some cheered, others murmured, and the defendant's contingent of family and friends responded with a combination of shock, outrage, and solemn acceptance.  

""Very well,"" the judge stated rather nonchalantly as he rifled through his papers. ""Mr. Berger, in accordance with the Just Sentencing Act, you are hereby sentenced to four years in the state penitentiary, less time served.""  He paused before reading the length of the defendant's sentence, clearly searching until he found the information on the papers in front of him.  This required no deliberation on his part.  The judge had no more say in the length of the sentence than the members of the jury or anyone else in the courtroom.

""Four years?  Four years...""  Jeremy muttered under his breath.  The judge banged his gavel repeatedly, signaling to Jeremy that there was nothing left to be heard.  Not that he expected any further information, as he understood how sentencing worked these days.  At least, he understood as well as the rest of the general public did.

Plenty of theories existed regarding how the sentences were determined, but hardly anyone actually knew the reality.  The very identity of the select individuals with the truth bordered on a national secret.  Regardless, the science or fortune-telling or whatever else came up with these numbers was substantial enough for it to become law.

Naturally, outrage ensued.  Beyond the question of whether or not justice was achieved by sending a killer to jail for how long the victim would have otherwise lived, the numbers were constantly questioned.  Autopsies and investigations were demanded by grieving families thinking the loss of their loved ones demanded considerably harsher prison sentences.   Delving deeper, however, almost always revealed an explanation.  An unknown heart condition, a threatening tumor, a hidden addiction or serious psychological illness.  Even when no obvious future cause of death appeared, the possibility of a deadly accident or another murder remained.  And the public began contesting the length of the prison sentences less and less.

None of this mattered to Jeremy presently.  Only two words echoed in his head: four years.  He exited the courthouse, failing to notice the brisk, spring breeze or birds merrily chirping.  Jeremy had his answer.  He had four years to live.  

The concept of his mortality had recently driven Jeremy mad.  In his youth, he was always curious about how long he had to accomplish all of his goals, but the curiosity became an obsession after his father's sudden death.  A brain aneurysm at 53.  

In the last year, Jeremy had countless medical exams performed when he seemed in perfect health.  He ate well, exercised religiously, and swore off anything that posed a serious threat to his health.  Eventually, Jeremy lost focus as to what he was worried about living for, and only longevity seemed important.  

The thought was fleeting, but Jeremy felt vaguely relieved that Matt's sentence wouldn't last terribly long.  That wasn't a major concern, though.  Matt was collateral damage.  A means to an end.  Perhaps if he had been a better neighbor, Jeremy would have chosen another patsy to frame for a murder that never happened.  Matt served his purpose; Jeremy had obtained the answer he had been seeking for so long, but not the answer he wanted.

At the crosswalk outside the courthouse, Jeremy simply stood, staring at nothing in particular.  He paid no mind to the signal alerting him that he was free to cross the intersection.  

Jeremy finally knew the answer to the question that had driven his decisions for as long as he could remember.  Almost out of necessity, he formulated a new question to replace his insatiable curiosity of how long he had to live.  A question he suddenly seemed completely incapable of addressing.

Even so, I had been practicing as an AoM for 30 years when I met with Mr. Dawson and had yet to sit through a MLOC hearing.  
Mr. Dawson's case seemed simple enough from the outset-he was suffering from Multiple Sclerosis and his disease had progressed to the point where he could no longer walk or speak.  Each bodily function like a light in a house as you make your way to bed, clicked off one-by-one with an end result of a peaceful, purposeful darkness.  His body was shutting down and eventually his breathing would fail, the last light before bed, ultimately suffocating him.
We had conversations during his last few hours, though he was unable to speak.  I was sure I didn't need to hear the words forming in his mind to understand, as an Angel of Mercy I understood the subtle changes in one's brow, the corners of the lips, to know what Mr. Dawson was saying.  I was certain when I administered his final medication that I understood his plea.  
""Traumatic paralysis.""  Judge Leahy interjected, ""Are you familiar with this condition, Nurse Saunders?""  
""Yes sir, I understand that this psychological condition arises from severe emotional or physical trauma and can render a patient unable to control normal motor and speech functions.""  I wasn't certain what Judge Leahy intended to solve by bringing this up, but my nerves got the best of me and my education did the rest, bringing to mind instantly the textbook definition of what was questioned.
""Did Mr. Dawson ask you to end his life?""  the Judge asked bluntly.
""Yes sir, Mr. Dawson and I became very close and he expressed to me that he was ready to end his life.""  I became very nervous but held true to the research I had put into this case and the honesty with which I had felt Mr. Dawson's answers.  With the symptoms that Mr. Dawson showed, I know that he could not have been more than a day from death's door.
""Mr. Saunders do you realize that the MLOC report conclusively determined that Mr. Dawson would have lived for 4 more years?""  There was a stunned silence in the courtroom.  MLOC hearings were primarily attended by medical professionals and my official opinion had been that the advanced stage of MS, confirmed by lack of motor as well as speech function indicated that the quality of life experienced by Mr. Dawson would never recover to his desired state.  In the state I found him in, I was prepared to accept all cries for help.
""Your Honor I don't think that..""  I stumbled.
""Did you look at the recent family history for this patient, Nurse Saunders?""  
""I did not, Your Honor.  This patient has been in my care previously and his disease has clearly entered an advanced stage.  I believe that I followed the best course of action.""  I had to stand firm with my assessment, the possibility that I misjudged the situation began to make me ill.
""Nurse Saunders, it is the official decision of the Medico-Legal Oversight Committee that Mr. Dawson would have survived for approximately four years after your mercy diagnosis.  Because of these findings it is my duty to ensure that you pay for the time lost.  You will be incarcerated at the facility house at...""
Leahy's voice trailed off in my mind, I didn't hear a word of my formal sentence.  
I made a mistake.  I always thought that I might have one of the most important jobs in the world-making the decision when death is the best alternative, more comfortable, more rational than continuing to live.  The MLOC has data to backup how long we would survive without intervention and I shortened a man's life by 4 years.  
Mr. Dawson's family experienced a grave hardship the week before he passed.  The loss of his daughter made him unable to speak and unable to respond to the normal motions we went through every day.  His painful expressions were forged by grief and not by disability.  I cannot help but think that if we are to be entrusted with the Industry of Mercy, that we must continue to look at every aspect of a patient's life as well as what they wish for their experience.  I will not soon forget my next four years behind these doors and my only offering is that I will emerge as a ready advocate and champion of those who seek the Angels of Mercy.

I know I should be afraid, or at least nervous but to be honest I am looking forward to going back to prison. Life was tough on the outside. Work was impossible to find for an ex con with a lingering heroine habit picked up on the inside, so I had found myself on the streets. When my welfare had been cut off for my continued drug use I had gotten desperate. 

Coming down from a drug stupor the idea had seemed so straight forward, kill some-one young enough and go back to jail for the rest of my life. No more need to eat from dumpsters or do horrible things to get my next hit. The government would provide me with regular meals and drugs were much easier to obtain inside, all I needed was an appropriate victim. When that young girl, fresh out of high school and probably in the big city for the first time, took a wrong turn down the alley he was currently lying it, he acted without a second thought. Sure he felt bad for the girl, she didn't deserve to die, but life is cruel and have to do what you have to do. So here he was, 3 months later after pleading guilty to the murder as quickly as possible, waiting to hear his sentence. 

The judge adjusted his glasses and looked at the paper in front of him. He looked confused for a second before clearing his throat and continuing ""The defendant has admited guilt in this case and is to be sentenced for the Murder of Isobelle Frew.

"[WP]If you murder someone, your jail sentence is as long as their remaining life would have been.",retrac101,"A lawyer, young and well dressed, stands in front of a jury and paces for a couple of seconds before he adjusts his glasses and starts to speak. 

""Alfred Benson is a name synonymous with murder. Called the most successful serial killer in history and the most efficient with 395 confirmed kills, 210 days in prison. He has often confessed to the crimes and served his time. But, not this time. Why? Because his victim today had another 8 years of life to live. We all know it wouldn't have been pretty if Fred's mom had lived those 8 years with dementia, but this is the world we live in.  Freddy Benson does not offer a defense that he put his mother out of her misery to save her the heartache of losing her memories or herself. No, he claims he did not do it. That he was framed, but this is a man with a long history whose finger prints were found on the gun, his gun. This man is a monster who cannot resist killing even his own mother. Do the world a service and find this man guilty. The prosecution rests."" 

The lawyer sits down and lets the defense offer their closing argument. Benson's lawyer is small and a bit disheveled in dress. He stands and speaks immediately. 

""Yes, my client's prints were found on the gun, but forensic testing proved that he did not fire that gun that day. And yes, my client is a serial killer, but in the sense that he saves people some pain, ends their misery a bit early. This type of murder that he is on trial for is not his MO. He poisons his victims. The gun is for defense, and that is the reasonable doubt right there. So many people wanted this man dead or to take the fall for a true life sentence. Mr. Benson's mother was living with him at his request. He loved her. He doted on her. This does not fit at all with the Mr. Benson's previous crimes. It does not fit, so you must acquit. Thank you."" 

The lawyer sits down and the jury deliberates. They return in a few minutes. The courtroom stands. The foreman reads the verdict. 

""We find the defendant guilty."" 

Freddy had heard this so many times, but this time was different. He was innocent, but he had many enemies. Still, it was only 8 years. He was big, tough, and smart. He would be fine. He just wish he knew who had set him up and killed his mom. If he didn't know any better, he would have guessed it was the lead prosecutor himself. 

***

The prosecutor talks to the press and heads to his car. He turns the ignition and lets it warm up for a few minutes. His mother in law would be proud, well, ex-mother in law. He still admired the woman and was so angry when Benson killed her. It was his ex who had finished Benson's mother, but he helped as much as he could. He knew Benson would pick up the gun. He figured it would be enough, but he was overjoyed when he was assigned the case. Eight years still wasn't enough, but it was something. Yeah, Benson would be done for a while and maybe even change his ways, be a reformed man. Or, better yet, die in prison. Either way, justice had been served. The most notorious serial killer in history was behind bars and, ironically, it was for a crime he didn't commit. He can't help but smile at that.

"[WP]If you murder someone, your jail sentence is as long as their remaining life would have been.",retrac101,"I was being transferred to the highest security prison in the world, located in Rome. Rumour was there was a inmate in there that had been there for eternity. But then again, there was always a new rumour. I heard one the other day about an infant being raised in a prison because his mother died at birth, but it was different because when he killed the mother on the way out. I'm not entirely sure, my point is that there's always some other bullshit story coming from inside there, usually the guards. That was until my cell block was right next door to this one really old looking guy. I figured he must have killed some young girl or something, like I did. Over time, I started to figure might as well have someone to talk to. I asked a few times why he was in here, but he would always end the conversation whenever I did. He also never told me his name, and whenever i asked i never got told. That was until one day we were all having our visits. I sat down, and noticed across the room, he was there. I asked him who he was meeting, and he said ""my family died a long time ago. This is my mental check up, every 100 years""

*what?* I thought, *did he say 100 years? that's not possible, is it?*

Then, his psychiatrist walked in and sat down, and as I hopped up to go and see my family, I heard what the psych said. I turned back around to see him looking at me, and he only nodded. For the rest of the day I couldn't think straight. I couldn't even concentrate on seeing my wife and daughter. This ""man"" had killed, quite possibly, the most important figure, and I knew for sure the rumours were true. This man would be in the prison for eternity.

But now all the papers, all the internet, all the ***world*** was buzzing with my discovery. It was a simple theorem, really. just another dissertation crafted in the time honored tradition of cleverness inspired by laziness. Forty-two pages, of which slightly less than three and a quarter were citations, a tautology thrown in for good measure, and now, here I stand..or sit, rather.

I had spent the previous week avoiding the news, it would seem as though I had cured cancer or figured out an electric rocket. even on the way here, I had to duck and dive and dodge the fevered people in borderline hysterics. Now, the chair was sparse but very supple; I couldn't tell if it was from abundance or lack or visitors. It squeaked weakly as I tried to get comfortable. The professor's and gathered luminaries were all hushed tones, occasionally throwing an eyeful of daggers at the photographers dim enough to use their flash. I had been sat here for hours and I cleared my throat more out of frustration than necessity.

A bald head barely looked up. ""You're aware of the gravity of your paper?"" He asked while scribbling a note that was passed down the seated row of professors.

""Yes, I am aware."" What were they on about? I had simply done what so many had argued before me, but with a dash of bravado and elegance, I must admit. But the attention it garnered was nothing less than sensational. I remembered the story of the man from a fee years ago. Butchered an entire school mainly composed of kindergartners; technology ensures he'll be serving out his sentence even when my descendants generations removed die under the light of an alien star. And that had been on the social conscious a total of an afternoon.

""Then, if you would, please proceed with your defense of your thesis, and for the assembled, start with your title.""

That's fucking odd, but I'm hungry and have things to do after this. I cleared my throat again before beginning, ""God is Dead, and This is How I Murdered Him."" In the privacy of my rooms, I had thought the title was amazing after the exhaustion had given way to delirium, but in the presence of so many people, I felt a blush creep up my neck to my face and spread across my chest. 

I could barely hear the gasps as I started to feel the chair, I knew that 845 candidates had defended their theses from this seat, of which 843 were successful, one whom just died in Madagascar this morning under the branches of a boab tree. His name was Gerry, and he was the second cousin thrice removed of my proctor, and I had a middling relation to him from a lustful spice trader a couple hundred years ago. I could feel the hushed awe as I spread into every crevice and neuron present, fixated myself in the eternities between Planck times, and felt all the cumulative emotions of billions year dead civilizations. Fifty six of which had made it here, and nine which had been side by side with us for generations.

I was everything, I saw everything, I knew everything, and as I inhaled ever more and reached out forward and backward through time, I remembered my thesis, that inspired proof that proved without a doubt God couldn't exist, that I couldn't exist, and as it were, I was Not.",claudemarley
"[WP]If you murder someone, your jail sentence is as long as their remaining life would have been.",retrac101,"""This is an arbitration on the matter of the untimely death of Gertrude of Olafsson.  The wounded party, Harold Olafsson, calls for the return of proportionality as compensation for his losses.  His accusation is on Jord Eriksson, who he purports to have contrived to cause the death of Gertrude of Olafsson.""

The arbitrator, Wise White Wilhelm, so named for his silver hair and his extensive knowledge of the Laws, paused momentarily as though to draw breath.  This should be a simple case - the laws were so clear on this that his latest apprentice and grandson, Little Leif, should have been able to arbitrate - but somehow, Jord's extreme confidence had gave him pause.

Something wasn't right.  He knew Jord too well - the man might be lazy and carefree, but he was deadly smart.  Jord knew something he didn't - but what?  Little Leif, who doubled as his clerk, was beginning to stare in worry.  He couldn't set aside the procedures, not this time - this was meant to be Leif's first experience of an Arbitration.  He couldn't make a mess of it in front of Little Leif.

No, he had decided.  He would proceed as he had always done, and he'd clear the silence by a pat on his chest; they knew he'd been developing a heart problem for a year or so.

""Ahem.  By ancient laws ordained to us by the Dual Gods of Order and Balance, we shall now hear both sides.""

""No need for that, old man.""  Jord grinned.  ""It's all true.  Well, mostly, anyways.""

Wilhelm spared a quick glance at Harold Olafsson that made him wince; he swore he could hear the man's teeth grind in his skull.

""Regardless, as Arbitrator, it is my responsibility to the two of you, to the lands, and to our ancestors before us to know the matter as clearly as I may before I arbitrate - and it is only fair that I hear you both on this matter.""

""Oh, come on, old man.  Everyone in this village and the next one ten miles over knows about what happened by now.  Stuff your old customs and move on.""

Wilhelm considered the offer.  It would be unusual; but not without precedent.  He could, in fact, take his words as an admission of guilt right then and there - an immediate admission of guilt had, after all, bypassed the need for the examination and explanation of evidence multiple times before, most notably in the Arbitration of the Bear Mountain Shepherds.  All he needed was the consent of Harold to make it official.

""Very well.  The accused waives his rights to be heard, and readily admits to his crimes.  Harold Olafsson, I ask of you - are you willing to entrust that the Arbitrator has heard you truly and fairly, and that his judgement in this case is sound, such that the confession of Jord Eriksson is sufficient basis for Arbitration?""

""Aye.""  Harold's voice was different.  In two sleepless nights, he seemed to have become a changed man - gone was the friendly smile and his roaring laugh that suffused the village tavern with enthusiasm - instead, all that was left of his roaring voice was a low, solemn drawl that rivalled Wilhelm's own.

""By the laws of the land passed down to us by ancient customs, Jord Eriksson is deemed to have murdered Gertrude of Olafsson.  As according to the will of the Gods and the heart of the land, Jord is to be sentenced to imprisonment - for as long as his victim would have lived otherwise.""

""Perfectly fine with that.""

The arbitrator's puffy white eyebrows seemed to leap onto his wrinkled forehead.

""Gertrude was yet to see her fifth Summer.  We have every reason to believe that she would have lived up to and beyond a healthy age of sixty-two - my age, in fact - which is why you are sentenced to fifty-eight years of imprisonment.  The village should not expect to see you a free man ever again.""

""Wait.  Hold up.""

""I'm afraid this arbitration is over, Jord Eriksson.  You have admitted yourself to being guilty of murder.""

""Well, no, ain't never said I'd deny that.  It's just the sentencing, you see.""

""As according to custom...""

""No, about that.  I have very good reason to believe, in fact, that Gertrude would not have lived beyond a week, even without my intervention.""  Jord grinned lazily.  ""You see, old man; the knife to the heart wasn't what did her in worst.  She'd also lost all her limbs, remember?""

Wilhelm swiftly raised his hand as Harold swayed, teetering, on the brink of charging towards Jord; He'd swear that Harold's bloodshot eyes would pop out of their skull if he so much as thunked him on the back of the head.

""I don't think anyone would soon forget, Jord.  And that's why you deserve that sentence - and though I've never said this before, I'll say it now, I think the Gods' laws are letting you off too lightly for my taste.""

""Things is, old man.""  Jord continued, ignoring the elderly arbitrator.  ""I didn't saw 'em off afterwards like you thought.  She's alive when I did it.""

This time, Wilhelm was too stunned to react as Harold, with a bear-like fury, charged across the room into Jord's face, fist ending barely a hair away from smashing his smug face into the wall.

""I knew you'd never have the guts for it, Harold.  You were always too nice for that.  Give up the theatrics.""  Jord chuckled lightly as Harold began to sob uncontrollably.

""Don't you see now, old man?  When I murdered her, there was no way she'd have lived.  Not long, anyways.""

""You've just added a charge of grievous injury with intent to kill to your charge.""

""Old man.  To think I studied the laws under you.""  Jord snorted.  ""You know as well as I do a prisoner can't be tried twice for the same crimes.  You gave it a fancy name, too, didn't you?  Double Jeopardy, something along those lines?  The Arbitration is over, you said.""

Wilhelm's chair seemed to disappear under him.  Faintly, he was aware of Jord's laughter and oddly enough the distinct lack of scratching of pen on paper.  Grandpa, grandpa.  Had he fallen off his chair?  Harold had ran out of the room.  Darkness was seeping into his vision.

Faintly, the old man whispered into Leif's ear.  ""Promise me, Leif.  Promise me you'll read your books, and become a good arbitrator - and do what I failed to do.

""Put your own father back into the prison he should be in.  Promise me, Leif.  I'm so...""

"[WP]If you murder someone, your jail sentence is as long as their remaining life would have been.",retrac101,"I was about to be sentenced for my crime, surely receiving 30 or 40 years, but I didn't much care about that.  Instead, my mind drifted to how I got here.  I wasn't a murderer by nature.  I hated blood, and the only ""fight"" I had ever been in resulted in my being beaten without having thrown a punch.  I was not a violent man, but here I was, about to be sentenced for a murder that I was surely guilty of.

It all started when I started a new job.  My wife and I had been married for three years, and we were expecting our first child.  I found a job in my field, and it had insurance benefits, which I had never had before.  Everything seemed great, until my medical insurance and life insurance applications were denied.  This would have been unheard of a decade ago, but a new technology had been discovered about 25 years ago that was making its way into various parts of society: genetic lifetimes.

I don't understand the science very well, but it involves taking tissue samples, and something to do with that allows them to predict, within a reasonable accuracy, the day of someone's natural death.  1.7 billion deaths globally since that discovery has only served to prove out the science.  Modern estimates are accurate to within 72 hours.  It's used in many industries: hospitals use it to triage accidents, the justice system uses it for sentencing murderers, credit card companies use it for credit eligibility, and the life and medical insurance industries use it to determine eligibility.  People can be denied health or life insurance if they are going to die soon.

If you haven't figured it out by now, I was ineligible for insurance due to my impending death.  Two years, a few months, and some days, the document said.  The details are unimportant.  I quit the job so I could spend time with my wife, and the company's HR department looked relieved.  Legally, death date information was supposed to be private to prevent discrimination: you didn't even know your own death date.  There's no way they should have known the date of my death, but they did know that I had been denied life and medical coverage, which all but spelled it out for them.  I briefly wondered how many people knew I was going to die, before moving on to dealing with the more important fact that I was dying.  I went home, told my wife, and we both cried.  A lot.

We saw doctors, of course, and all of them said there was nothing they could do.  Some took a look at my death date and cause of death and simply refused to see us altogether.  When I came to the realization that I would likely suffer a slow and horrible death, I got a call.  The person on the phone wanted to help.  Legally, they would providing me and my family with life insurance, medical insurance, and were buying my body ""for science"" when I died.  This amounted to about $2 million.  All I had to do was kill a man.

The task was laid out for me; all I had to do was execute it.  I poured poison into a man's drink, tried to escape capture for a few days, and then endured a short trial.  By the time it was all done, it was obvious that most of the people involved were complicit in the scheme.  It was simple, really: find people who are about to die and won't be able to leave behind anything for their survivors, and make them an offer.  As I stood in front of the judge and received a sentence decades long that I would only serve a few months of, I couldn't help but smile; my wife and child would be just fine.",godlyfrog

It had not been an easy case.  He flipped through the bookmarked sections: the index of character witnesses for a well-respected prosecutor, the psychiatric studies of trauma caused by premature terminations.  Mostly, it would come down to case law.

The judge returned from his chambers.  His black garb of fishnet and spandex seemed to encapsulate the stuffy dignity of ancient judicial proceedings while still providing a sense of stylish liberation.  But there was no liberation on his face as he gestured to the electrostatic drone gavel with three full fingers outstretched.  The exaggerated crash pronounced extra emphasis beyond silencing every phone by power of law.

""It is my ruling that Douglas Hanzel is to be held accountable for the three years and five months of his imprisonment.  Per *Hue vs. North Dakota*, his subsequent death ended this term.  However, the jury's finding of malicious prosecution implies that death would not otherwise have occurred.  The temporal resonance scanning implies that he would otherwise have survived for thirty-two years and fifteen days.  I find that this time, to be shared equally with Nu Color Redd, who committed the physical attack, may be immediately credited in this sentencing under the amended felony murder rule.""

Well, that was that, Jensen thought.  He considered making the grand and somewhat expensive gesture of tearing his folder, but then a thought crossed his mind.

""Your Yugeness, a point of inquiry.  What were the comparator settings?""

The judge returned, ""The decision to undertake the prosecution.""

""In the matter of *People vs. Benson*?""

""Of course.""

""But other cases will need to be retried as a result of this verdict.""

""Yes...""

""So Your Yugeness should compare the effect of all the prosecutions you hold invalid, not just this one?""

The judge gave his gavel just half a finger as he beat a retreat to chambers.  The grating tones of fourth-dimensional music ground through the gallery for long minutes as he delved deep into a flux of probabilities.

The judge returned.  Neglecting the gavel, he launched into speech.  ""My preliminary finding is that the failure to imprison Hanzel Defendant #131, I believe that's Rogers, leads to the premature death of Redd, which vitiates the attack.  Thus the additional time is waived, and we must apply only the three years and five months served.""

Of course, the prosecutor leapt to his feet demanding the eight years of the original sentence, and a full technical survey of the timeline...  It was going to be a long set of appeals.",Wikiwnt
"[WP]If you murder someone, your jail sentence is as long as their remaining life would have been.",retrac101,"The bars echo after they slammed closed behind him. He wore that same look on his face, as if burdened by somethin he knew that no one else did.

""How'd it go?""

""What'd I tell you?"" he huffs.

No one who gets over 25 years has a chance at getting parole. Over 50 years? Not a prayer. It had been my third night in, and tears stained the crotch of my government issued pants as I realized the next nine years of my life would be spent in one buildin. This buildin. With bars on the windows. Bars on the doors.

""How much longer you got left then?""

""Longer than I'll live to see.""

Poor bastard. Got locked up six months before some nerd out of Harvard figured out how to triple the human life span. Before prison began to be treated like rehabilitation again. Maybe that's why they keep him with me. You wouldn't think him dangerous if you saw him, even in his orange jumpsuit. The only one who shakes everyone's hand who comes near him, prisoner or not.

On his third night in, the man hoverin three feet above me he had 81 additional years weighing on his conscious. He slept like a baby. 

As for me, well, the judge may have wanted to make an example of me on the outside, but in here, fraud and identity theft are pretty lightweight offenses. Plus, it's easier to show good behavior if you commit a crime that only shows up on paper. I was looking at maybe eight years. Five if I was lucky.
At least that's what he told me.

""What'd you say to them?""

""Same thing I always say.""

""Not tryin to Monday mornin quarterback here, but if it hasn't worked the past three times, what makes you think it'd work now? I mean, it's hard enough for a murderer to get parole. A filicidal killer? Even harder.""

He sticks his head over the edge of the bed. His stare even more piercing upside down.

""I've been studying vocab for the SATs.""

He disappears again. Dust falls on my forehead as the mattress in front of me shuffles till he's comfortable.

""What'd you say to them?""

I roll over and pull my blanket over my shoulders. A cold wind cuts through the cells every night. If you kick off your covers while you sleep, you're bound to get sick at least once a month.

Maybe he'll tell me next time.

""My great grandfather grew up in a city called Leonding, back when it was still a part of Austria-Hungary. He fought in World War I. He witnessed World War II. He himself was not a bad man, but he lived among bad men. He saw what happens when the evil that exists in one person fuels the hatred in all others.

""I only remember visiting him once. It was in a big hospital. He cleared the room till it was just me and him. He stared at me in complete silence for five minutes before he smiled, tears in his eyes. There's good in you, he told me. The light overshadows the dark, and it's up to me to fight against the wicked. To rid the world of their toxic hate.

""My son was born with half of my blood, and the blood of my family. Blood that travels to countries for an wide throughout history. It runs through the veins of pure and evil men alike. On his 5th birthday, I took him to his bedroom. For hours I stared into his eyes, searching for hope. That light I had seen in my great grandfather's eyes. And my grandfather's eyes. And my mother's eyes.
""But I didn't find hope. Nor light. I found darkness. Hatred. An evil we pretend doesn't exist in this world. Everyday I look into the eyes of the men around here. Not for innocence, but for repentance. I haven't seen a more wicked heart than in that child.

"[WP]If you murder someone, your jail sentence is as long as their remaining life would have been.",retrac101,"This would be my sixth time in jail over the last 5 years. Ever since the new government implemented the ""time lost"" murder laws. I remember reading about it in the New York Times with keen interest. - ""A panel of experts will convene to determine the amount of time the deceased could reasonably expect to have enjoyed."" 

When I saw those words, ""reasonably expect"" I knew this was my golden ticket to what I had always wanted. To carry out my work with impunity to the fullest extent of my ability. 

For the last 20 years I had worked in a hospice. Taking care of the sick, decrepit wrinkly skin bags after their own children abandoned them. They were so weak, frail and pathetic that I started to despise them. Pity them really. I remember one lady, 93 years old. She would sit and stare with listless eyes while petting a stuffed tiger. She would call it ""Stacy."" We basically had to force food down her throat, she was so disinterested in the events of our physical world she didn't enjoy any of it. 

I slashed her throat with a steak knife. 

The mist of blood created a beautiful painting on the wall. I was an artist. For the first time in my life, I felt like I had accomplished something worthwhile. Because while she died, she looked me right in the eyes and tried to say something. All she could manage was a gurgle, but I know she was trying to say ""Thank You"" 

She was my first. Due to her condition, the panel of experts decided she only had 4 months left to live. They gave me half of that, if I paid a fine. The fine was only equal to about 2 weeks  wages, so it was a cheap price to get me back out of that prison. 

Not that prison was all that bad. The new government had also decided that access to internet was a basic human right, so everyone in prison just sat around on forums, or playing video games. It's a place I could get used to. 

But I never had to stay there for long. 2 months for the first one. 1 for the second. 3 for the third. Only two short days for the fourth. Which was my most glorious act yet. I put on a show for the other doomed fools in the hospice using the head of old Mr. McIntyre. He was a puppet in a grotesque re-enactment of our last election. They cackled and pointed... fully knowing it was the head of one of their companions who I had just murdered. They didn't care. They just wanted their turn to come sooner. 

The fifth got me 3 months, it would've been a year, but I changed the medical records so it looked like he had gotten his terminal cancer diagnosis 9 months before he did. 

I have to admit, I was quite surprised when I was re-hired after leaving prison the first time, at the same facility where I had just viciously murdered an old grandma with a steak knife. 

But the other employees sort of idolized me. They looked at me with wide eyes, and sometimes asked me in hushed tones ""What was it like?"" 

They all wanted the boldness that I had. The freedom to do what we all thought was necessary. But they lacked the courage to follow through. So I became their hero, in a twisted way. Which is why my manager was happy to hire me back. After the 4th one he even said ""Congratulations! That was spectacular work."" 

I heard that some photos of my ""crimes"" had been posted online along with stories explaining what I did. I found that sort of sickening in a sense. I never wanted to do this for the attention, I didn't want to be a celebrity serial killer, I only wanted to put some old people out of their misery. 

Which is why this killing was different. I don't know what inspired it... I guess I just felt like I had to do SOMETHING to escape the prison I was building for myself. I didn't trust myself not to kill again, it was an addiction... so I had to do something drastic. 

It all started when the hospice decided to let an orphanage come in and ""cheer up the dying""... dozens of little children ran in. They played with our medical equipment, and talked with the old people. I have to admit, in the normally lifeless existence of the hospice it was nice to see a spark of life. But it wasn't going to last. 

I found one of them alone, she had gotten lost and wandered into the staff area. Cute little girl, blonde hair, green eyes, about 7 years old with one front tooth missing. 

She said ""Hi, My name's Sarah, what's your name?"" 

In that moment... something came over me. I wondered if she would bleed differently than an old person. Her veins were so young and tight, I'm sure it would spray more. 

I grabbed a knife and plunged it into her chest. Once. Twice. Three times. 

She didn't look grateful. 

She looked sad. 

Like I had stolen something from her that wasn't mine to take. 

I collapsed on the ground, shivering, crying. 

I called out for help. Once. Twice. Three times. 

The manager came rushing in... he didn't look impressed. 

He looked horrified. 

""WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!"" he shrieked... 

I just pointed, blubbered and cried. 

That day, it wasn't Sarah that died... it was me. And now I sat expecting an 80 year sentence I just hoped it would go quickly so I could finally rest. 

The judge came out. Said that a man had become a hero, and then a hero had become a monster. He said what I had done was despicable and deserved to be punished by the full brunt of the law. 

However... the new government had enacted a new law just yesterday, which stated the maximum sentence for any crime was to be 5 years. After which point so many of the cells in one's body had replaced themselves, you were technically a new person. 

With a sigh, and a bang of his gavel, the judge put me away for 5 years. To go to a playground with other adult children, and discover my new fanbase online... a fanbase I never wanted, but now that I had it... I wanted to make them proud.

A gasp was let out in the court room, we all breathed a little slower for those first 15 minutes. My ears began to ring, I froze.

jury, not, guilty, the jury, We, jury, guilty, defendant, guilty, not, not guilty..

the person who broke into my little sister's bedroom last year and beat her to death as her bed was slide up against the door was found not guilty.

my heart raced, tears stream down my face. I wanted to do nothing more than to punch this lady in the mouth.. a monster.. no.. that would be an insult to monsters.

I wanted to jump over those wooden panels and choke her.. she began smirking after she heard the verdict.. that evil smile.

I wanted to.. but I wasn't brave enough. Just like I didn't have the balls to take a chance and shoot through the door as I heard my sister crying out for help.. I didn't want to accidentally shoot my sister, so me, my mom and brother all kicked and beat on the door.

Little would I much to my heartbreak find out I played a part in killing her. If I would've shot just 3 bullets from that .357 she might still be here.

Gun powder and smoke would fill the room and like a cloud of fog would bring about peace.. sweet sweet peace. Justice. 

my mom just squeezed onto me.. meanwhile I couldn't breathe but I knew she meant well. Here I am almost a grown man crying into my mom's shoulder.

My uncle who is usually not very affectionate just hugged us both and in a calm tone began to ""Shhh"" ""It's gonna be alright"" ""Stay strong"" and ""She likes to see us hurt, pick your heads up"" us.

our lawyer just looked at my dad and shook her head as if to say 'that was it'. As if to say she couldn't do anything else.

"[WP]If you murder someone, your jail sentence is as long as their remaining life would have been.",retrac101,"Marianna had quite the track record. She had over 10 counts of robbery and had been an attendant to at least 25 drug deals. This was her first count of murder, so of course she screwed herself.

She dumped the pistol she used in a river, without swiping the damn thing of her prints. The pistol ultimately made it's way back to the city, and was picked up by an elderly woman, who did the ""correct thing"" in handing it into the cops. 48 hours later, there she was, in a stuffy courtroom, listening to the Honorable judge introduce the case.

The poor kid had it coming. Ronnie knew what would happen to him if he broke one of Gibson's rules. The kid ratted on a few of Gibson's latest recruits, who were now sitting in a jail cell somewhere, probably crying because they knew that the moment they got out, they would get the crap beaten out of them. Marianna did what Gibson had ordered her to do. Did she like what she did? No. Will she get over it? Eventually, yeah.

Finally, the judge spoke to her.

""Miss Marianna Vasquez, you are charged for the murder of Ronald ""Ronnie"" Bennett. How do you plead?""

""Guilty, Your Honor. No point in me denying it"", she spoke slyly.

She could feel her lawyer shaking his head beside her. She didn't care. She had done time before. Beside, this new government system was a cakewalk. The poor kid was involved in a street gang. He wasn't going to last that long, even if Marianna hadn't killed him.

""Very well"", the judge spoke clearly, and began to stifle through his file.

""This court sentences you to 5 years in prison. Case dismissed. Take Miss Vasquez away, please"".

Marianna was filled with shock and horror, and couldn't stop herself.

""Hey, you're lying! No way would he have lasted that long - he was a weak snitch!"" She shouted aggressively, standing up whilst doing so.

Two large guards grabbed her, to stop her from doing any harm to herself or anyone around her. 

The judge raised himself slowly from his chair before speaking to her.

""My file tells me otherwise, Miss Vasquez. Enjoy your 5 years in prison."" 

And with that, the honorable judge left the courtroom, leaving Marianna seething with rage.

Finally the room came into focus. I stood in the middle of a large white room, the ceiling stood high, almost 40 feet. Despite its massive size, the walls were empty, and the room was bare, save for a small, black wooden desk standing directly in front of me. Behind this desk sat a man wearing a black suit with a black tie. He was a blank faced man, with black eyes and black matted down hair that seemed to press deeply into his scalp. There the man sat for what seemed like minutes, leafing through a stack of papers. Finally he pulled out a singular piece of paper, and spoke my name. 


""Yes...yes that's me"" I said, remembering. 


The man continued to stare at the paper, resuming in his droll, monotonous voice.

 
""And do you know why it is you are here?"" 


I tried to remember. Everything was fuzzy. I shook my head. 


The man nodded. ""Then we shall wait"". 


Wait? Wait for what? I was becoming annoyed. Annoyed because I didn't know where I was, or why I was here. I wanted to leave, but felt myself rooted in place. Nothing strapped me down, but when I tried to move, I could not. Suddenly I heard a whisper, and when I turned, I saw the brief flash of a little girl wearing a green dress with yellow shoes. Suddenly she was gone. Another whisper....I turned to see a middle aged man with horn rimmed glasses and a tophat, laughing as he greeted the young girl before again they both disappeared. Gradually, the room began to flood with whisper after whisper, as more people, young and old, began to appear and disappear. A medical student. Two lovers, hand in hand. An old man, an actress, a row of children. And then, suddenly, it came back to me. The blinding rage. 


I burned these people. Flooded them with chemicals. Filled them with bullets. And not only them, but millions more. I remembered who I was now. The chambers, the camps, the soldiers....and my people, looking up from below, arms raised, begging me for an answer. This was my life's work. To raise my country from the ashes. To rid the earth of the scourge that plagued it. I needed to get back. I needed to resume. 


The people disappeared, as quickly as they had came. I looked toward the man behind the desk. He seemed to recognize the fire burning in my eyes. 


""So now you remember"" he said. 


I nodded. 


The man opened a drawer in the desk and pulled out a lighter. As he set the corner of the paper on fire, a sudden dread took over me. My skin began to feel warm, then hot, then unbearable. As the fire overtook the page, I looked down and saw that my skin was burning, melting. I tried to scream but no words came out. The last thing I saw was cold, blank eyes of the man behind the desk.

After the night was over, the first drum

the chat was still available so it lit up instantly:

zzRgrizz: bruh

OpTiC NadeShoT: LMFAOOOOOO

iNNgamer: this shit cant be realloololololololol

longdick1: stfu guys i'm from russia servers is shitty

longdick1 disconnected.


Suddenly 13/24 players were left, that was until the ""big teams"" like FaZe and OpTic, started taking care of the lone players by themselves, and getting rid of the weak ones. Using their pro game sense they were able to eliminate a few players who were leaving tracks.

22.zeMf 0 kills 1 death

23.fortKn0x 0 kills 1 death

24.longdick1 -1 kills 1 deaths

To cut you the pain of reading the whole scoreboard, the players left alive are named these:

zzRgrizz

FaZe KiLL4WiN

FaZe epikk

OpTiC NadeShoT

OpTiC opensource

HaCkER

iNNgamer

listed by their place on the scoreboard.

This was end game, and only one player can win a free for all. You could hear the chat on twitch.tv getting absolutely insane as the sun started shining, FaZe players have built a base around the middle, zzRgrizz was out hunting solo, being sure he was the best player in the world. OpTiC opensource and NaDeShoT were spying on FaZe, looking to overtake their baze. iNNgamer was nowhere to be found, and HaCkeR was spying on both FaZe and OptiC from the distance.

Finally, OpTiC decided to strike.

OpTiC opensource (bow and arrow) FaZe KiLL4WiN

FaZe epik (landmine) OpTiC NaDeShoT

OpTiC NaDeShoT disconnected.

FaZe KiLL4WiN disconnected.

HaCkeR attemted to steal some supplies, as FaZe epik took a shot at him.

OpTiC opensource (bow and arrow) FaZe epik

""This shit will bite you in the ass bro"" FaZe epik sighted as he alt+f4ed

FaZe epik disconnected.

""Go, run, next time I won't save you."" OpTiC opensource sprouted at HaCkeR, and she did just that. She was determined now more than ever to look for the boy from her district, iNNgamer.

After the 3 kills in this day, the people left alive were:

zzRgrizz 5 kills 0 deaths

OpTiC opensource 4 kills 0 deaths

HaCkER 0 kills 0 deaths

iNNgamer 0 kills 0 deaths

The next day, zzRgrizz knew OpTiC opensource was in the middle, and he knew if he killed him, he pretty much had the win. So that's exactly what he did. He went for the kill, opensource noticed him, and after around 5 minutes of hide and seek zzRgrizz emerged with the kill.

zzRgrizz (shuriken) OpTiC opensource.

OpTiC opensource disconnected.
But on the other side of the map a partnership was created as HaCkeR managed to find where the guy from his team was camping, and after they got a sponsored care package from Steelseries, they were off to the middle, to kill zzRgrizz.

As they were approaching the middle, suddenly a fog rose, and loud, menacing barks emerged.

K9 unit deployed (6 kills killstreak)

""Deal with this shit motherfucker"" zzRgrizz screamed at the top of his lungs

As HaCkeR and iNNgamer entered the middle, they saw him, with all sorts of weaponery, capable of easily beating them, standing on top of the rock in the middle.

""I will win, nothing can stop me now!!"" He yelled, almost like an evil villain. 

zzRgrizz timed out.

HackeR: lmfao ahahahahahahaha

iNNgamer: AHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHA NO WAY

""So... I guess we win."" iNNgamer stated. ""Thanks for looking for me out there.""

""NOT YET"" A voice from the sky echoed ""ONLY ONE PLAYER CAN BE LEFT ALIVE""

""But..."" 

""NO BUTS, THIS GAME HAS RULES.""

""iNN... we can't... i can't see you go...."" HaCkeR sighed

""HaCkeR... i have an idea... let's both disconnect at the same time...""

""Oh shit you're a genius let's do that lol"" 

""WAIT, OK, YOU BOTH WIN YOU FUCKING CUNT NOOBS""

The twitch chat exploded into a thousand ""gg's"" and ""wtfs"" and Kappas as the game ended. As twitch calmed down and people started leaving, HaCkeR and iNNgamer knew that they changed history. And that their hope will give all the people of CoD hope... a movement was about to rise, that would throw ActivisioN of... and let people live a normal life.

Unfortunately for them, they seem to have forgotten that even if the CoD fanbase wanted to do something about it, their parents wouldn't have allowed it, and so Hunger Games Free For All No Respawn deathmatches continued for about a year, until the release of Hunger Games: Infinite Warfare, which was without a doubt the shitties Hunger Games yet, people stopped watching, and ActivisioN turned out broke. 

What will be the next in gaming, nobody knows, but everybody, who was old enough to watch the 74th hunger games, has to agree that it was the most epic hunger games yet, with two winners. The story of it will always be the top upvoted on the /r/CallOfDuty subreddit, and it epic proportions will never be forgotten. ",fuckyourdeadnan

"[WP] Instead of counting up, years count down. The reason has been lost to human history.",CisoSecond,"Have you ever wondered why clocks tick? I'm sure you did as a child, and probably got some answer that involved little gears and springs, but that's how it ticks. There's a difference between why and how, which humanity is yet to fully grasp, but I grasped it a long time ago.  
  
Tick.  
  
There are many ways to make a clock. Really, the ticking isn't strictly necessary. People just got *really* good at making clocks that ticked, and forgot how to make clocks that didn't. In fact, once upon a time, most clocks did not in fact, tick. Fortunately, humans are clever. Unfortunately, they some times forget that so were their ancestors.  
  
Tick.  
  
That of course, still doesn't answer the question of why a clock ticks. I do admire your ability to listen so patiently though. The ears were always my favorite sensory organ. The one sense that didn't care for physical boundaries; it has served humanity well throughout history. You can avoid a predators gaze, and stay downwind of your prey, but you can never truly not make a sound. It truly is your greatest protector. And if you use it right now, you'll hear your answer.  
  
Tick.  
  
There are no clocks in here my child.  
  
Tick.  
  
That sound is me.  
  
Tick.  
  
I am the reason the clock ticks.  
  
Tick.  
  
Imagine a nation of people, not as advanced as yours, but far more knowledgeable. You know them as the people who invented the calendar, but I knew them as my children. They may not have carried my blood, but they carried my stories. They did not trust me, but that was to be expected; they were no fools.  
  
Tick  
  
I taught them that every story has an ending and clever creatures that they were, they sought out the ending of their own. They came close, but it was ultimately because of a single man that they were able to discover the truth. Einar was a clever man.  
  
Tick.  
  
He created a calendar that counted down. They begged him to reveal how he was able predict the end so accurately, but he refused to tell. He almost took his secret to his grave, but in his dying moments, he relented. His explanation confused them at first, because he grasped something they did not. The difference between how and why.  
  
Tick.  
  
The hero defeats the villain; and that is *how* the story ends. The story must end so that the story teller can tell it; and that is *why* the story ends. While his people searched for the hero and the villain, Einar searched for the story teller, and he found him.  
  
Tick.  
  
Over and over, the story tellers shell is tested. One day, it will fail and shatter, but until then, it will continue to make the same sound over and over.  
  
Tick.  
  
Tick.  
  
Tick.  
  
Einar's calendar became their way of keeping track of that day, and clocks became their reminder to keep track.  
  
Tick.  
  
I am the story teller.  
  
Tick.  
  
I am the reason the clock ticks.

There was comottion in the hall. The nurse walked to the door and pushed slightly to hear better. 
""No!!"" A woman screamed. ""No! Check again! Please! Check again!"" A man with a white coat and light blue gloves walked out of the delivery room down the hall. Following him was a tired looking man in a flannel shirt. ""Please doctor! There has to be some kind of mistake! We didn't do anything wrong! The pregnancy was normal. We visited the doctor often, he assured us everything was fine! Do something!""
The doctor stopped,  in the hall. Looking down at his feet, one hand on his hip, one hand messaging his brow. He turned and looked up at the man, ""I'm sorry, I truly am. If there was anything I could do I would, but thats not my job."" He turned and left.
The tired flanneled man slumped to the side and leaned on the wall, turned so his back was flat with the wall and slumped down to the ground. 
Out of the delivery room the man and doctor emerged moments ago a male nurse appeared with a baby, securly wrapped in a blue blanket. He entered the the nursery where the female nurse still had her eye on the grieving man.

"[WP] Instead of counting up, years count down. The reason has been lost to human history.",CisoSecond,"It was just another day at the ShopMart for Billy.  He was stuck doing yet another overnight shift with James.  Billy didn’t even understand how James was able to function in society.  James put so little effort in his work that Billy wondered if he was even conscious at times.  He kept meaning to complain to his scheduling manager that James was incompetent and having him on the schedule so much was a terrible idea.

&amp;nbsp;

Billy was happy the store was slow, on account of everyone’s “end of the world” parties.  The world’s calendars had been long counting down, and historians everywhere had no idea why.  Years ago people started calling midnight on the 0th day of the calendar day Z.  Day Z was said to be the end of the world.  The world was going to end by alien invasion, God’s wrath on humanity, natural disaster, explosion of the sun, or numerous other half-baked theories.  Billy did not believe any of that nonsense about day Z.  Ancient people wouldn’t have known about the ways the world worked nearly well enough to predict such a spectacular end, especially when modern science can’t even predict anything special about Z day.  Many Historians believed the calendar to just be a circle, similar to the month system.  Once year zero ended, it would restart on whatever high number it started at before.  Much the same way that January turned into December every year.  World governments had long ago decided to just switch over to negative years.  It would make it easier for everyone.  Rather than “randomly” changing how the years count, it would continue on much the same way it always had.  There was no reason to change the year by a few thousand, and in any case no one knew what year the current system even started on.  

&amp;nbsp;


Billy looked at the clock on his register.  The time read 00:10, just ten minutes until the “end of the world”.  It also meant that Billy had another six hours before he could go home and laugh at all the idiots that actually made it the end of their world by blowing their life savings.  Billy looked up to see James approaching him, looking unusually alert.  A question that Billy was absolutely repulsed by after hearing it a thousand times came spewing out of James mouth “Hey Billy, do you suppose the end of the world is happening tonight?”  Billy sighed, then replied with “Do you think I would be working right now if I actually thought that?”  James got a confused look on his face before responding “Well I don’t know, maybe you just like working here”.  Billy just looked at James in disbelief, before exclaiming “What? Seriously!? You think I am working this job because I enjoy it?! Do you?! Why are you here?” James was a bit alarmed at Billy’s sudden outburst.  “Well I mean, they are the only people that would hire me” said James.  Billy sighed once again before saying “No, not working here.  I mean, tonight.”  James thought it over for a moment before responding “Well I mean I got scheduled to work tonight so  I had-“ the phone rang.

&amp;nbsp;

Billy stared at the phone.  Nearly every phone call they had gotten tonight were people asking if they were open, never mind the fact that the phone system played a message stating they were open before transferring the caller to the phones.  Billy picked up the phone with his normal greeting.  “Thank you for calling ShopMart North, this is Billy how may-“ A voice cut him off there shrieking “ARE YOU GUYS OPEN?!”  Billy knew he should have made a recording of himself earlier in the day saying this.  He was tired of saying the same thing constantly after just two hours into the shift.  “Yes Ma’am, we are open.  We are open 24/7 here at the Mart”.  The voice shrieked back “BUT WHAT IF IT IS THE END OF THE WORLD!? WHAT THEN!?”  Billy responded much the same as he had all night.  “Then I guess I made a mistake coming to work tonight.  Is there anything else I can-” the line went dead.  Billy shrugged and put the phone down.  He was going to be the happiest man alive when the clock struck 23:59 and the end of the world thing was all over.  At least as happy as he could be while working.

&amp;nbsp;

Billy looked over to James.  “What was that you were saying?”  James resumed “So anyway, I was scheduled to work so I had to come in.  I can’t be making my own hours, you know.”  Billy thought it over for a second and said to him “Fair enough, I suppose it-“ an elderly man came up to the register, cutting him off their conversation once again.

&amp;nbsp;

The man started putting his items on the belt and asked “You guys have any of them end of the world coupons for me to use?” Billy responded with “No sir, our store didn’t print any special Day Z coupons.”  The man was visibly annoyed and said “Well BuyCo across the street has day Z coupons! Can’t you honor those!? It isn’t fair I have to drive across the street to buy stuff” Billy hated this type of customer. He replied “Sorry sir, but while we do price match, we cannot honor other store coupons.  Corporate will not reimburse us for other coupons, so we would be taking a huge loss if we tried to redeem them”.  The man scowled and retorted “I WANT THE MANAGER! YOU ARE STEALING MY MONEY! THIS IS BULLSHIT!?”  Billy hated this job sometimes.  He told the man “None of the managers are currently in, but I am the Supervisor in charge for the night.  I am sorry you feel that way sir, but unfortunately we can’t take-“ The man threw the few items in his hand against the belt and screamed “I DON’T WANT IT THEN! TAKE IT ALL OFF! I’LL NEVER SHOP HERE AGAIN!” The elderly man then quickly walked out of the store.


&amp;nbsp;

Billy looked to James and said “I hate that guy.  I swear he does this every other week.  It seems rare that he actually buys anything here.  Help me put some of this stuff back.  I’ll get the stuff up on the front end so I can watch the door and phones, you stock the stuff in the back” 

&amp;nbsp;

Billy finished stocking everything then looked at his clock.  23:55.  Billy said out loud “Yep, only six more hours of this until I get to go home”

The inevitability of those minutes on that clock running down to zero had become a reality to the 16 billion human beings who inhabited the galaxy. For as long as man remembered they had been taught by their elders and religious leaders that they were all on a count down. Around the Terminus 2022 all religions on earth came to the realization that they all agreed upon one thing. The way that time was to be recorded back ward. From this realization rose a unified religion which quickly led to a unified world government which quickly lead to world peace and the pursuit of populating other planets... But there was 48 hours left and 16 billion people were starting to lose their shit. Within the first 8 hours the estimated planetary wide damage cost had risen to roughly five hundred billion dollars. The amount of interplanetary crime planet wide on Mars Earth and the Moon had risen by 23% 42% and 86% respectively within the final 24 and the people had taken to the streets to be with each other to celebrate without fear, no one went to work that day. The people that weren't out  on the streets were in a fervour hiding anywhere reinforced they could find hoping they would survive whatever happened at the end of time. ""10 minutes"" I thought as I lit a last cigarette staring out towards the moon wondering if someone up there was doing the same as me. The smoke filled my lungs with that familiar itch as I inhaled the cancer sticks with a distinct joy only an addict could have for something. It was funny how little people cared about their health in our society humans had reached a point of scientific perfection where the human body could be edited like the digital photos and as humans were a proud and fearful creature the human lifespan had been shortened to a ""manageable"" and ""efficient"" 50 years, reaching sexual, mental and physical maturity at age 5 and provided a residence and job at age 7. From another universes perspective being given a deadline had made the human race a very efficient one. Fear, however can be a stronger motivator than any seeming drive to succeed. We knew we were on a count down. I put the cigarette out and flicked it onto my neighbours lawn. ""Fuck it"" I thought as I stared out at the other people and families out on the street looking at the moon like I was. If you didn't know the world was ending the suburb I lived in wouldn't have given you a clue, seemingly untouched by the goings on of the world around us. All the street signs and houses were clean and intact. ""2 minutes"" I heard a man say to his wife as his kids drew with chalk in front of them on their driveway. None of us knew whether those drawings would be there within moments. Five, four, three, two... I missed the love of my life... One...

Silly kids. Silly, stupid kids.

There were three of them this time. Asian girl. Black girl. Irish-looking ginger kid. He always did like celebrating diversity. 

They all came from a halfway house in midtown. Junkie moms. MIA dads. Those are the easiest marks. And he's never been one to strain himself. 

Poor kids love tricks. They love the illusion. There was hardly any sport in it at all. But then, he'd never been one for sport. This was never a game to him. Just revenge. Anger. Madness.

Bloody insanity.

I visited the little mick first. He was always fluttering around, stirring up shit. He liked to play with kids, too. Just not the same way. It WAS a game for him. A chase. He never got caught. In his own way, he was just as deranged. He just had a little less blood on his hands.

""He's back, Lucky,"" I say. ""Tearing up kids again.""

""Come on now, Luck. You know what he does isn't good for you. He keeps this up, they're gonna start locking kids up at night. Walking them to school. Nothing for you to play with.""

""I'm not like that, alright? And there's nuthin' I know. He and I...we were never friends. I don't keep up wit' 'im. He...well, he always did scare me.""

""And what makes ye think I know any...""

""You know, I'm not above pretending I smell weed and kicking your door in right this minute. And I have a hunch you don't want me on the other side of that door.""

Lucky shook his head. ""Talk to the frog. They go way back.""

""And where's the frog?""

""Try the gutter."" The door slammed shut.

The frog wasn't in the gutter, but he wasn't doing much better. I found him pitching a fit at the clinic.

""It's my goddamn turn!"" he screamed, flipping over a wooden chair and kicking the reception desk.""My turn! I can't wait anymore! My turn!""

I grabbed him by the back of his thick neck and slammed him to the floor. 

""Dig, is that your inside voice?""

The frog thrashed. ""It's been so long. I'm tryin'. I'm tryin'. But how am I supposed to be good if they don't give me my medicine?""

I pulled Dig up to his feet. ""Walk with me. I can help you out.""

""You can't,"" said Dig'em, crying softly. ""You can't."" All the same, he let himself be led out of the room.

""I need the rabbit,"" I said once we'd exited out to the locking dock. ""He's at it again.""

""Don't know,"" said Dig through his tears. ""Why would I...""

I pulled a small box out of my coat. It was old. They didn't make his stuff anymore. I'd had to pull a few strings.

Dig's eyes lit up. ""Is that?""

I nodded, slipping the box back into my coat. ""The real stuff. Pure Smacks. What you've been dreamin' about all these years. And it's yours. If you get me the rabbit.""

Dig blinked. ""I...I probably shouldn't.""

I shrugged. ""Eh. Fine. I'll eat 'em myself. Bet they still taste great.""

""No! NO!"" Dig grabbed my coat. I shoved him aside easily. ""I'll help. You just...you have to make sure you get him. If you don't...and he finds out...""

""Give me something good, then.""

He gave me something great. Turns out, the rabbit had been living in the toucan's basement. I always knew that bird was a piece of shit.

I'm not an idiot, so I called in a SWAT unit. They smashed the place to hell. Even found pieces of the Life cereal kid down in the basement. But no rabbit.

They did find something else, though. May have been something, may have been nothing. But there it was, in a safe behind the TV - a blue captain's hat.

""What does it mean?"" asked the officer who brought me the hat.

""Means it's never over,"" I replied. ""And I have a feeling it's only going to get worse.""",WinsomeJesse

YOUR GREATEST OBLIGATION IS TO SERVE AT MY RIGHT SIDE. BESIDES, IT IS NOT AS THOUGH YOU ARE GOING TO CONTINUE PLAYING CLARINET IN COLLEGE.

""It looks good on my application!"" One of the demons rolled his eyes just slightly. ""And why are there so many damn demons here?""

LANGUAGE.

""Can I borrow mom's car at least?""

If my father was capable of looking wistful, that is how I would describe his face just then. SHE HAS GONE TO YOUR AUNT'S HOUSE. 

""What?"" I pushed through the crowd of demons and looked out the front window. My mother's car was not in the driveway. ""Why?""

THERE WAS A DISAGREEMENT. DO NOT WORRY. WE WILL BE FINE. ONCE THIS DAY HAS PAST, ALL WILL BE WELL. ALL WILL BE ENDED.

""Ended?"" It was at this moment I finally noticed the three golden dragons perched heavily on the Robinson's garage across the street. ""Did you see the dragons out here?""

SON, PLEASE. SET ASIDE YOUR CLARINET CASE AND COME TO ME. THERE IS MUCH I MUST TELL YOU.

I pulled myself away from the window. ""It's not just the applications, you know. Mrs. Grigg is probably going to write me a good recommendation.""

MRS. GRIGG WILL SOON BE FORCED TO CHOOSE ON WHICH SIDE SHE SHALL STAND. ALL WILL FACE THIS CHOICE. ONLY THOSE WHO CHOOSE WISELY WILL LIVE TO SEE ANOTHER SUNRISE. 

""That's fine,"" I said. ""But Mrs. Grigg has a friend in the admissions office at Cornell, so...""

INSTITUTIONS, LIKE ALL ELSE, WILL FALL AND RISE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR CHOICES. ONLY ONE SIDE WILL EMERGE VICTORIOUS.

""Well, I mean, I'm applying to a bunch of back-up schools, if you're worried about that.""

MICHAEL APPROACHES. WHEN HE ARRIVES THE NEXT PHASE SHALL BEGIN. I WISH FOR YOU TO BE READY.

""Michael who? Aunt Linda's Michael? Is he the one who got kicked out of fat camp for peeing in the cafeteria?""

NO. THIS IS A DIFFERENT MICHAEL. THIS IS THE ARCHANGEL. THE ENEMY. THE EMISSARY. HE IS THE ONE WE MUST DEFEAT IN ORDER TO GAIN FINAL DOMINION OVER THE WORLD.

""Oh."" I glanced around at the milling demons, gripping black scythes in their taloned hands. ""But when that's over, I can borrow the car?""

My father seemed to sigh. YES.

""Deal. Dibs on one of those dragons.""",WinsomeJesse

[WP] A man goes back in time to 1940's Germany to save the Toothbrush mustache.,DoctorSoda,"#The Mustache#

Adolf woke, squinting his swollen eye against the dim light of an oil lantern. He gave a low groan as his good eye scanned the room. There, in the darkness just beyond the lamplight, was his assistants silhouette. He heard the scraping of a blade against leather, accompanied by a dark, husky chuckle. 

""I haf no monay if zat is vat you ar lookink fur."" 

The figure turned to reveal a pale wisp of a man, so thin and small boned Adolf wondered how he'd ever been overpowered. Then he saw the man's eyes, glowing in the dark like twin moons. Saw the madness that dwelled within. He knew then that he was doomed. He struggled against his binds, scraping the chair that was his prison against the floor. 

""It's not your money I want, Mr. Hitler."" He raised a silver razor that glinted in the lamplight. 

""It's your facial hair.""

Adolf ceased his struggling, and stared at the man. ""...vat?""
 
The man stepped into the light, and regarded Adolf intensely. 

""Among the many atrocities you would soon commit, Mr. Hitler, you are about to forever ruin a fashion, a style, a simple pleasure of the masses. The toothbrush mustache.""

Adolf continued to stare incomprehensibly. 

""I...huh?""

The man leaned in, holding the razor before Adolf's eyes. 

""The Mustache will forever be associated with that toxic facade you call a face, and never again be acceptable in civilized society. For men like me who can grow absolutely nothing else-and believe me Mr. Hitler, I have tried-it is a tragedy of magnificent proportion. So, I have taken upon myself the burden of correcting this travesty of fate."" 

The man grabbed the the chair, and leaned it back against the wall. Adolf got a chill as he applied shaving cream to his face. The man's leering, jackal-esque face came into view again. 

""Let's clean your look up, shall we?""

****

It was the most terrifying twenty-three minutes of Adolf's life as the man delicately scraped the Mustache from his upper lip. When hed finished, he wiped the blade on the leather, cleansed his patients face with a warm towel, and then deftly cut the ties that bound him. Before Adolf could stand on his now tingling legs, the man put the razor to his throat. 

""I don't want to kill you, Mr. Hitler. But be sure that if you begin to contemplate fashioning your face to replicate it's former manner and taint once again that oldest and most elegant of Mustaches; be assured, I will."" 

Then as quickly and violently as he'd come, the man vanished into the darkness, leaving his stupefied victim agape in the glow of a dying lantern.

****

*Five years later*

Hitler had never felt prouder as he stood in Times Square, the Nazi Regimes' emblem displayed on the billboards surrounding it. At the end of his signature erratically inspiring speech, with hundreds of troops cheering their victory around him, he spotted a single face in the crowd. The face smiled at him from beneath the sanctuary of a toothbrush Mustache.",blakester731

[WP] A man goes back in time to 1940's Germany to save the Toothbrush mustache.,DoctorSoda,"This was it. Over a decade of the agent's life had been devoted to the cause, preparing for this exact moment.

His target, the one and only Adolf Hitler, stood behind a podium as he enraptured the German masses. The agent waited, hidden in the wings of the stage, his right hand buried in his jacket pocket. His fingers closed around the sacred weapon. Its weight soothed his nerves.

All he had to do was wait for the signal.

There. A flash of movement in the crowd, another agent of theirs. Hitler's security staff turned towards the decoy and fired. Yet another life, sacrificed for the cause.

The agent's thumb pressed against the on-switch and lunged, his hand whipping out from his jacket, his weapon bared and buzzing. Hitler turned towards the noise. The man's face was so close…

A bullet ripped through the agent's hand, knocking the weapon away. It clattered against the stage floor and spun out of reach. More bullets followed, tore through his chest. The agent hadn't been allowed to wear a protective vest; none of them were. It'd been against the rules, technology that was never to fall into the hands of the enemy.

The agent hit the floor as Hitler was quickly ushered away by his remaining staff, and below the Nazi's shocked eyes rested his toothbrush mustache, still proud and unshaven. Far across the stage lay the electric razor he'd brought back with him in time, still buzzing… would continue to buzz until it was taken apart by some mad scientist…

[WP] You have found that the place where your school once was is now barren of all life.,DoctorSoda,"""Hey, Tallahassee, pull over for a minute!""

Next to me, the big man behind the wheel grunted, not looking over at me.  ""What?"" he asked sourly, not taking his foot off of the accelerator.

""Seriously, come on.  See that building?""  I pointed out through the windshield, still grimy from an old splatter of blood that I hadn't managed to fully scrape off at our last gas station.  ""Head over to that.""

For a minute, I thought that Tallahassee wouldn't bother, that he'd just keep driving.  After all, we'd set our destination as Dayton (""That big race track has just GOTTA have Twinkies!"", he'd exclaimed), and we had a few more hours of driving to go.  The sun was already starting to sink towards the horizon.

*Rule #9: Avoid driving after dark.  Zombies don't look both ways.*

""Why?"" he asked at length, finally taking his eyes off of the road to look sidelong at me.

I sighed.  Might as well just go ahead and tell him the truth.  ""Because it's where I spent some of the worst years of my life.""

That raised his curiosity, at least.  ""What's that mean?""

""I mean, it's my high school.""

Of course that got a reaction.  Tallahassee hooted, and yanked the wheel off to the side.  The big Hummer veered off the road and across the grass, the suspension bouncing as the tires rolled over rocks and lumps of dirt.  ""Columbus's high school!"" he echoed.  ""Now, this I gotta see!""

We pulled into the parking lot, and I sat up a little in surprise as I recognized one of the few vehicles sitting on the mostly empty stretch of asphalt.  ""Hey, I know that car!"" I said.  ""That's Principal Thompson's car!""

""Oh, really?""  With a grin, Tallahassee steered the Hummer right into the side of the little green sedan, T-boning the other car with a crunch.  ""Well, there's your senior prank for you!""

I just shook my head, waiting for the car to come to a stop before opening the door (*Rule #32: Enjoy the little things.*).  I climbed out, taking a minute to stretch after the long car ride before reaching inside to grab my shotgun (*Rule #18: Limber up.*).

""So, we gonna find your name on anything in here?"" Tallahassee asked as I poked my way cautiously in through the broken glass on the school's front door.  ""You win trophies for anything?""

""I wasn't big into sports,"" I answered.  Now, looking back, I should have started running earlier, getting into cardio.  Would have come in handy.

He grunted.  ""I dunno, maybe they give awards for bein' a little bitch, these days.  They give them out for everything else.""

I ignored Tallahassee's continued chatter as we headed into the main lobby of the school.  Looking around, nostalgia washed over me, and I had to blink a few times to keep from tearing up. 

""It's weird, isn't it?"" I asked, shaking my head.  ""I mean, I hated all my time here.  I wanted to just get out, not have to deal with any of the idiots in my class any longer.  But now, I kind of miss the place.""

Next to me, Tallahassee shook his head.  ""Never went back to mine for any of the reunions,"" he said.  ""Once ran into the former prom king, though.""

""What did you do?"" I asked, curious in spite of myself.

He flashed white teeth at me.  ""Shot him in the face, of course.  Man, he was a fat one.  Really fell apart after high school, I guess.""

I should have guessed.  ""Here, let's go up and check out the second floor, really quick,"" I said, heading for the big main stairs.  

""Yeah?  What's up there?""  Tallahassee cocked his gun as he followed after me.  ""Lemme guess, the library?  You spent a lot of time hiding out up there?""

I didn't answer him.  We were heading for the classroom on the left side, one of the few places I liked to attend.  I pushed open the door and slowly entered, my gun sagging down from my fingers as I looked around.

""Mrs. Megan's class,"" I said, slowly running my eyes around the room, looking at the decaying pieces of papers stuck to the walls.  ""Art class.  She always told me that I could make something of myself.""

""Bet she wasn't thinking about zombie killer as a job,"" Tallahassee countered, but he stepped into the room after me, poking into some of the drawers. 

I ignored him.  I stepped over to the far side of the wall.  Would it still be here, after all this time?  

From behind me, I heard a hiss of canned air.  ""Hey, I found spray paint!""  Tallahassee sounded delighted.  The monkey had a new toy to distract himself with.

""I wonder what happened to her,"" I said softly, looking around the room once again.  The chairs and tables were overturned, some of them broken.  The carpet felt hard and dirty underfoot.  Already, the place was falling into disrepair.  No room for art school in Zombieland.  ""She was young.  She could have made it.""

I glanced over at Tallahassee, wondering if he'd reply.  He, however, was busy spray-painting the teacher's desk in shades of neon green and orange, cackling the whole time.  ""Check it out!  Best art piece of the year!""

""Of course,"" I said, giving up.  ""All right, we should get out of here.""

He nodded agreeably and tossed the spray paint cans aside.  Before following him to the door, however, I reached out to the wall.

It was still there.  I'd finally spotted it, partially covered by a couple of splattered paint canvases.  I pulled the little charcoal drawing off the wall, holding it in my hand and looking down at it for a minute before folding the paper in half.  My eyes had tears in the corners, and I sniffled and wiped them away before heading back out.

""Tallahassee?"" I called out, heading back for the lobby of the high school.  ""You poking around?  The cafeteria got rid of all the junk food before I left, so there won't be any-""

I heard a noise off to my left, near the cafeteria, and turned.  But instead of Tallahassee holding up still-wrapped candy bars in triumph, I saw a flash of yellow teeth, gray skin, hands reaching out for me...

""Aah!""  I staggered back, grabbing for my shotgun.  The zombie rushed forward, a decaying red-and-black tie still flapping from around his neck, his face terrifyingly familiar as he roared and grabbed at me.

I finally managed to get the shotgun up, but he was too close to aim.  I swung the barrel around, cracking him on the side of the head.  The zombie roared again, but he didn't back off.  He managed to catch my feet, and I tumbled down onto the ground, looking up at his big looming shape.

He looked down at me, a yellow light glinting in his eyes as he opened his mouth - and then his head exploded as thunder echoed around the room.

""Damn, one of them still hiding out in here!""  Tallahassee stepped up into my vision after a moment, shaking his head as he lowered the gun to put another shot through the fallen zombie's chest (*Rule #2: Double tap.*).  ""Wonder what he was doing here.""

""I thought he was about to give me detention,"" I said shakily as I accepted Tallahassee's hand to get back up.  

It took the other man a minute to catch on, but he hooted and slapped his knee.  ""No way!  That's the principal himself?""

I nodded, looking down at the man who had ruled my high school years with an iron fist.  ""Yeah.""

""Well, that seems like karma, I guess,"" he remarked as we headed out of the school and back to our car.

""Karma?  How?""

""I dunno, one of those things.  Irony?""

""I don't think so.""

We climbed into the Hummer, and Tallahassee headed back for the highway.  ""Deja vu?  Is that it?""

I didn't know what he was after, and debating anything literary with the man was an exercise in futility.  ""Sure,"" I gave in, sinking down in my seat.  I heard the slight crinkle of the drawing tucked into my pocket, and patted it gently.

We drove on, the sunset burning the sky above us.

It is a rather noises part of town. Many families have been there for generations and I have just moved to this part of town a couple months ago. 

I moved here after my partner and I broke up. Actually all the stuff was his and he allowed me to use it all, as he often reminded me towards the end of our relationship. We met 6 years ago and I moved in with him only after about 2 months of dating. His place was fully furnished and his stuff was much nicer than mine. So most of my stuff, besides some family pictures and nicknacks, was thrown away. 

Now 28 years old, I feel like I am starting all over again for the first time in my life. Moving in to his house right after college I never had to go thought the pangs of building yourself after graduation. Now at 28, I have to do what I should have done at 22. Sleep on a mattress on the floor in a sleeping bag, with one cup, one plate, a mug, a fork, and my clothes still in the bags I brought them in which now are being used as makeshift closets. 

Low confidence. I lower my head as I pass people on the street as if they can see that I have relied on someone my whole adult life and made nothing of myself. I can barley bring myself to talk to other people. Every once and a while someone does talk to me and I get very anxious. I feel as if I just want to leave and walk straight out of the conversation mid sentence. I just don't know what to do.

""And on some of those rocks life emerges.""

""It's life. Plants, animals, people, places, things. That sort of thing""

""So there's life and there's nouns. Then life begins to question things. It asks, 'why am I here?' And, 'what is my purpose?'""

""So they won't know why you made everything?""

""Not at all.""

""Okay, continue.""

""What can I help you with today?"" she asked rather joyfully, considering that this was City Hall.

""So, yeah,"" I began hesitantly, ""This is going to sound ridiculously stupid. Apparently the DMV thinks...""

She raised a hand to interrupt. ""My condolences. This isn't the first time we've had to ""raise the dead"" so to speak, but no worries, I'll just get the paperwork and we'll...""

""No no,"" I cut her off before she could finish, ""they don't think I'm DEAD, they think I'm 130 years old!"" 

""Oooh!"" she practically lit up with poorly contained excitement, ""Now THAT is something new! I am SOOO winning City Hall Bingo this week!"" She paused to take a measured breath then continued in a more restrained manner, ""Ok sir, tell me what's going on and I will see what I can do to help.""

""Well, it started when I went to apply for a passport, apparently when they checked my license number the DMV came back with my age as 130. It's obviously some sort of typo."" I handed her my license and pointed out the birthdate, ""I can only guess it's because my birthday is January 8th 1986 that the abbreviation 1/8/86 somehow got in place of the year. I honestly never noticed it on my license before. So now they want me to ""prove"" it, and one of the things they need is a birth certificate, but mine is still out with my passport application."" 

She squinted at the license through glasses that rested on the tip of her nose, perilously close to dropping onto her lap with even the smallest movement, ""Ah yes, I see. Well this seems pretty simple."" She reached for a small form from a stack readily at hand. ""Fill out the request form here while I go fetch this from the vault.""

She popped out of her chair and headed to the rear of the office where a large vault door stood open, I could see the spacious area beyond lined with shelves from floor to ceiling filled with large books, then she disappeared around a corner. 

I turned my attention to the form in front of me. Standard stuff. Name, birth date, parents names. By the time I finished signing the request the woman had returned with a large book that she dropped onto the desk with a heavy thud. She grabbed my completed form and compared it to the page in the book, ""Good good. Everything matches. You passed! I just have to ask you a few more questions, then you'll be on your way, hold on a second while I find that form.""

She scurried off again then returned a moment later securing some papers to a clipboard. Sitting at the desk, she leaned back in the chair, ""Ok, let's see,"" she scanned the form, ""Ah! Here's the part for you. Ok first question, Have you ever been cryogenically frozen?""

""Um...no.""

She clicked her pen to life as she marked the appropriate box. ""Good. Have you ever traveled backward or forward in time? If so, how far and in which direction/s?""

""Er...No I haven't.... is this some sort of joke?""

She frowned at me as she looked up from her clipboard, annoyed she replied, ""Not at all.""

""When did you discover you were immortal?"" She continued reading, more sternly it seemed.

""I...I...I'm not immortal. What the hell kind of question is that!?"" 

""Mr. Thompson, there is no need to get angry with me. I'm just doing my job. I don't write this stuff, I just ask the questions and send it to the capitol. Be thankful that the DMV didn't declare you dead instead of merely ""extra elderly"". Now, let's get this done, I have more people waiting.""

""Ok. I get it. Red tape I guess. Please, go on."" I rallied my patience. 

With that she rattled off question after question. Had I ever been exposed to radiation? Were my parents vampires and/or werewolves? Had I ever visited the south pole? Did I routinely eat honey bees? And so it went until finally she put the clipboard down in front of me and handing me her pen, she pointed to a space at the bottom, ""By signing here you are swearing that all of the above information is true.""

I took her pen and signed the bottom of the page.

""Very good!"" she scooped up the form and hastily tucked it away into a drawer. Then she made a photocopy from the book which held my birth certificate. She signed the copy then placed it in an old cast iron seal maker, pressing down firmly, creating the raised impression on the paper which gave the document authenticity. 

Finally. I could get out of h....

She paused just as she was about to hand it to me, a slow bemused smile creeped across her lips as she scrutinized the document, ""Oh Dear."" she said in a tone that belied her obvious joy, ""it seems there is an error on your birth certificate.""
She laid the paper on the desk and pointed out a box on the form.

""Seems the hospital marked your gender as Female.""

""You have got to be kidding me!"" I stared at the small typed ""F"" in the corner box reserved for gender. ""I'm clearly not a woman!"" My patience with bureaucratic bullshit was at an end but before I could set loose a stream of obscenity, that would surely see me thrown out of the building, the woman held up an authoritative hand, cutting off my futile complaints.

""Now don't you worry. I'll get the appropriate forms. We'll get you all fixed up in no time."" 

She bounded out of sight once again, and from somewhere in the back of the office I could distinctly make out her voice excitedly shouting, ""BINGO!""

[WP] You have just noticed that your driver's license lists your birthday as being a hundred years ago.,DoctorSoda,"""Oh for fuck's sake... LISA! LISAAAA!""

I yell to the next room where my wife is typing away at the computer keyboard, working on her next great novel as she had been for the past year.

""WHAT Theo?!""

She replied with that familiar annoyed tone she always had when I interrupted her work, and I could hear the chair wheels roll across the hardwood as she got up and crossed to the bedroom to find out what had me yelling.

""Lisa, you did it AGAIN.""

My wife, effervescent as always in her comfy but attractive sweater dresses and with that absolute WATERFALL of golden blonde hair, furrowed her brow in anger at me and crossed her arms over her chest.

""What are you talking about, Theo?""

""My driver's license! It says I was born in 1885 instead of 1985! This is the third time I've had to have you remake this one, what if I'd been pulled over for a check or something? The police ALWAYS run a license when there's errors!""

""Well if SOMEONE would just man up and learn how to forge his OWN documents then I wouldn't be accidentally fucking up all of his, would I?!"" She threw her hands in the air as she barked this at me, and I could feel my blood pressure rise in the usual and familiar way.

""Come ON Lisa, you know I have better things to do! Would you like to go run all the pick-ups, or manage all our money? You know we both have our talents, and it's worked all this time!""

Her brow softened slightly, a sign she was conceding to my point and I softened my tone to one of endearment.

""Baby, you know I appreciate you but we also have to be careful. You know what would happen to us if we were caught.""

""Yeah yeah, I know. Look, I'm sorry, I'll get you a new one by tonight."" She relaxed in the doorway, slouching against the frame with body language that told me the short spat was already forgotten; it was easy to forget things when you were like us, after all. ""Speaking of which, did you ever get back to the Hendersons about that dinner invite? I know they wanted us there for four o'clock, but...""

I sighed my own annoyance this time, rolling my eyes at the thought of the overly-friendly next door neighbours.

""I called Ted and told him we wouldn't be able to make it out before seven, and they said that was fine, so we're all set for wednesday.""

""Oh, good then!"" This cheered Lisa right up, even though I hated the perky idiots who were only interested in us because of her writing career. Every time we trudged across our property line to play nice with them I spent the entire time thinking about ripping their throats out all over that tacky white leather sofa. ""That'll be well after sunset, perfect! Thanks babe.""

""Yeah, no problem. Look, I'm going on a blood run around eight tonight: St. Margaret's is receiving a huge load of type-O and I wanna see what I can get before it gets to inventory. Want anything while I'm out?""

""Nah, that's fine babe. Thanks for asking though. I gotta get back to work.""

With that final comment she flashed me that timeless, predatory little fanged grin of hers before disappearing back to her office to finish fleshing out whatever chapter she'd been working on before.

Gav searched Joe with her eyes. He was telling the truth, about at least the last part...

Several hours later as the night started to set the pair realised that once again the horizon stayed the same. It was always the same. They had about 3 days of fresh water left and not including Gavs chocolate bar, the pair had half a pound of salt pork, and a dozen twinkies. Gavs eyes drooped while staying at the setting sun. ""Ten days huh?"" And she closed them.

Water made it way into the boat in waves, the first smacking Gav awake right in the face. The sides of the boat were level with the ocean and the boat was filled with clams, glass bottles, flapping fish and all sorts of aquatics treasures riffled with green and brown algae.

The two survivors were soon swimming together with scattered bottles and other floatables.

Johnson walked into his cabin room. ""Not again!"" He exclaimed. Resting on his pillow was a tooth made from pure gold. It was the tenth item he had been gifted this week. And would surely join the ranks of the missing items list plastered amongst the ships hallways. He couldn't hand them back, of course, lest he proclaim himself an honest thief. Instead, Johnson skulled back from a half bottle of rum and tried to get some shut eye.

The man on the other side of the wall chuckled.  ""That's what you get for pushing me out of that tree.""

""Will you let that go?""  Allen had never forgiven me for that tree prank.  Every bad thing that happened to me was, in his eyes, some kind of karmic retribution for the time I'd pushed him out of a tree when I was five.

Allen didn't say anything.

""Come on,"" I finally spoke up.  ""Just talk to them, okay?""

""What do want to talk about?"" Allen asked.

I rolled my eyes.  ""Oh, I don't know, how about the fact that the robots locked me in this room?""

""What's wrong with talking about you?"" he replied.

""Now,"" I growled, ""is not the time for you to get all amateur-psychologist on me!  Talk me out of here!""

I could swear I heard him laughing again.  ""You aren't over seven feet tall?"" he asked.

If I were that tall, I could climb up to the vent I was talking at and shimmy through to Allen's side.  ""You know I'm not, otherwise we'd be having this conversation in person.""

""How many other people are you talking to right now?""

He had a point, it wasn't like I had much choice.  The robots weren't good conversationalists.  ""Just you, buddy.  Now, are you going to talk the bots out of this or what?""

""No,"" he replied, ""but that is a pretty funny assumption.  My mission is to see how long the world can stay sane.""

""And by 'the world', you mean me.""

I could practically hear his nonchalant shrug.  ""I have many other things to say, but I can't translate them well enough to express what I really mean.""

Ugh, this again.  ""You are not French.""  I said.  The only thing to do with this particular fantasy was nip it in the bud as soon as possible.  ""And even if you were, it translates into English pretty okay.""

""I AM a person, actually,"" he corrected me, as though I'd even suggested that he wasn't.  ""It's YOU who isn't a person.""

""Just because they're robots doesn't mean I am.""  I insisted.

""Just because I'm a computer program doesn't mean I don't have feelings."" he replied.

That was it, that was the last straw.  Bad enough that my parents were robots, but I simply wouldn't stand Allen pretending he was one of them too.  ""You know what?  Fine.  Fine!  They must have known trying to talk to you would be worse than being sent to my room.""

I stalked to the door and shouted at it, where they were sure to hear:

""FINE!""  I said.  ""I'll eat my brussel sprouts!""

This should not be happening. No, this is all wrong. Maybe it's some sort of infection? You think you should go to the doctor immediately to get some answers- but you still have so much work to do. The kitchen is full of the earthy aromas of authentic Indian cuisine, bubbling happily on the stove. The timer ticks down the minutes until the bread is finished in the oven. The un-chopped vegetables beckon you to finish your task, lest the curry cook without them. Taking a deep breath, you decide to finish cooking first. Surely it was in your imagination, right? The steam could have come from the pots behind you, or it was a trick of the light. Besides, you didn't even feel the nick. Yes, it must have been your imagination. Your thoughts then begin to redirect themselves back into the task at hand as you methodically attack the hundreds of little tasks necessary before the four course dinner could be complete.

Curry was always his favorite dish, and you made a point to remember this.

He comes to the table and sits down. He asks you how your day was? Fine, you say. Small talk between two individuals with an intimate connection.

""Well, I'm probably just being silly, but when I was chopping the onion earlier I nicked my finger. No blood came out, and I'm not hurt or anything, but I could swear I saw some steam come out!"" You manage a couple light-hearted laughs. Your husband puts down his fork and looks at you intently. The way his eyes bore into your soul sends shivers down your spine, and you know you could never lie to this man.

""Dear, forget that happened. Forget that happened immediately,"" he growls. His eyebrows were knitted together in a grimace. The gruffness of his voice scared you, but the command brought up something within you. Some sort of deep, innate connection with this man that you do not understand.

[WP] The stuff you drew as a child has been brought to life and is now at your door.,DoctorSoda,"When I was a kid, I could never draw. All I could ever draw was weapons. Fruits. Anything that wasn't human.

Art class never changed anything, it just meant I could draw buildings better. Tech design was mostly making and creating, not planning. 

There was one time, back when I was depressed. One time I drew a person that didn't look weird enough to be erased.

Back then, I wanted a knight in shining armor to save me. I wanted him to be big, tall, beefed up to the point where he needed custom armor.

I continued drawing weapons. I'd design weapons for some weird game- coincidentally, like my predicament, it was about a knight who found himself in modern times. These weapons were improvised, things that you could make from scratch. Baseball bats with nails in them, lamp flails, curtain rods with the glass ends shattered. Or were they crystal? 

Eventually, I started therapy. My high school friends would graduate from university, or marry, or become famous. 

I heard one of them hit it off with one of the beefcake teachers from our old school. Lucky them.

Studying in university is hard, and eventually I would relapse back into depression. My roommates knew, and tried to help.

Something inside me was stirring. Something inside me was struggling, trying to break free. I didn't know what it was. All I could feel was apathy. My grades dropped. I was done. 

Sometimes, I wondered if anyone cared.

Then, there was a knock at the door.

When I opened it, there he was. The knight in shining armor that I worked hard on. 3 months of work and it had led to this.

I had skipped the face, so where his face would be was a black shadow, his eyes blue orbs.

With him was plenty of weapons, everything I designed.

The knight grunted, a deep grunt. I had designed him to be as terrifying as possible, and no doubt that he would send chills down my back with every word.

""It's time."" He said, metaphorical ice dripping from his throat. A wooden stick was tossed into my hands.

At the very moment, everything erupted into chaos.

"[WP] Anyone who enters your apartment door, no matter when they entered it, steps into the same point in time.",DoctorSoda,"Apartment 531 is a very strange place if you ask me. That black metal unassuming door taught me a lot about the things I never wanted to think about. It taught me a lot about destiny and inevitability. You see when you step into that apartment you don't just travel in space, but you travel in time as well. A very specific point in time.

Everyone who goes through that door ends up in that room in the exact same moment in time. Which means everyone who ever has, or will, walk through that door is there.

Fourteen of us entered that room at some point in time. Only fourteen will ever enter that room. neither chance, fate, nor happenstance have any say in that number. Fourteen is fourteen. 

The fourteen of us talked and shared our experiences, but I couldn't pay attention to that. I had bigger question in my head that none of them could answer. 

Our numbers never changed. Did that mean that only fourteen would ever enter? Was our fate already predetermined to enter that room? Did we truly have a say in how our lives would turn out, or were we puppets in the play? 

If fate dictated where we would go, did our decisions matter?

"[WP] Anyone who enters your apartment door, no matter when they entered it, steps into the same point in time.",DoctorSoda,"When I saw the ad for it, I thought it was too good to be true.  It was.  $500/month for a brand new two bedroom apartment?  The building was only finished two months prior and had all the modern amenities.  It wasn't until the third day after moving in I realized that it also came with a curse.

I brought my brother over to check it out and when he crossed the threshold he vanished.  The cops thought I was crazy.  No one would believe me.  His wife never treated me the same again.  I think she thought I did something to him.

I had a sneaky suspicion the lady in the leasing office knew what was going on but wouldn't say anything to the police.  Why else did they list that apartment so low?  Every other apartment in the building was at least 4X the price.  They had to know.

I was devastated for months.  My brother was my best friend.  We could talk about anything.  Despite the incident, I decided to stay there.  You couldn't beat that rent anywhere in the state.

I wouldn't let anyone visit, obviously.  I wasn't going to risk losing anyone else to...whatever this was.

About two years after living there I met a girl in the bar down the street.  I was wasted and not thinking with my head, at least not the one on my shoulders.  We went back to my place and I discovered the most bizarre way in the world to cockblock yourself.

A few months after that my stove broke.  I called in to get maintenance to come fix it.  They refused.  I went to the office and demanded some answers.  They knew what was going on, they just weren't willing to admit anything.

I must have argued with the Property Manager for two hours.  He wouldn't cave.  He finally compromised and said he would send a repairman from the fire escape.  I agreed, at least I could get my stove fixed.  Guess the window works the same as the door.  Had to fix the damn thing myself.  It still makes a weird noise whenever I turn it to high heat.

A year passed after that.  One night I woke up at 2 AM to a banging at my door.  My brother's wife screamed at me through the door.  I opened it to step out and talk to her.  She was obviously drunk and still accusing me of killing my brother.  Before I could stop her she pushed me aside and vanished.

Police showed up at my door two days later, asking about her.  I guess she had filed a report back when my brother disappeared stating I was responsible.  But the cops had no evidence and didn't act on it, until now.  They must have thought I had something to do with her missing.

They must have thought I was hiding something when I told them I wouldn't let them enter.  They got a warrant and then there were two cops missing.  As you can imagine this did not go well for me.  More cops tried to come arrest me only to succumb to the same fate.  I was quickly becoming public enemy number one.  And even though I felt terrible, I couldn't leave my apartment.  The curse was also my protector.  

Eventually the cops figured out what was happening, even if they didn't understand it.  They had 24 hour guards stationed outside my door and window.

I had maybe a week's worth of food.  This wouldn't last forever.  After 3 days of being under ""house arrest"" I was debating giving myself up.  None of it was my fault, but I would be blamed for everything.  I sat in my chair staring at the door.  It was time.  Time to end this.

I stood walking over to it.  I turned the handle and was startled by a sudden eruption of shouts behind me.  I heard an especially loud ""-uck!"".  I turned to see around twenty people in my living room.  My brother stood three feet away from me.  I began crying as I embraced him.  His wife ran from the kitchen to join us.  I looked around at the rest of my sudden guests.  A few construction workers seemed the most disoriented.  They must have been the first victims.  I saw the drunk girl, all the cops that tried to get in, one of which I didn't recognize.  A few other random people I didn't recognize, and what looked like an older me.

The older me looked at me, gave me a wink and stepped over to the door.  He opened it and walked out only to be immediately tackled by the police outside.  One of the cops looked through the open door.  It was the cop I didn't recognize.  He saw himself.  He walked forward and vanished with a ""what the f-"".

An old man walked over to me.  After a moment I realized it was another older copy of myself.

""Hehe oh this place.  Weird huh?""

""What the hell is going on?  Are you me?""

""Yup.  You see in about 12 years, someone's going to launch a nuke.  I never found out who fired first.  But we had mere hours before they struck.  I had a wonderful idea.  I came back here, twas long after I moved.  Safer than a bunker right?""

""I guess.""

""Yeah then I had the bright idea to run out the front door.  Forgot about the cops haha.  Man he's gonna have a rough couple months, not as bad as you though,"" he said with a wink.

""So then who are you?""

""Well surprise surprise I actually lived through another 12 years.  So I came back again.  But seeing as how I'm the oldest us that's here, guess that I don't make it around for another pass.  I'm ok with that.  I've had enough craziness in my life.""

I stood there dumbfounded.  After a long long time in legal battles over the incident, I moved.  I couldn't take that place anymore.  Someone else seemed to want it though.  Actually it became pretty popular after the news coverage.  Became the most expensive apartment in the city.

Who wouldn't want to live in the Time-Traveling Apartment?

Brock put a hand on Jims arm and gave him the usual ""stay here and wait for my call"" look and went out to intercept the spy.

Hours went by, and Jim was getting impatient and bored.  He decided that it had been too quiet and went out searching.  As he entered the mess hall, what he found nearly made him vomit.  Brock and two other guards were sharing family photos with the very confused looking spy.   They were trading fishing spots, tricks, and even talking about the pros and cons of their weapons.  Jim burst through the door weapon up and shouted ""on your knees spy,  we've got a real nice room for you!"" Brock stood up and instructed jim to drop the gun.  ""Jim, have you not been paying attention to any of the seminars? Kill him with kindness jim.""   Jim stormed out and headed back to his bed, he was flabbergasted.

The next morning he woke up and checked on his partner.  He found him leaving the administration wing with a shiny new promotion.  Dumbfounded he demanded what happened from Brock.  Brock looked at him, shook is head and said ""killed him with kindness, shortly after you left, he just keeled over foaming at the mouth.""",Taintius_thundercock
"[WP] The spy infiltrating the enemy base is surprised to find that the guards are not trying to kill him; on the contrary, they seem way too friendly.",DoctorSoda,"I stand behind the front desk, watching the monitors. Most days it's perfunctory. Today we are expecting an infiltration. Jimmy down in central access reported being seduced by a super spy. Jimmy gets a lot of action that way. He knows how to dress-down nerd style and he's one of the few gay guys who works in access so he's a super obvious target.

Jimmy goes to sick call a lot for the clap, but he's totally overpaid for that.

So anyway, as soon as the come-on started up he called in a ""long night"" and flagged his own access. That's a full week of extra vacation time right there.

So the super spy shows up. Good looking kid, of course. Almost worth a go myself, but I'm getting a little old for all that and I've moved up to direct henchman, so I've got access to the pleasure halls anyway. I mean it's not _quite_ the same as landing a free-range spy, but what is?

I approach the security gate and wait for ""Jimmy"" to finish clearance.

""Hello Mr. West, Jimmy said you'd be stopping by.""

""But I left him unconscious in his room.""

""Lucky Dog, that means he wins this month's bonus pool. So I figured we'd head over to interrogation and get all your questions answered.""

""Wait... all _my_ questions answered?""

""Yes sir, here's your briefing package.""

I walk Mr. West to a well appointed conference room with a door labeled ""interrogation"".

""First, Mr. West, may I call you James? Yes? Okay James. I need to ask you a few questions. Just as a baseline. Are you satisfied with your current employment? If not we might be able to save some time by shunting you straight into 'Bribery' or even 'Intake'. We've got most of your dossier on order but the initial checks show you could come in at gold level at least.""

""You can't bribe me. You can't turn me. Mister...""

""Gordon. Artemus Gordon. You can call me Arty if you like."" We are supposed to use aliases and I thought that one would be amusing, all things considered. ""So if we are going to skip all the recruiting, is there anyone you'd particularly like to have threatened or menaced going forward? I don't see any standouts in the cheat-sheet.""

""What exactly is going on Arty? What's your game?""

""Oh, we here at the Parasol Group have realized that we lose far to much time and important manpower to these various raids and incursions. Things get blown up and people get shot. It was killing our health insurance premiums and our ranking on the employment boards were dropping. So we've taken action.""

""So this is a trap?"" He fidgeted for one of his gadgets.

""Yes and No. You are in no danger at all as long as you carry yourself with deportment while on the premises. You are free to go at any time. If you'd like to go and return I can get you your own badge, or you can continue to use the one you've gotten. It's been retasked to you. And absolutely everyone will honestly answer any question you pose or assist you in any way you wish. After all, 'There are no locked doors at the Parasol Group.'"" I point to the sign that says exactly that.

""Then tell me about the Diamonds and why they've been rerouted?""

I bring up the presentation system. ""Let's see I show twenty two operations involving diamonds. Can you be more specific?""

""The diamonds that were smuggled out of Ba Ling on the hovercraft ferry.""

""Ah, I have a listing here. I'm afraid I don't have access to shipment records. Someone in transportation will have to help you. I can call them, or I'll print you up a records request and you can go over there directly. It's marked out on the facilities map in your packet.""

""You expect me to fall for this?""

""Fall for what? Oh. You believe I'm running some sort of scam. I assure you this is all on the up-and-up. We here at Parasol engage in extreme compartmentalization and telepresence engineering."" I key up one of our better slideshows. ""With our virtual engineering and control infrastructure there's no need for secret bases. Most of our command and control functions are decentralized, with 'deskmates' in dozens of facilities being assembled into the working staff of any given project more-or-less on demand. Each of us has from one to about seventeen extreme specializations.""

""So...""

""So while any one of us will seek to help you to the fullest extent of our personal knowledge and access, each employee and terminal has a limited view of what's going on. Since each project has it's own informal operational norms, if you really want to get anywhere you need to find someone working on the project you are specifically interested in and get them to assist you as best they can.

""It's a service they've been instructed to offer. That way there are no messy torture or personal loss scenarios to deal with.

""By my understanding the bureaucracy does the rest of the heavy lifting.

""I believe you've seen our motivational signs? 'Ten and Done'? It's not just a slogan. Every critical operation has a maximum allowed operational window of ten working days. Our efficiency studies show it takes about fourteen working days to to fully brief a newcomer to enough of a project that they can become a nuisance. So we have a ninety four percent success rate in all commissions and micro-tasks. as they are complete before any interference is statistically possible.""

""Mister West? You look positively flushed. Is there anything I can get for you? Maybe you'd like an hour down in Pleasure Services to relax and get your bearings. We can even send a car around for Jimmy if he was particularly interesting to you. As someone used to navigating Access he might even be able to cut a day or so off of your investigation.""

West's face is bright red with repressed outrage. ""That's impossible. How can you get _anything_ done?""

""That's not my area. Perhaps I can set up a meeting with someone from Planning and Logistics, they've got this great new software system..."" I start to key up another of our excellent presentations but I seem to lose Mr. West's attention. ""I'll give you a moment to collect yourself before we continue. Coffee?""",BitOBear
"[WP] The spy infiltrating the enemy base is surprised to find that the guards are not trying to kill him; on the contrary, they seem way too friendly.",DoctorSoda,"Lukas did his best to hide his anxiety, pretending to bob his head along to music from his earbuds. He knew he had the best secret spy equipment the Mercenary Surveillance Agency could provide, but it was still his first operation outside his home country. As he shuffled down the line toward the small security center at the building’s entrance, he ran through his equipment in an effort to keep calm: the red ballpoint pen with ‘ink’ made of synthetic cobra venom; the blue pen that delivered a powerful sedative; the small notebook, made of paper laced with explosive thermite; the tissue packet, coated with a chemical to create billowing clouds of black smoke when burned; and the anime character keychain that became a tiny blowtorch when the head was popped off. Even the music player he was listening to had a second function – the file that appeared to be “Turn It On Again” by Genesis actually activated a miniature electromagnetic pulse bomb. Without a high-tech examination, though, none of the items broke Lukas’ cover as a tourist.

The security guard gave him a grin as he put his bag on the belt for the x-ray machine. Had someone in the Agency double-crossed him? Were the police- or worse- already waiting to arrest him on the other side?

“How are you today?” the security guard asked.

“Oh, er-” Lukas cursed himself as he fumbled for a good answer. “Fine, thank you.”

“Lithuania, eh?” So he had been betrayed! Lukas flinched back as the security guard raised a hand- and pointed to his baseball hat. “My wife’s family came from there, long time ago. Nice place?”

“Oh!” Damn it, he should have known picking that hat up from duty-free was a bad idea. “Yes. Very- I believe you would say- scenic?”

The security guard nods cheerfully. “Maybe I’ll have to start listening when she talks about visiting the old country.” He chuckles to himself, handing Lukas his bag. “You have a nice time today. Don’t get separated from your tour group!”

Was that a threat? Lukas felt the hair on the back of his neck prickle as he turned away. Crossing the atrium, he walked across the seal inlaid on the marble floor. Encircling the crown and maple leaf symbols, the legend on the seal read “Canadian Security Intelligence Service.”",baar-ur
"[WP] The spy infiltrating the enemy base is surprised to find that the guards are not trying to kill him; on the contrary, they seem way too friendly.",DoctorSoda,"""Another day, another target.""

Well that's what I thought anyway, but it was a different day. Instead of having to pick them off one by one, I had to make sure not too die of embarassment. Why you ask? 

They were so many of my relatives. Everyone, ranging from children running round the place to my grandparents who wouldn't dare move a muscle, which is partly them being lazy, but also their crippling arthritis. I didn't want to ignore them, but I wanted to kill my target, and then get the fuck out of there, so what did I do, I gave my mum a quick call.

""Err hi mum, can I...""

Before I could edge a word in, she gasped and then rapidly listed all of conservation topics we could of missed ""Oh my god! How is my little man doing? How's the new job? What have you been up to? Did you get yourself the Asian girlfirend you've always dreamed about? Will...""

I managed to stop her before the hundreds of other questions she had, I got straight to the point ""Look I don't have much time, can you find your boss? I really need to speak to her?""

""Of course!"" She exclaimed. ""Anything for you. Is there anywhere you'd like to meet, or will her office will do?""

""Office will be fine. Thank you."" I responded

Knowing that I was in a rush, she concluded ""Well you better get going, but it was lovely to speak to you. Bye!"" 

After the call, I started to speedwalk to the ominous tower, where I knew I had to go. Before that though, I had to open hundreds of missed birthday, christmas and get well soon cards that I never had time for. If this sounds weird, just know that my grandma is persistent to tell me how much I mean to everyone. It honestly makes me sad, due to the new job that I picked because of the paycheck.

But all I had to do now was to walk up the stairs and put a bullet in his head, but I just couldn't do it. I couldn't bring myself to do it.

"[WP] The spy infiltrating the enemy base is surprised to find that the guards are not trying to kill him; on the contrary, they seem way too friendly.",DoctorSoda,"This mission is essential to the safety of my nation. 

I must complete it. 

The layout of the room ahead of me is so cunningly simple it would almost be impossible to bypass. For anyone but me. Sneaking sneakily i make sure the guards on the other side of the large plain white room that are watching for any movement cannot see me approach by using my secret technique. Waving my hands before my face. The guaranteed technique my father passed down to me and his father to him.

""Do you hear anything, Guard number 2?"" ""Why, no, no i do not guard number 1. I most certainly do not see the gl-.. sorry. I mean. I do not see any spy whatsoever crossing in front of us."" The hand wave technique has one major flaw i whisper aloud, just enough for the guards to hear. It cannot mask sound. ""Oh! Wait!"" shouted guard number 1. I CAN hear.. something.. but what? I see nothing?!""

Whispering again, I let the guards know they must start scouting the room, or else i can't continue my critical mission of bypassing the guards to save the nation. ""Of.. of course gl.. umm.. Yes. Guard 1. We should scout for the enemy that is surely not in front of us and is secreted somewhere. Surely. For i can hear whispers on the wind yet see nothing."" The guards move in a well orchestrated maneuver, circling around me, still unable to see yet easily influenced by the 2nd technique passed down to me by my honorable father. The 'whisper your intentions while invisible technique.'

Now the door stands before me. Blocking me from my glorious mission. To the left was a large button with a circular mark and to the right was another large button marked with an x. My mission hinged on this one decision. I had to be fast while the guards patrolled. Because while invisible I could not affect the corporeal world. That would simply be unfair. Life, if anything, is incredibly fair.

Smiling, I slick my long flowing mane of hair back and release the technique, immediately becoming visible. Alarms sound, turning the white room red. The blare is nearly unbearable. Unleashing the third technique, I raise my left hand straight in the air and twirl it a bit. The universal signal to the world at large that the volume must be reduced just a tad. Sure enough, life listens and the alarms go down a tad. Much better.

Now for the grand decision. I only have 2 hours until the patrol finally turns back to this location. Sweat beads on my brow as I focus. Time slowing to a standstill. The hands on the clock above the door stopping as I squint my eyes and hum. Hmmmmmm. Hmmmmmm.


Hmmmm.

Aha!

My hand slowly moves towards the cross mark as my triumphant smile lights up the room. Slowly, slowly, my hand extends and opens, ready to embrace the countries salvation.

""Stop!""

""Stop stop stop stop stop!""

The red lights switch off leaving the room backlit in white. Facing me as I turn is Guard number 1.

""This is abso-fucking-lutely insane! Why are we letting this happen?! I'm fucking done! I AM DONE!.""

""First we have to wear these stupid pink uniforms. Not a huge problem, I don't mind pink but the polka dots?! Really?! Then there's the waving your hand thing. It DOESN'T make you invisible you fat fuck! Neither does waving your hand reduce the volume. The fuckers  in that window over there see what you're doing and go along with it. ALL of us go along with it. I refuse to any more.""

Guard 1 must have gone insane, I think. A new and exciting challenge for sure. The universe sure does like to throw a spanner in the works. Time to unleash my final and most powerful technique. Father always said to only use this sparingly. 

My hand raises, almost on it's own. This is bad. I must make sure to aim true or else untold damage could happen to the world at large. My pointing finger emerges, almost whipping outwards, damning Guard 1. As his face pales and his mouth trembles, I can see the defiance drain out of him like so many others.

""You surprise me with your attitude, Guard 1. Any last words before I press my thumb down?""

Guard 1 is shivering now, gripping the rubber gun in his hands so tight the white of his knuckles show plain as the walls of this room.

""Please.. glo-.. I mean.. master spy, sir. Please don't hurt my family for my.. outburst.""

Feeling magnanimous I show the guard my other hand, clad in rings. 

""Kiss, and I will only hang your family, instead of granting them untold torture for your insolence.""

""Thank you, oh thank you, Master spy. Please, thank you.""

His groveling displeases me but I allow him to plant his lips on my insignia rings, passed down for generations.

""Step back, your punishment awaits.""

""Yes, sir"" saluting, Guard 1 sheds tears as he stares behind me.

My thumb falls, smashing against the side of my hand as the walls around me open up and gunfire smashes into guard 1, obliterating him.

All that's left is a steaming pile of mush.

""Someone clean this mess up. I am going to continue my mission to save you all. Unless there are anymore... objections?"" 

An uproarious applause fills the room. Men dressed in green, almost weighed down by their medals are clapping like their lives depend on it as they step out from the shadows.

I walk up to the door that bars the way between me and victory and press the X button.

A large negative buzzing fills the room as the blood drains from the faces of everyone present .The door remains closed.

""General Soon. Who is responsible for this travesty? You do know that this nation cannot be saved if this door does not open?""

A small balding man stepped forward from the crowd of overly uniformed men.

""Glorious leader, I -""

My hand shoots up almost unwanted and I perform the deadly technique. Immediately bullets explode out of General soons chest, leaving him to slump to the floor in a bloody mess. A spatter landed on me, just next to my lips.

I lap it in. Delicious.

""Well then, Gentlemen. Let's reset and try again. Go and fetch a new guard. This time i will save this country. Or you will all die trying.""

I smile as those assembled scramble to accommodate me. My spy days are only beginning but I think, with practice, I will be able to steal those nuclear codes from America with ease thus saving the world and gracing it with my presence.

"[WP] The spy infiltrating the enemy base is surprised to find that the guards are not trying to kill him; on the contrary, they seem way too friendly.",DoctorSoda,"Clad in her own personal brand of armor, the skilled spy slinked around a corner as she eyed the boot emerging from a door in the hallway behind her. She felt smug satisfaction in the knowledge that she had eluded the burly guard captain in her quest to get the plans of the facility. Now she knew exactly where she needed to be; the main hall, just a few twists and turns through the maze-like structure and she would--

""Oomph!""

She let out a whoosh of air as she smacked bodily into the bulk and warmth of another person, going down in a tumble of large and small limbs, both of them frantically trying to disengage.

When the pair finally managed to untangle themselves and stand up the spy immediately tensed and rested her hands on her weapons. Of COURSE she would run smack dab into a guard at this stage of the mission! And he was a BIG one too; easily 6'5"" and god only knows how many pounds of muscle. She was going to have to hit him pretty hard to knock this one out. Great, this was fantastic.

""I'm sorry, Miss!""

The guard's hurried and frantic apology caught the spy completely off guard (haha, pun), and her gaze flashed to his face so she could gape dumbfounded at the chastised expression there.

""I didn't mean to bump into you! Please don't tell the boss, okay?""

And with that he was gone, dashing past her and around the corner she'd just turned a moment before, seemingly determined to put as much distance between them as possible.

""..... oooooookay.""

She muttered this to herself as she hurried down her now memorized path, taking the next two lefts, then a right, then a left... all the while trying to puzzle out the encounter she had just had. What had been up with that guy?

When she reached the meeting hall she found two more guardsmen stationed outside the large double doors, the only way in or out. She silently cursed from where she crouched behind a column, surveying the situation as she worked out her next move. If she could get close enough she could use a stun-whistler... yeah, put them out then drag them inside with her; this could work.

Standing up, she sauntered out from her hiding place with a purposeful sway to her leather-clad hips, her lips parted slightly for the strongest effect.

""Hey boys, I don't suppose I could just get into--""

""OH! Oh Miss, it's you! Right away Miss, here!""

The spy gaped as the two men jumped to attention, both grabbing a heavy door handle and hauling open the double doors to give her free passage.

*Okay, what the HELL WAS HAPPENING, THIS IS--*

*Oh. Ooooooh. What?!*

Visible through the now open doors was the back wall of the long, luxurious main hall. Giant and imposing hung a painting of her mark; a millionaire with a penchant for crime, he stood threatening and dark on a background of city scape, posed on an expensive looking balcony. It was the young woman sitting in a chair in front of him that caught her attention though.

His hand was on her shoulder in a gesture of affection, buried amongst the most familiar shade of brunette hair. Mild green eyes stared placidly out at the viewer, brightened by the soft and attractive smile on the curve of the girl's lips that the spy was well acquainted with. After all, she saw this face in every mirror and reflective surface she walked past every day.

*What is going on?!*",TheCrimsonHart
"[WP] The spy infiltrating the enemy base is surprised to find that the guards are not trying to kill him; on the contrary, they seem way too friendly.",DoctorSoda,"Hearing the approaching footsteps, I slipped into the shadow, and pressed my body against the wall.  *Surely, my gray sleeksuit will keep me concealed in this shadow if I just remain still,* I thought.  I watched silently as the three patrollers tromped noisily through the dining hall.

But my eyes met with the last one, and he broke out into a dopey grin.

“There you are!” he squealed.  “Come here!”

I sprung into action, flexing my genetically superior legs to leap effortlessly onto the dining table in one bound, then across it in another.  I ran into the next room, leaving my pursuer to wend his way around the obstacle.

I scanned the kitchen, desperately seeking a place to hide.  No good choices presented themselves – not enough room behind the refrigerator, the pantry closed and surely sealed shut.  But wait!  One large cupboard near the ceiling was ajar and nearly empty.  I leaped up and extended my climbing claws.  I got an unsteady grip on the cupboard and pulled myself up and into the comforting darkness.

My pursuer stomped into the kitchen and looked around, peeking behind the fridge and looking into the pantry.

“C’mon, sweetie, where are you?” he queried.

He soon broke off his pursuit and rejoined his colleagues.

I hopped down to the floor and took stock of my situation.  I dared not go back through the dining hall, and from my studies of the layout, knew that the door leading from the kitchen to the study was normally kept securely shut.  But footsteps were approaching from the study.  Could this be my opportunity?

I wedged myself into a corner near the door.  *If I begin moving right after he steps through, he won’t be able to grab me, or shut me out,* I thought.  Sure enough, I blazed past him, leaving him with no time to anything more than smile and wave.

I darted quickly through the study.  Mistress Bromley was too engrossed in a book to do anything more than greet me with a cheery “Good evening, cutie!”

At last I arrived at the towering filing cabinet.  *What secrets do you hold?* I mused.  I prepared to take one more leap, when suddenly, I was grabbed from behind!

“Gotcha!” she cried.

I squirmed around until I was face to face with my captor.  It was little Elsie!  She pulled me in for a tight hug, pressing me against her long golden hair.

She hauled me over to an armchair, pushed me into her lap, and began firmly rubbing my sleeksuit, all the way from head to tail.

“Midnight is a good little kitty!” she burbled.

*Very well, Elsie,* I brooded, sinking my head into her lap.  *Your vigilance has won out this time, but next time, my infiltration will succeed!*

As Elsie scratched the top of my head, I closed my eyes, and let out an involuntary purr.

"[WP] ""Why do you even bother trying to save something like me?""",EndToStart,"I don't have any story to tell David. My life, my younger years were blessed. I had good parents, still send me birthday cards with notes I thought were cringe worthy as a teenager and now can't enjoy enough. I went to good schools, was educated by impassioned teachers who cared about me. Found someone who loved me, have kids who adore me. There's nothing about my life that equates to yours, no common ground.

There are two dead people, about a mile away that, if you live through this day, will be used to send you to a prison for the rest of your natural life, and prison life, well, its far from enviable.

So I suppose on the whole I don't have much to offer, no comforting words, no it'll get better speeches. If you live through today your life will probably continue to be hard, with depression wracking your every step and no future to look forward to. So if you jump, into those cold waters below, I'll understand, and I'll be envious.

The wind whipped upwards through the support beams of the bridge and David's exasperation was almost lost among the whistle, ""What?""

Envious David, a feeling that comes over me that wishes I had what you already obtain, a desire to take it from you if I but had the courage to.

What?

Tell me what it was like David, tell me how you felt as you saw their eyes turn into their heads and the life, their souls, gasp out for the last time. Did you feel that shiver in your spine, the rush of adrenaline through your blood? Was it not the best you've ever felt in your life!

I...I...

David, I've killed thirteen already, but I feel nothing, nothing at all. No surge, no completeness. I'm empty, I'm hollow. I don't know if I can feel anymore, I dream of that rush, of that tingling and yet am left wanting at every turn.

But you're family, your children...

Lambs to the slaughter David, I'll come to them eventually and see if they can provide any feeling at all, any emotion that I've read so much about. This life is but a waking nightmare for me, an existence devoid of reason, a reality twisted by humanity. I have no such need for your false hopes, your false fears. I will unmake this world, so jump and let me see the red shine upon the waves.

""What the fuck!"" David scrambled upwards upon the support beams and was pulled in by a waiting team of officers and paramedics. People who were kind, people who felt.

Sirens echoed in the coming dusk and a few officers lingered around to control the flow of traffic as the bridge began it's daily rumble of commuters trekking to and from the city.

""Hey Evaline!"" She was up finally from the lower struts of the bridge and taking off the harnesses and wiring meant to keep her safe during the talks with David.

""Hey Kyle!""

""You use the psychopath again this time?""

""Yep""

Kyle looked out over the stream of cars just, passing by, oblivious in their daily routines, ""You're a little bit to good at that you know.""

""Get you worried that someday I'll become the part I play?""

There was a small laugh out from kyle, a mixed laugh both of brushing past a truth and a worry of realization, ""Why is it that you're the only one on the team that can pull that off effectively.""

Kyle turned to meet her gaze and felt in his heart the words she spoke and the truth in them, ""It's in the eyes Kyle, those lazy eyes that show a disregard for any life in this world.""

She smiled broadly and waved, ""Still, whatever gets the job done, right!""

He turned away and then after a moment turned back to answer, but she was gone, in a car somewhere back to make a report of the day.

Those eyes, there was truth in what she said, Kyle knew. Perhaps too much truth, how much was building a scenario and how much was her. Still, wasn't she the best they had? Did it matter how she saved those lives?

Still those eyes, they were, empty. They were hollow. What was she truly? ",schlitzntl

[WP] Today is the day you become something...more.,JacobAlred,"I didn't so much dislike the taste, neither did I like it. It wasn't something I'd ever eaten before, yet it was the most abundant of its kind. Like pork perhaps, a little, I wasn't sure. The cheek they said, try the cheek. So I did.

Killing wasn't my thing, I had empathy, friends, I was even well liked. Killing wasn't in my blood, but I had too. Needed to actually. So I killed him, Eric Tyler. Sexual predator, had a thing for young girls. Really young, children if you must know. I despise child molesters. Preying on the innocent, using it against them. 

He never saw it coming. I befriended him over time, took a while though. But eventually he came over for drinks. He spoke a lot, about this and that. I didn't like him, the talking was too much. As if he was trying to occupy himself, so he wouldn't obsess over innocent kids. 

The evening had progressed and Eric was quite intoxicated when I slit his throat. I came up behind him as I finished in the bathroom. He didn't see it coming, I felt sick to my stomach hearing him try to breathe. A few minutes in he dropped to his knees and drowned in his own blood. Must have been painful, I could see it in his eyes. Even felt a little bad for him, poor fuck.

I only cut off the cheeks, I took both in case I burned one. For years I had waited for this moment. Years.

Frying Eric's cheek felt strange, I even considered becoming vegetarian right there and then. But I didn't. I seasoned it abundantly, hoping it would mask the fact that it was human. It didn't. When I sat down to eat, I was grossly aware of the humanness. Gagging, I took a few bites. Then pushed away the plate. This wasn't some Hannibal Lecter moment where I fafafafafa'd because it would bring comic relief. This was what I wanted. 

I sat at that table for hours staring at the half eaten cheek. Eric was rotting away in my bathroom, but soon none of it would matter.
The wolf pelt I had taken from my grandmother lay thrown over the couch, waiting. 

Eventually I went to bed, just before the sun rose. Remorse creeping up my spine, licking at my conscience. I killed a man for my own selfish needs. Albeit a bad one, I had taken another life. Laying in bed I was wondering if I should've drank red or white with the meat. Which went with which, I could never remember..

An hour or two later I awoke feeling strangely well. I braided my long black hair and headed towards the lounge. The wolf pelt still lay there, waiting. Grabbing it I opened my front door and went out into the reservation. It was early still, with a chill in the air. I headed towards the forest and stopped short of the border heading into it. ""Here goes nothing."" I whispered to myself, and wrapped the pelt around my shoulders. At first I felt nothing but then it was as if everything melted into me and out of me. I felt nauseous, dizzy, and scared. Then it stopped. Realizing I had closed my eyes, I slowly opened them. I was lower to the ground now, and my vision was different. I smelled everything, the trees, the fire burning up north in the reservation, even Eric's corpse. And I heard so much better, people talking in their homes, baby chicks chirping in a nest, and a grasshopper eating nearby.

You've probably said this at some point in your life. You probably meant it, too. It's almost certainly not true, unless you're me. Because if you are, then yes, you're right.

Because it's all my fault. Because you're dying, because of me.

I killed you. No gates or guards can protect against what I made. My first child, my worst child. This horrible thing, this *horrible* thing. I engineered it.

If it makes even the slightest difference, I did it for knowledge. For us, for all of humanity. Trespassing in God's domain. Was it really wrong? How could I know it was wrong, until I did it? Why would it be *there*, unless we were meant to know, to unlock the secrets of life?

But you are coughing, and retching, and dying, and asking you rhetorical questions will give me no answers. You wouldn't believe me, anyway. I can see the twinkling of my child in your eyes, and of course you don't believe me.

I don't know why I don't die. 

I think it might be punishment. I blink, and another generation passes, and the answer still escapes me...

Concrete canyons litter the deserted metropolis reaching fair into the sky, men, women, and children all lay on the freezing ground, left alone to die,not cared for, no space for them in a grave, like they were a meaningless object. Forests once vibrant with broad wildlife are now filled with death and dusk that I have caused. Through the madmen that once called themselves ""Scientists"" I was forged. Deep down in underground laboratories. They were once work spaces, where hundreds of people came to carry out their job. Now they're a mere metal graveyard.

Through my fault I have destroyed this once thriving planet. I was the carrier, I am the carrier, I will remain the carrier, of the plague that ended planet Earth. No one is here anymore. Only me. I can go anywhere, do anything, but no living thing can accompany me, no one to care for me, no one I can care for either. 

Humanity never knew if there was life beyond our planet. And if there wasn't, well I am the only living thing to exist at this moment. Feels strange, like I shouldn't be the one to take on this role, like it's not my body.

The planet will most likely die soon. And with it, me. The forests are dying, not being pollinated by bees. The very lungs of the Earth are decaying and I can't do nothing but wait and until that time comes,

I was never a people person. I was never an anything person. I kept to myself by choice in hopes of avoiding interaction with anyone or anything. Now it's not really my choice at all.

It all started about six months ago. Life was normal, I went about my day seeing very few people. The few people I did see started getting sick. Like *really* sick, and soon they began to drop like flies. Of course I had no idea I was causing any of this, I felt fine. Soon the people I infected began to infect other people. More and more people became ill, and many more died until everyone was gone. All because of me.

It's a terrible feeling knowing you were the last human on Earth. It's an even worse feeling knowing you killed every other human. Being alone used to be something I desired more than anything else, but now it's the worst pain I could experience.

[WP] You are having the worst day ever. It's seemingly just one infomercial disaster after another.,Mindriot07,"I limped into the kitchen.

""Honey, the toilet paper is--"" my mouth hung open searching for the words, ""sandpaper"" I hissed.

""I'll get some more later,"" her eyes did not look up from the laptop.

""Is this coffee fresh?""

""Mmm-hmm.""

I reached for the pot, but for some reason I slapshoted the pot right off the counter with an open hand. The pot crashed on the floor, the hot liquid singing my bare feet.

Upon hearing my cries of terror my wife hurried into the kitchen. She helplessly watched as I slipped and fell into the growing puddle of coffee, rolling around in it like a child who has caught fire.

""Why would you wear your whitest shirt?"" my wife shrieked. 

""I will clean this up,"" I promised. Small patches of blood from the broken glass clashed with the light brown stains of coffee on my whitest shirt.

I located the mop and began mopping the puddle. To my anguish the mop merely spread around the shards of glass and coffee, absorbing none of it. I had no time, I was running late for work. Today, however, was no ordinary day of work. It was ""wear your whitest shirt to work"" day, the biggest office holiday of the spring season. I had two minutes to get these stains out.

Rushing to the blank white bottle that read ""stain remover"" I emptied the clear liquid onto my shirt. Oh the destitution! The stains got worse. I was running out of options.

I swung open the door to my closet but could not find a single viable white shirt in the clutter and disorganization. There was no room for anything.

""That's it!"" I wailed to the Gods, ""I am taking a sick day.""

Still shirtless, I made my way to the couch and turned on the television. I was so cold but did not want to raise my heating bill, therefore I flung a big red blanket over myself. 

""Uh-oh,"" my eyes widened. I had to call my boss to tell him I wasn't coming into work, but that would require me to take my hands out of the blanket and into the cold. There were no other options. My arm was practically numb by the time it reached my phone, my fingers too stiff to dial the numbers. 

The whole office waited for me, waiting to start the whitest shirt festivities. I never walked through those doors. Instead I laid limp halfway off of the couch, wailing for help with a hypothermic voice that held no air.

[WP] You are having the worst day ever. It's seemingly just one infomercial disaster after another.,Mindriot07,"""Not again!"" you exclaim to no one in particular, since you were alone in your typical 2-bedroom home in the suburbs. You set your alarm, but there was a power outage in the middle of the night that caused it to reset. If only there were a better way! Your thoughts drifted to the late-night infomercial you watched as you fell asleep, and you could swear you remember something about an external power source for alarm clocks... But who has money for that? Not you! Your boss said that if you were late for any more ridiculous reason, you'd be suspended without pay. 

You decide to get up anyway and go to work to try to convince him to let you keep working. As you put your feet on the cold, hardwood floor, the shock of the cold causes you to gasp in over exaggerated surprise. Your hands even flail a bit, but you don't notice. This is the worst thing to wake up to in the morning! You scour your head for a solution to this problem- and you again remember an infomercial from your late-night insomnia induced television binges. Yes, the Warm 'Em Ups (TM). A special slipped that you plug in before you go to sleep, and they stay warm until you unplug them! 

Shaking these thoughts of expensive products from your sleepy mind, you wander over to the bathroom for a quick shower. You don't need that frivolous crap right now. You throw a towel into the room and look at yourself in the mirror. Such a sad face. What a terrible way to set the mood for the day. What if you had a way to fix that? Now you do, with the Mirror Magic Press-Ons(C)!  They are reusable stickers to brighten your mirror so you never have to be sad in the mornings again! Now available in face shapes, critters, flowers, and emojis!

Ugh. Where did that thought come from? You are having the worst day ever. It's seemingly just one infomercial disaster after another. 

The day continues, but instead of diminishing, the disasters become worse. They begin happening in succession without break. In a desperate bid to stop at least one disaster, you cave and dial the toll free number conveniently listed at the end of one such infomercial. 1-800-RID-BUGS, you dial. ""Hello, yes, I'd like one can of RidBugs(TM) with the free sample of RidPests for an additional shipping and handling charge, please,"" you beg into your phone. 

For the next few hours, nothing happens. You are able to function as a normal human being without the need for overly expensive, unnecessary gadgets. But, as soon as you enter your kitchen and try to open a can of soda, the contents immediately spray all over you and your brand new, white shirt. ""Come on!"" you exclaim, wishing you had purchased the Clamp Tops during the special introductory offer of 12 for two easy payments of $19.99 (plus S&amp;H.) Well, maybe it's not too late? You dial the number and order a couple, just in case. 

Sweet peace returns to you briefly, but it is short lived. Eventually you notice that the only relief from embarrassment and untimely catastrophes is when you are ordering gizmos from an infomercial. Yes... Maybe if you have them all, then you can finally be prepared for anything? Yes, this makes sense. You need them all. They are all necessary.

The dim glow of the television casts shadows over your gaunt face as you speak into the receiver in your phone. The silky caress of the voice on the other line enraptures you: ""Hello, would you like to hear about our additional offers?""",frogs_4_eva

The time had finally come for revelations, and man would need to pay for his sin. His white robes, brighter that the brightest light, flapped in the wind, his massive beard stretching down to his waist. A halo sat atop his head, a golden ring of perfection. ""It is time, Lucifer."" God said to the man standing next to him. The devil looked back at God, smiling. He didn't look how most imagined him. He was an older looking man, thin but fit. He wore a deep blue suit, and a pair of round-framed glasses. 

""This is what we have been waiting for, Clarence."" The Devil said. ""I told you never to call me by my name!"" God shouted ""It's God, Lucifer, man you're an ass."" The Devil smiled, looking back down on the world. ""I finally get the earth, and you get the the true believers."" The Devil said with a smile. ""My time has finally come.""

Macho Man sat atop his throne, leg casually thrown over the side of the arm rest. He wore a yellow and pink skin tight suit with yellow tassels hanging from the arms. His cowboy hat rested atop his head, alternating colors to match. A massive Heavy Weight Champion belt around his waist. ""It's time, ooooh yeeeah."" he whispered.

He was surrounded by the best. Hulk Hogan, Andre the Giant, The Honky Tonk Man, Big Boss Man. They had all decided that Macho was the best chance earth had. The WWF was a secret organization going back thousands of years, finding the greatest fighters to fend off the end of time. Macho Man descended the steps, stepping into an ornate ring. The other wrestlers climbed the ropes, standing at the top looking down at him, a look of respect in each mans eye. ""It's time,"" Macho man said. ""the match the whole world, Jupiter, Saturn , Venus... Or anywhere else is waiting for."" With that, the other wrestlers sent him to Heaven above, each man doing Macho Man's signature elbow drop; his body exploded from the impact. 

God raised his hand, ready to signal to begin. The Angels of war stood ready, the Four Horseman trotting impatiently. The sky flashed above God. He looked up, startled. The WWF had sent their champion. Macho Man Randy Savage exploded out of a burst of light, elbow dropping the Horseman of death in two as he landed. ""We're in space and space is the place!!"" He shouted as death exploded under his elbow. 

""Who are you?"" God shouted in anger, and perhaps, just perhaps, a hint of fear. 
""Best there is... past, present and future! Ohhhhh yeahhhh!"" Macho Man shouted, suplexing one of Gods angels. This force was greater than god had ever seen. Macho man leg dropped Pestilence, his head exploding under Macho Man's boot. Famine turned to run, but was hit with short-arm clothesline, ripping his body in two. ""What right do you have to bring violence into the Kingdom of God!"" God shouted at Macho Man.

Macho Man smiled, covered in the blood of gods soldiers. ""Expect the unexpected in the kingdom of madness!"" He shouted it return, flipping Famine upside-down, crushing his head in a vicious pile driver. ""Oooooooh Yeeeeeah!"" Macho Man bellowed his battle cry. War raised his sword to strike, but was knocked from his horse from a powerful double slap. War maintained his footing, but was dispatched by a Spinning headlock elbow drop. God and the Devil found themselves alone suddenly. ""Do something, Clarence!"" The Devil shouted in fear.
""My heavenly powers have no effect on him!"" God replied, obviously scared. 

Macho Man lifted the devil above his head. ""The madness is runnin' wild!"" He screamed, shattering the devil with a wicked back-breaker, tossing his body off the cloud to the world below. ""YOU CANNOT DO THIS!"" God screamed, pointing at Macho Man. Mach Man smiled, shouting ""The tower of power, too sweet to be sour, ohhhh yeahh!"" A massive corner of a wrestling ring began to rise below him, raising him into the sky. ""OOOOOOOOOH YEEEEEEEAH"" He shouted, elbow dropping God off of the cloud, falling to earth faster than anything had before. Flames engulfed God as he screamed, the power of Macho Man being too mighty, even for the creator of Heaven and Earth. Theystruck the ground, a massive shock wave destroying everything within 1000 miles. Macho Man stood, placing Gods halo on his head, the only piece of God that survived the attack. ""What can I say about that move? Nothing so I won't."" he said, ascending to heaven. 

The angels didn't know what to do. God was gone, who would lead them? Who would answer prayers of the people? Who would watch over the world? The Pearly Gates flew open from a powerful kick. Macho Man Randy Savage, God's halo on his head, ascended to the golden throne. He sat, throwing his leg over the edge of the chair. Slim Jims began to rain from the sky. The angels were in awe, since God never let them eat meat. The angels waited for him to speak.

""Too hot to handle, too cold to hold! Ten thousand years as Intercontinental Champion, Oooooh yeeeah!"" He said. The angels bowed, and man would live to see another day, under the watchful eye of the Almighty, our Savior, Macho Man Randy Savage.

Here are some flowers and a boulder I picked up myself.”

“Oh, thank you Edward!”  Bella grabbed his arm and let her vampire boyfriend lead her to class.  “The flowers smell so pretty and I love that you can pick up a boulder and fly me around on your back and also you smell pretty too.”

“Hey guys!” 

“Oh our best friend Jacob is here!” Bella cried out.  “I'm so glad he is both of our best friends and also it makes sense for him to go to this high school even though he lives on a reservation, because this story is all about fixing everything wrong with Twilight and also I'm blind.”

Edward blinked.  “What did you just say?”

“Blind,” Bella repeated.  “You haven't noticed before?  I thought vampires were supposed to be like, really observant and super smart.”

“No, not that part,” Edward said, sounding very old with his choice of language since he was born a very long time ago when people talked funny.  “The part about this being a story.”

Bella also blinked.  “I don't know.  It just came out.  It sounded right though, didn't it?”

“What's going on?” Jacob asked, drooling a little.  

Edward took out a napkin that he was carrying for some reason and dabbed at Jacob's mouth in a kind of erotic, but not too erotic way.  It was kind of erotic.  “Bella thinks we may be in a story.”

“What?  Like Goldilocks and the three bears?  I'm not a *bear*, Edward, jeez, I'm a wolf.”  Jacob stopped talking, his jaw going slack.  “But what if this is the story of the wolf and the three little pigs?  I don't want to blow on someone's house until it falls over.  What am I going to do Edward?  Please help me, I am your best friend and also Bella is totally self sufficient for a blind girl even though I know nothing about being blind.”

Edward shook his head slowly from side to side, smiling crookedly and pinching the bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger.  “I don't think we're supposed to be best friends.”

“What does that supposed to mean?  I mean, what is we supposed to be then?  I mean...”  Jacob paused, scratching his ear rapidly.

“I mean, I think we're supposed to be rivals.”

“Rivals?  Like why?”

“For Bella,” Edward explained.

“We're supposed to fight over this blind girl?”  Jacob was confused.  “But we're all friends.  Why would we do that?”

“She's not supposed to be blind,” replied Edward.  “Bella, can you see me?”

Bella blinked.  “Of course.  You're gorgeous and an Adonis and perfect.  There's no reasonable way I could know what you look like to describe your perfect features every third sentence if I were blind.”

“She's cured!  It's a miracle!”  Mike Newton started falling on the floor shaking and screaming when he realized Bella could see.  He wasn't really in this story before, and he won't be again.

Jacob continued to just sort of stand around, staring at the water fountain and wondering how does it work.

“Come on Bella, let's go figure all this out,” Edward said, handing Bella her binoculars.  He'd always wondered why she had binoculars if she was blind.

“Okay, but I'm driving.  You drive very fastly and it makes me scared.  Why don't you ever let me drive?  It's because I'm a girl, isn't it?  You sexist pig, I'm just as able as you!”

“I... But... You... Wait, you're still a high school girl, and I'm still a 100 year old vampire pretending to be a high school boy?”  Edward looked perplexed as they walked through the parking lot.

“Yes, your point?”  Bella chewed on her lower lip.

“So... All those things I thought didn't make sense, and they turned out to not make sense because this was a poorly written story...”

“What now?  I need to get home and cook dinner for my father, with whom I suddenly decided to live  and neither of my parents actually stepped in and took control of the situation.”

Edward blinked.  “Yes.  Yes, you go on home and I'll... I'll go to my family of 100 year old vampires who somehow have managed to fly under the radar in an increasingly technologically-dependent society and continue coming up with entirely implausible cover stories that don't hold up to the tiniest bit of scrutiny.”  Edward shook his head.  “I suppose it's too much to ask for a better calibur writer to take over this story?”

“What should we do, Father?” 

“We must go.  We cannot insult the Volturi.  I must warn you though, the road will be dangerous.  We're probably going to die.

The once dead body is now standing. I look at it and a strange feeling comes over me, one I haven't felt...

""Bravo young one."" Xyrell speaks in his normally booming voice. ""You, boy, have just raised your first undead...how do you feel?"" ""P-Proud."" I say, exhausted. ""You didn't tell me it would hurt that much."" Xyrell studying me, says, ""Well the first time always hurts... You'll get used to it.""

Then a voice says in a soft, calm tone, ""I hurt.""

Xyrell and I both jump and look around; nobody else should be in the summoning chamber. ""Who's there?"" Xyrell demands. I look around and the undead body starts walking towards me, in a way thrall have never done before. A walk that wasn't fumbly or uncoordinated...it was calculated, composed.

""I hurt too."" The thrall speaks.

Surprised I ask, ""How are you speaking husk?"" It walks closer and closer approaching me as close as only one foot away from my face.

""Because of you, necromancer."" It says.

Xyrell is stunned and silent, merely watching the two of us speak. I look from Xyrell back onto the thrall and ask, ""Do you know who you are?""

""All I know is pain."" It says

""What are you?!"" Xyrell booms, ""No undead can speak, much less think!"" His statement begins my trembling. If Xyrell knows this doesn't happen then I know for sure that I have done something that hasn't ever been done. 

""I am not an undead, sorcerer."" He speaks.

The husk steps away from me and starts pacing around the room, inspecting all the tools and instruments around the chamber. With every moment that passes, the husk looks less and less dead. His skin turned a light pink from a pale grey, his bones have stopped bending, and muscles are no longer torn, his eyes are full and bright and holds depth to them...they are observant and intelligent. This scares me the most.

The risen man grabs onto a long steel rod and slowly turns towards us, Xyrell is slowly making his way to the staircase at the back of the chamber. I start doing the same.

""Don't leave. We have much to discuss...""

I make a break for the stairs, Xyrell closely behind me. I sprint up the stairs as I hear the loud, unmistakable sound of tearing flesh. I look back to see Xyrell impaled from behind. The man bends down, placing his hand over Xyrell's face and chanting words in some unknown language. The body of my friend shrivels into a featureless skeleton as the man's body looked more lively...more human.

I am paralyzed in fear as the man steps over Xyrell's corpse and makes his way towards me. I sprint up the remaining stairs and scramble for the door key. I drop the key chain and quickly bend down to grab it... But another hand beats me to it. 

The man's hand grasps onto the keys slowly raising it to his side. I press my back against the door and await the inevitable. He raises his hand and I quickly close my eyes, cringing. I then feel the cold metal on my skin, as he places the keys into my hand. I am paralyzed in fear, happiness, disbelief...relief.

""Tell the mages what you saw here today."" The man speaks. ""Tell them your power, and show them your capabilities.""

Dazed and confused I let out a reluctant, ""What?"" He looks me in the eye with a strong, constant gaze. I realize his face is completely human now, body still partially mangled, but whole.

""The power you hold isn't necromancy...it is something greater."" He whispers.

He slowly walks backwards down the stairs, not dropping eye contact with me. I stare at him for a minute then turn to unlock the door. It clicks and I quickly push it open. I feel the cold outside air on my face for a moment. Then, I sprint as fast as I can towards the necromancer's citadel.

My Words carry far and the Flame grows higher, the Master's smiles light up the Spire.

Greeted with silence the corpse lies still; a deafening silence, an omen so ill.

The Masters shuffle and their focus falters, frozen in fear atop their altars.

A quiet Cold invades these halls, these shivers I've never felt with normal thralls.

I breath deep to chant once more, but choking on ice I hit the floor.

The Flame grows thin, starting to extinguish. A chuckling malice begins my anguish.

Masters stand in a crescent of eight, in gruesome ends they meet their fate.

One explodes in a bloody mist, the second drowns in her bursting cysts.

The third collapses in a pile of ash. The fourth croaks, his throat a gash.

The fifth turns white from rapid age. His eyes freeze white, still glowing with rage.

The sixth and seventh consumed by madness, feast on each other with absentmindedness.

The final Master, our eldest mystic, murmurs words so strange and cryptic.

She walks alone moving towards the corpse, that moves not an inch yet kills without remorse.

Priestess Mira's brows furl into a scowl, her whispers grow louder into a frenzied howl.

Her voice is hers but two others still speak, all three in unison begin to shriek. 

One voice, a bellow, resounding deep into the crypt. The other, a shrill, as if a throat being ripped.

Once more I feel the Cold within spread. By sunrise I know, I will be dead.

Yet Mira walks with three voices still chanting. They struggle to resist, and give way to panting.

Only now the corpse stands and moves, its footsteps betray cloven hooves. 

It stands before Mira, now on her knees. The Cold given life, now a gentle breeze. 

Extending a finger to her scowling face, she fades away staring into space. 

Despite her strength and tenacious persistence, the strongest of us was erased from existence.

This *thing* starts to turn its gaze toward mine, the Cold a shiver running down my spine.

I start to accept that my time has drawn to an end, I - ""If only that were true, my poor friend.""

#Achoo#

Rein sneezed off to the side as he finished setting down the gopher dust around the cadaver. Quickly wiping his sleeve across his nose, he muttered the next words required in the incantation. He stood, and glanced around the dark antechamber. Strictly speaking, he wasn't supposed to be here; it was after curfew, and the fact that he was practicing necromancy at the witching hour wouldn't help matters. But Rein didn't care. One test stood between him and an Accolade, a near prerequisite for anyone looking for a stellar career in the Ministry of Mystics. Necromancy was not his strong suit-blame it on his squeamishness or what have you-and he wasn't confident in his grasp of it through mere theory. He needed practical application, which unfortunately, meant a late night raid on the university morgue and an illegal ritualistic summoning in a test chamber. 

Rein's voice crescendoed as he neared the rituals end, and tried not to look at the unnaturally stiff figure in the center of the room. He closed his eyes as he spoke the last rite. There was a sound like electricity sparking, a dull, humming sound that blew through the room. Then he heard something move just before him. He opened his eyes. 

The corpse stood in the center of the rite circle, pale, steaming, swaying on decayed limbs. Rein smiled, and tapped his thumb against the outside of his nostril as was his habit when he was particularly self-satisfied. His smile drooped as he took in the product of his creation however. The cadaver had been dead over a weak. Preservatives had kept it intact, but it was painfully thin, with skin as paper thin as its death shroud stretched too tight across bones, and the dark imprint of dead veins clear against the startling white. It's eyes stared at nothing and everything, glazed over in death, completely devoid of the spark of life. A biological machine now, nothing more. Rein shuddered, and looked away as he recalled one of the commands he would be required to give it.

""Thrall *nie*, take one step to the right."" 

It didn't move. Didn't even shift. It stood there, impassive, immobile. Still dead, just standing now. Rein sighed, and reached for his text book to see whether the command was wrong or worse yet, if he'd made a mistake in the summoning. 

The eyes moved.

He caught the movement out if the corner of his eye, and froze like a rabbit under the stair of a hawk. The glazed orbs were staring right at him, and something was wrong. Something was so familiar within them, yet alien and strange within that dead mask. Rein's heart caught in his throat, his eyes pivoting just enough to take in the scene. The jaw dropped open.

It started screaming.

The Thing-for it was no thrall-wailed in a dull, haunting tone, an otherworldly note wrapped around decaying vocal chords. The scream was so loud and raw that it seemed as if it were unintelligible, yet Rein had the impression of a word, a single word drawn endlessly out.

""BACK!""

Rein lept as if he'd been scalded, falling hard against the wall behind him. The Thing  began to advance on him, painfully slow on its rotting limbs, but coming, screaming, clutching it's shriveled head in hands that no longer worked. Rein began to shake, unable to move, unable to breath, his vision clouding around the terrible visage that was stepping across the ritual circle. 

""*Lepsid!*"" 

Rein caught one last look at the Thing's terrible, murderous eyes before it crumbled into a pile of dust. Professor Yoseph stepped forward through the debris, his eyes alight with rage. The two sat in their positions for what seemed an age. When Yoseph spoke, it was controlled, and cool.

""Do you know what that was?""

Rein shook his head, his eyes not leaving the Professor. 

""That was a wight. A mortal soul trapped in a dead body. A most excruciating experience for said soul. Interrogators use it as a tactic against those from whom they want information by summoning their deceased loved ones in such a manner. A ghastly cruelty for all involved. And now, through an act of tragic irresponsibility, you've joined their ranks pupil."" He pointed at the pile of dust. ""Remember the look in his eyes the next time you try your hand at one of our darkest arts. The next time you commit an act of insubordination to get ahead of your fellows. Remember the price he paid for your habits. The price you pay as well. You hold a power near to the gods themselves in your heart. And you would brandish it like an open flame?"" 

He turned away from the ashen student, straihtning his robes. ""You will be held back a full grade, and repeat your thirteenth year. You will not graduate with your fellows. Henceforth, letters of recommendation from anyone of an appointment above custodian will pass through my office first for my arbitration as to whether the letter is truly due. Do you understand?""

""I...I thought I'd done it...correctly."" Rein whispered hoarsely.

""You sneezed."" Yoseph replied flatly. ""It takes but a single hemlock petal to poison a feast, young pupil. Perfection is always the order of the day. Perfection, not pride."" 

As Yoseph left, a breeze blew through the chamber, stirring the dust where the wight had been. Rein choked down the urge to sneeze as he left shivering uncontrollably from the chamber.",blakester731

"[WP] ""Only Human.""",Scherazade,"The burning wreckage of the colony was a scene from the Nth Hell of Kranish.  Bodies were scattered everywhere.  Burnt corpses.  Dead sentients.  Scorched rubble.  Shattered dreams and rendered nightmares.

I contemplated the symbology on the wall before me.  Simplistic and meant to be pedagogical.  The scene, my AI assistant informed me, was meant to have a positive charge for those still underdeveloped, not yet fully aware or maximized.  

I moved forward through the shattered building.  This place would be ripe with the scent songs of the recyclers within days.  The bodies were plentiful and we would make no attempt to interfere with the natural cycle of things.  That was not our way.

My battle armour hummed maneuvering me through the areas still intact enough to have a roof.  There was very little of that.  The biomimic mechanical tentacles of the suit lashed out to grasp the walls and progressed me through the ravished ruins.

So many dreams shattered.  So many color songs ended.  So many acoustic scents never to be wafted. I was not at ease.  

Our invasion was a resounding and overwhelming success.  We had taken this world.  The resistance was easily overwhelmed.  We had crushed our enemy.

Yet the more I toured our victory, I, the grand commander of the Unformed's army, my internals shifted from uneasy to worried to fearful...to...

I was placing a pseudopod on the feeling when I overheard some of the soldiery, low rank and undercultured, only having had fifth hand bio-mental sharings with the grand thinkers.  They were discussing the victory as grunts from a million cultures had done before and would do again until the sky grew cold and the last sentient scent summoned us home.

I stopped to listen and caught the final comment as to why we had won and taken this world, this colony, won this victory.

The sentients, after all, were ""Only Human.""

I knew the feeling I had felt and my formless form shivered.  For I could finally place the tendril on the tenuous feeling I had had over our victory.

[IP] A Girl and Her Dragon,SpyderEyez,"Scarlet, like red spider lilies. The color her mother loved. Akoúo ran her fingers through her red hair, glancing down at the kingdom below. Her world was swept in dark crimson and the redolence of fire and metal. 

She remembered fondly her early days in the castle. How could she forget? The taste of apple cider and cinnamon, grapes fresh from the vine, and the richly ashen flavor of smoked wood that seeped into the pork and the beef. She loved the festivals and her mother’s sweet lullabies at twilight.

“Akoúo, my princess, do not listen to the ones who threaten you because you are my daughter. You are loved, and I will protect you, for all that I have and all that I am is for you.”

How could she forget? The kingdom she despised so passionately for raining death upon her castle. Her mother fought their rebellion, but not even her magic could end an army of thousands. They had taken her mother away from her forever, impaled her with a sword through her heart as she had thrown her body over her daughter to protect her. They had destroyed her crown, usurped her throne, and announced with wicked cheers that the reign of the witches was no more. 

She had crawled out from under the body of her mother, tears mixing with blood, although she did not know if it was hers or her mother's. The girl ran away, escorted deep into the mountains by her caretaker to be raised in the safety of solitude. But how could she forget? The taste of coppery blood on her lips and the sound of the castle crumbling to the ground. She yearned for it again, and she knew she would not be satisfied until she had tasted the pleasure of vengeance. The girl called upon her caretaker.

“No—Akoúo, your mother would never have wanted revenge. Your powers as a witch were meant to be used in goodwill, for the sake of others. Child, the world is not kind, but you must always remember your mother’s love for you and live how she wanted you to live, with courage, fidelity, and compassion even in the face of adversity.”

So she took her words to heart and left her caretaker’s body in her own blood as a sacrifice for the beast. Her opulent white dress was stained in scarlet, and she howled with delighted laughter. The frenzied winds joined her as the beast descended from the clouds with powerful, sweeping wings. 

*Ah…*

Akoúo flashed a greedy smile, and the beast screeched into the night, ravenously gorging on the carcass of her caretaker. Its back was pierced by spears and swords and its eyes glowed with violent hatred. How could she forget? The kingdom, in its fear, had set a bounty for the death of this beast although it had once protected its citizens from harm.

“You are just like me. Abandoned by a world that is governed by terror.” She crooned, caressing its scales and nursing its wounds. “I have summoned you for a purpose, Miló. If they are only swayed by fear, then we must give them something to fear. Let us paint the whole kingdom in death.”

It growled and gnashed its teeth and accepted the woman’s touch, their gazes filled with mutual understanding and the ambiance of fervent bloodlust.

[IP] A Girl and Her Dragon,SpyderEyez,"Blood ran down the stone, thick and viscous, melting its acidic path to the natural crevice that was our shelter. Dozens of arrows and spears jutted out of his back, silver tips turning the scales into golden teardrops. The air around us rippled with heat, each pulse blurring my vision. Sweat coated my back and face. I took a deep breath and looked up, forced myself to meet his red eyes, eyes that swirled with chaos and knowledge and power I could not comprehend. My heart slowed, trying to hide itself in the face of certain death. My legs tightened, rooted to the spot.

""Darion!"" I called out, my voice high-pitched and breaking, ""I thought we had agreed you wouldn't attack humans!"" He stared back for a moment.

**""NO ATTACK. SOMETHING FOR YOU. FOR US.""**

He did not open his mouth to speak. Instead, each word dug itself into my mind, shredding through every thought and emotion there. I swayed, my mouth wordlessly opening, as every part of my body froze at the impossible loudness. For a long moment I was a stuck branch in the river of time, helpless in uncomprehending fear by Darion's power. 

But as always, emotions and thoughts flooded back, agonizing pain leading the way. I dropped to my knees as my head pounded, gasping as tears ran down my face. A far-off sound came to me: Darion's tail furiously smashing against the stone. His form of apology. He sat there, unblinking, watching me pant and shake, but his claws tightened angrily and his wings trembled in agitation. At last I stood up, wiping my face on my shoulder.

""Thank... thank you for not killing anyone. Show me... show me what you brought."" My breathing finally slowed. Darion carefully leaned forward until his nose was level with me, then slowly opened his mouth. 

Rows and rows of gleaming fangs longer than my arm emerged, each impossibly sharp. My instincts cowered and wailed and beat inside my head, triggering every primal fear humans ever had. But I clenched my fists and stepped forward, staring into the maw opening in front of me. Hot air rushed out from his cavernous throat, sending flakes of golden dragonfire into the air that eagerly swarmed around me. Each one sent a pinprick of terrible pain where it landed, but I bit my lip until I drew blood and stared forward, unmoving. As always, the sparks grew bored and fluttered off into the night.

Darion's massive acid-coated tongue suddenly rose to the roof of his mouth. On the bottom of his mouth was a small white bundle, somehow completely unharmed. Keenly aware of the deadly teeth below me, I tentatively reached in and grabbed the bundle. As soon as my arms were clear he drew back, snapping his mouth shut, waiting for my reaction. But for once I was not looking at him.

A baby slept peacefully in my arms, sucking on his thumb. His head was already covered in hair, neatly combed and black. I looked up at Darion furiously. ""You stole a baby?! For *me*?""

He shook his head, tail gnashing again as he sought for a way to explain without words. ""Why do you think I need a baby? I left my people to find you, to make peace between our people! How could you possibly think-""

**""NOT STOLE. SAVED. HE IS THE ONE.""**

I hadn't even realized I had fallen to my knees before I struggled up again, somehow ignoring the headache that once more wrapped me in a spiderweb of pain. ""The One? What do you mean?""

**""DRAGONBROTHER. HE IS PEACE. HE IS-""**

Suddenly, a new sound ripped through his words, a horrible scream that sent my muscles spasming in fear and agony. The boy fell from my hands as I writhed on the ground, convulsing. I wanted nothing more than death, to burn a thousand times over, for existence itself to end, for- 

Darion reared up on the stone with a furious roar that rose up against the wave of sound, that somehow beat it back, muted it to a whine that thrashed and flailed all around us. I sat up, gasping. Slivers of the stone were peeled off. Blood ran down my neck and soaked my dress. My hands couldn't stop shaking. Nearby trees splintered and shattered. Far above us, another form circled. Another dragon.

**""GO! KEEP HIM SAFE! RUN!""** His command held none of its usual power, whipped away by the scream that began gaining speed again, greedily burrowing into us. Darion whirled around furiously and roared again as he began to rise, his mighty wingbeats stirring massive rushes of air. Shaking, I picked up the baby - who had somehow remained asleep - and began to run. Dragonbrother in my hands or not, staying here meant certain death.",ChessClue

You don't recognize the name but the picture is of you in middle school, and you've been missing for over 10 years apparently.",TwistedSic,"I wasn't hoping for some sort of miraculous revelation when I went out to the store. I was never the sort of guy that miraculous revelations happened to. I just lived my normal-Joe, everyman life in suburban America, working as an accountant for ASCEND CORP.


But when you see something like that, it grips you like a vice and makes you reconsider everything you hold dear.


Now, you're probably thinking: Dean, buddy, what did you see? A horrific accident which revealed the blood, guts and brain matter of a poor, innocent stranger? Your 10/10 would bang ex-girlfriend making out with your best friend, the guy you've been mates with since preschool? Or perhaps an obese lady descending her mobility scooter to take a gigantic shit in the middle of aisle 14 (helpfully labeled 'Cleaning Supplies')? Nope, none of those. Instead, I saw a picture of me in middle school. I recognised the picture. It had been taken when I turned 12, a veritable cringe-fest of 'scene' and 'random lol xd'. Why would my 12 year old, acne-riddled face be in a grocery store? Were the owners stalkers? Was this a prank? 


Then, something else hit me in the way Stormtrooper bullets don't. It was my face, sure, but the name printed below my picture read ""Ian Somerheider"". And the single, all-caps word printed above the picture read ""MISSING SINCE 23/6/05"". 


I wasn't missing! I was standing right here!


I took the poster down and walked to the nearest sales attendant. He grunted, not pleased that I had interrupted his thirty-seventh attempt at level 14 of Candy Crush. 

""Hey, man. Who is this kid?"" I asked. The man grunted.

""Can't you read, chump? Ian Somerheider. 12 year old kid from the other side of the country. Kidnapped 10 years ago. Never seen again. The cops reckon they've seen someone that looks like him round here. Bollocks is what I think. Poor bastard's probably lying in a pond somewhere, waiting for some unlucky fisherman to pluck him out,""

""But-but- that's a picture of me!"" I stuttered, incredulous.

""Can't be. Told ya, the kiddo's dead. Although you do bear some kinda passing resemblance,""


Still, I felt uneasy. I distinctly remembered my early childhood spent in a place that wasn't here. Possibly all the way across the country. But I hadn't been kidnapped!

That night, I was thinking about the poster. Someone had probably just found the wrong picture, that was all. It was true that I'd lived all the way in LA when I was a kid, but I remembered moving after middle school, not during. I thought more. My parents had divorced when I was 9, and my family life had been dysfunctional ever since. Dad skipped home the second the papers were signed, and my once bubbly, active mom turned into an alcoholic, hungover until the afternoon, then going out to the pub again after I came home from school. She'd died of alcohol poisoning when I was 12. *12?* No, it couldn't be, I told myself. Coincidence does not equal correlation. 


Then what next? 


I fell asleep before I could delve deeper into my memories.

[WP] Write about the end of the world from the perspective of a blind person.,Vertiburrd,"The day started off just as any normal day would. My alarm clock shook my bed until I nearly fell out, then I turned it off and got up to go walk to the shower-- the usual. I just moved into my new apartment for a job I got here in Chicago, Illinois working at an insurance firm. The insurance firm isn't one of the TV ones. They specialize in business insurance rather than life insurance or health insurance. They also do a bit of niche insurance. Drivers who often get into car accidents and have a bad record are barred from using the normal insurance, so they have to come to us. It's actually quite profitable. I don't drive, though, I'm legally blind.

On my way to the shower I tripped over something on the ground and stumbled a bit. I can't quite make out what it is. It's some sort of round object. I suppose it must be a ball I just left lying around, but I don't remember ever moving it. I toss it out of the way and make my way to the shower. Naturally, since I'm blind, I have to take many precautions that other people don't have to. I have everything in my apartment arranged in a very efficient way, so I know where everything is. The shaving cream is always to the right of the bathroom sink next to my razor, the shampoo is placed to the left of the conditioner on the highest shelf in my bathroom, and so on. It can be a pain, but I've gotten used to doing stuff like that now.

I step into the bathtub and turn the water on. As soon as I do, cold water comes rushing out of the top of the shower. Immediately I recoil from the cold and turn the water off. For some reason I left the device that controls where the water goes up so the water went to the shower. Strange. In the past I've always remembered to push it down. Oh well, I must have forgotten. I push the device down and turn the water back on, then wait for the water to run warm before pushing the device back up again. Next I go for the shampoo on the highest shelf. I feel for two bottles and grab the one left. When I squeeze the bottle, to my surprise a liquid that smells an awful lot like my conditioner comes out. Apparently I switched the two on accident as well. At this point, I begin to wonder if someone or something has been messing with the things in my apartment. 

I finish the rest of the shower with no further events. Next I have to shave. I don't have to shave every day, but I haven't shaved in a few days and I'm starting to feel the scruffiness. Shaving is usually a pretty big pain. I can't see what parts of my face haven't been shaven, so I have to rely on feeling the parts of my face which feel smooth and not hairy. I've gotten pretty good at it, but sometimes I miss spots. I reach for my shaving cream and razor to the right of the sink, but it's not there. This is getting frustrating. I feel around the top of the counter and eventually find the to the left of the sink. As I shave I can't help but wonder if I'm going insane. I don't even bother checking the usual place for my tooth brush because I know it's been moved as well. Sure enough, after feeling random places I find the toothbrush on the opposite side of where I usually place it. Perhaps I am going insane.

After brushing my teeth, I go downstairs for breakfast. I live in a two-story apartment, but the ""upstairs"" is really just the bedroom and a bathroom. On the first floor is a kitchen and dining room as well as a small living room. The person who showed me the place assured me it was very modern looking, so I assume she is correct. It feels modern, anyway. In my kitchen I go into the cupboards and find a cup for some water. When I go to fill up my cup I'm sprayed with water. That's when it hit me: today is April Fool's day. Just then my best friend, Aaron, walks through the door laughing. 

""Totally not funny. I thought I was going insane with all the things switched around!"", I said

""You should see the look on your face right now-- or should I say, you should feel the look on your face."", he replies

""Very funny.""

After a few apologies I eventually forgive him. We get to chatting a bit, and he tells me he's in town visiting his grandparents. Normally he lives in Columbus, Ohio, but it's his Grandma's birthday tomorrow. He figured he'd come in and see me (and pull a few pranks on me) before he visited her. I'm not too mad about the pranks, honestly. I'm actually happy he came to see me. It's been a bit lonely since I moved into my new place. It's nice to see a familiar face. Just then, a loud boom interrupts my thought. My friend goes to look out the window of my apartment. I ask him what happened, but he doesn't say anything. He's speechless. I hear rumbling getting closer and closer, and begin to feel fear unlike anything I've ever felt before in my life. It's impossible to describe. It's like a feeling you get only once in a lifetime, the feeling that what you're feeling now is the last thing you will ever feel. ",crugerman
[WP] Write about the end of the world from the perspective of a blind person.,Vertiburrd,"I love this, the description and the wording was well done.

One thing, though:
&gt;I hear the sounds of what must be asteroids striking the surface of the Earth.

How would a blind man just assume that asteroids are hitting the Earth? How would he know what asteroids hitting the Earth sounded like? What you should have done was just be vague with it and mention more of the sounds and feeling of what it would be like. Something like, ""I felt the ground shake with a force I had never experienced before. It felt much more than an earthquake"".

However, I found your story to be a good short read. Keep it up!

[WP] Write about the end of the world from the perspective of a blind person.,Vertiburrd,"I can hear the screams of terrified people and the sounds of crackling fire.

I hear the sounds of what must be asteroids striking the surface of the Earth.

I hear a low rumble followed by a tremendous crash. The building next to me must have collapsed.

I hear the sirens of the fire engines as the fire fighters desperately attempt to control the destruction.

I hear paramedics trying to comfort the wounded, assuring them that everything will be okay. But I'm sure they know better.

I hear a car horn feet from me, followed by squealing tires. I must have been inches away from being hit.

I remain rooted where I stand, not daring to move. I can't see, but I can smell, hear, almost taste the chaos around me. I dare not even twitch.

I know that if I move, I will be placing myself in the path of danger-danger which I cannot see and would have no chance of avoiding.

I smell smoke. It's heavy and threatens to choke the very life out of me.

I smell natural gas. The lines must have begun to leak as the building next to me collapsed. I know I have to get out of the way before there's another explosion.

I smell blood. A sharp, metallic, unpleasant smell. I pull my shirt over my nose, trying to stave the smell of death.

I hold my hand out and begin to walk.

My fingertips meet rubble. I walk slowly, deliberately, running my hand across the edge of the debris to guide me.

The debris begins to feel warmer, warmer, warmer, until it is almost unbearably hot. 

I feel someone grab my shirt collar and yank me backwards, away from the rubble.

""Are you crazy?! You almost walked into a gas fire!"" I hear someone yell.

""I'm blind,"" I say quietly. ""I can't see.""

I feel the release of pressure from my collar-whoever grabbed me had let go. 

I then feel a calloused hand grab my wrist.

""Well, come on then! I'll get you out of here!""

The voice belongs to an adult male. The underlying calmness in his voice leads me to believe he is one of the first responders, or a police officer. I can smell the aftershave underneath the smell of smoke.

He begins to pull me away from the debris. I allow myself to follow him, trusting that he will not lead me to certain death.

Behind me, I hear another explosion. ",turtlessayrawr

There wasn’t much doubt that anything would happen in my mind as I climbed up on to Mark’s rickety, hand-made platform. 

“Hey man, is this supposed to look like that Cerebro shit from X-men?” I called down, shaking the wires that were attached to my face out of my eyes.

“Ha-ha, very funny. Now focus, Chad. If everything goes right, you’ll end up in an alternate universe.” He said, pushing what seemed like a million buttons all at once.

“Yeah, okay man. Whatever you say.” I said, leaning against the handrail.

“Hold on!” he warned. “Starting in 5. 4. 3.”

There was a flash of light and then darkness.

    

.



The chirping of birds woke me. I stretched, extending my arms, feeling relieved when I heard them pop. I moved them back down to my sides, but flinched when they knocked into something on the way. My eyes flew open and I gasped when I saw there was someone next to me. Long dark hair flowed down her back. She was curled in a loose foetal position, hands tucked up against her. I could see a silver band across her ring finger, and a quick check saw its partner on my own. Her full lips moved absently as if she were talking to someone in a dream. 

She was an absolute fucking babe.

I silently cheered that Mark’s invention had actually worked for once, and better yet, had landed me in a dream world. This was heaven. The literal birds were chirping and I was getting laid by a ten out of ten goddess.

Then hell erupted. 

The door burst open, and two dark-haired menaces flew into the room. One was crying, red-faced with snot everywhere. A diaper sat on his head and I could see shit smeared into his scalp. Another had a triumphant grin slapped across his face, eyes flickering with evil. Last but not least toddled in a baby, a tuft of matching dark hair plopped on its head. She was missing a diaper, but there was the tell-tale stain of faecal matter wiped across her bare behind. 

The woman on the bed next to twisted in her sleep, mumbling “It’s your turn to deal with them.”

The screaming of the shit-head grew louder while the other one began chanting ‘Poop-head, poop-head!’ The baby sat back, opened her mouth, and started wailing. Just to add to the noise. The dream was shattered. A cold sweat broke out across my body.

There was a flash of light and suddenly I was on the floor, fingers bare and desperately clutching the hand rail.

“Dude… you all right? You’re sweating all over.”

I let out shaky laugh. “Never let me go in there again.”

“What did you see?” he asked, shocked and curious.

“Something I’m glad I can never have,” I answered honestly, the smell of shit still singeing my nose.

[WP] You stumble into a mysterious bar that sells emotions on tap instead of beer.,greentea90,"A thick haze of smoke clung to the low ceiling, muting the spherical green lamps. Their soft glow gave the windowless pub an air of mystery, punctuated by the low murmuring of the clients sparsely scattered on its floor. The tables they sat at were small and round, with simple stools at their side. A large square bar dominated the center of the room. Dozens of glowing vials of all sorts of sizes and shaped formed an impressive battalion behind the bar. ""Welcome to the Whirlpool,"" my companion sighed, starting off towards the bar. His voice was as usual, disappointed. For once, I didn't reply, contending myself with following him.

We reached the bar just in time to see the girl behind it finish giving a brown drink to a hesitant middle-aged woman before starting towards us. ""Master Terrence!"" she called out, flashing her white teeth with a smile, ""Your third visit this year, and it's only February! Will you be having the usual?""

""I'm not drinking today,"" he gruffly replied, ""have to speak with an old friends.""

""The usual, then! What about your young friend here, will he be having anything?""

Terrence snorted as he looked back at me. ""My young friend will be sitting quiet as a mouse and won't have anything. That right, boy?""

""I... I thought you were letting me go with you this time?""

""Changed my mind. Sorry kid. Just sit here and don't drink anything. Got it?""

The snarl that leapt out of my throat managed to turn itself into a polite ""Got it"" as I sat down onto a stool with far more force than necessary. He sniffed, but started off towards a small door in the back without another word. ""What a dick,"" the bartender sighed.

I looked at her with surprise. ""That's kinda unprofessional, isn't it?""

""Well, he is. Comes in here all the time and doesn't order a damn thing. Just bribes a mob boss or two in their private rooms so he can track down whatever client he's hunting. They're living like kings here at our expense but ol' Terrence doesn't care as long as he gets his money. How did a kid like you get stuck with him?""

""Kid? You can't be more than a year older than me.""

She raised her eyebrows, then laughed good-heartedly. ""True enough. But you seem smart. You can do better than this. So tell me, what are you after?""

""I hired him. I would tell you about it, but...""

""Let me guess. It's too dangerous. I don't want you to get hurt. You're not ready."" 

""Well, no, not like that-""

""Not like that because you've heard it a dozen times and it makes you want to rip someone's head off. Look - what's your name?""

""...James."" 

""Pleased to meet you. I'm Quinn. Look, I can take care of myself. Bartending can be dangerous. Yet people still treat me like I'm twelve. No one respects my opinion or values my contribution here. If I could leave, I gladly would.""

Her eyes were hard as steel and her voice was calm, but her right hand nervously wrung a small cloth. ""I... Terrence treats me the same way. 'Dumb kid' this, 'spoiled brat' that. Just because I didn't grow up on the streets doesn't mean I don't know anything."" She nodded thoughtfully, leaning forward slightly. I wavered for a moment.

""OK, Quinn, this actually is dangerous. Not just for you, but for me... and Terrence.""

""Don't worry,"" she instantly said, ""I won't tell anyone. Not a soul. You can trust me.""

""Well... My little brother and I lived together, in a small but fairly wealthy home: our parents left us a lot of money when they died. I spent my time working at a library and studying to be a railroad mechanic and he went to school. It was a good life: I was thinking of living on the road once we both completed our training, seeing all the Wonders of the world. But about three weeks ago, the elven slaver Ravid kidnapped a whole class of kids, my brother included. I couldn't just sit there and do nothing, and the authorities were taking forever, so I took most of our inheritance and hired Terrence. And I made him take me with him, and we've been tracking Ravid ever since.""

She leaned back, clearing her throat. For a moment, a tear glistened in her eye. ""Damn, James, that's rough. Terrence *is* a damn good bounty hunter. You'll find your brother.""

""I... thank you. I hadn't... I hadn't really told anyone else about it,"" I replied, slightly teary myself. Quinn looked at me for a moment, as if making a decision. ""Tell you what. I like you, James. You deserve better than running around from bar to pub to wherever the hell else, choking on Terrence's dust the whole time. Let me get you a discounted drink. It won't be the liquid gold the mob bosses have, but it'll be pretty good.""

I looked at her for a moment. Hadn't Terrence said not to drink anything? But then again, Quinn said he never bought anything here. And he probably thought I couldn't handle alcohol. ""You know what, why not. He's paying with my money anyway, right? My money, my decision.""

She laughed and began rummaging under the counter, ignoring the gleaming bottles behind her. ""Let's see... this one? No, not good enough... maybe... ah, this one!"" With a dramatic flourish she pulled out a pink bottle and grinned as she presented it to me. ""Trust me - this stuff is so good! Here, try it. I gotta go check on some of the other clients, I'll be right back.""

She walked away to the other end of the bar, I examined the bottle, shrugged, uncorked it, and took a careful sip. I gasped as I eagerly began drinking more: it was an exhilarating mix of sweetness and heat that sent massive rushes of adrenaline through my entire body. When I finally set the bottle down, it was over half empty.

For a moment, my vision glazed over, but slowly the world swam back into focus: my eyes had chosen to rest on Quinn's butt. Blushing, I looked away, but my gaze snapped back. I hadn't really noticed what she was wearing. Her light blue pants clung to her fit legs. She was leaning over the counter, talking to someone else. Someone unimportant. My heart began to beat faster. My mouth opened slowly. Quinn turned around suddenly. The client had left. My gaze traveled up her body. She was wearing a tight, clean white shirt with short sleeves. Her breasts... They were the perfect size... I stared at her, marveling that I hadn't noticed how beautiful she was. 

I felt a soft finger on my chin and my head was dragged up. ""James! Did you like it?"" Her voice - an angel's! And... her face! Her beautiful green eyes, her pearly white teeth, her dimples, her short black hair! ""James?""

For a moment, the right words couldn't come to my mouth. ""I love you! I love you so much!"" She laughed again, raising her eyebrows. ""You are so perfect! Please I - I... I want to... let me buy you a drink!"" Lovers did that. I knew that.

Quinn giggled, then tilted her head and said, ""You can buy a drink, but you have to drink it.""

""Yes absolutely! Ummmm let me think which one should I get there are so many I love you I love you I love-""

""How about this one?"" she said, her delicate hands holding an orange bottle. ""Perfect!"" I yelled, grabbing it and instantly chugging it. It was sharp and spicy, an odd mixture of solid and liquid, bunching up at first then rushing down my throat, causing me to choke and splutter it all over Quinn's shirt. She gasped, stepping back, hands flinching upwards in shock.

I felt my cheeks glowing crimson red as I exclaimed, ""Oh no! I am so sorry oh my god please Quinn I ruined everything!"" She looked at me, frozen in anger. Finally she lowered one hand, resting the other on her hip as she scowled at me. For a moment, we stared at each other, then I rushed forward with a wail.

""Oh my god Quinn I am so sorry I am such a pig I was slobbering on you oh my god I am so disgusting you were so nice to me and I treated you like a whore oh my god I am so sorry!"" I leaned on the counter, shaking, gasping for breath, tears trickling down my face that burned with the heat of unimaginable shame. How could I be so awful?!

""Please, Quinn, let me make it up for you! Let me buy you a drink and you can keep all the money!"" I desperately searched the price tags, looking for the biggest one, hoping against hope it would make her happy... ""That one!"" I exclaimed, pointing to a large blue bottle. She sighed and reluctantly gave it to me. I gulped it down... and slumped down in my seat.

I was such an idiot. I had made a good friend, then ruined it. And now her arms were crossed. I failed again. I was useless. How could I possibly think I could save my brother? I didn't know how to do anything. Ravid would kill me without blinking. I should just stay here and drink. Drink until the end of my days, drink until I-

""Terrence!"" Quinn suddenly exclaimed. I resignedly looked up. Sure enough, there he was. ""You're done early today!""

""Looks like I'm still too late,"" he snarled, grabbing me by my shirt. ""Did I not tell you just one thing, boy?! I told you not to drink!""

""You... you're right. I failed you too. I'm failure. I'm useless. Leave me here. I'm only dragging you down.""

He set me back down, turning on Quinn. ""Give him a normalizer. Now."" Smirking, she pulled out a small clear vial and helped me drink it, lifting my head from my arms. I gulped down the tasteless liquid, then sat up, shocked. Terrence grabbed my left arm and spun me back towards him. 

""How the hell do you expect to take on one of the most dangerous slavers in the world if you let some bartender run rings around you?!"" he yelled.

I gulped, then looked towards her, surprised. Run rings around me? Quinn smiled, then said, ""He's a good kid. Heart's in the right place. Good taste in women."" My cheeks burned - naturally this time - as she winked at me. But suddenly I felt a rush of anger. ""You... you tricked me!""

""Of course I did. It's business, James. I do pity your brother. Ravid's an awful creature. But I'm worried a lot more about how much I make than about your problems. Which reminds me..."" As Terrence furiously whipped his wallet out, I stepped back, tears rushing to my eyes.",ChessClue
[WP] You stumble into a mysterious bar that sells emotions on tap instead of beer.,greentea90,"Meiko didn't drink. She was just obsessed with those bar top video games - the matching game ones with half-naked ladies behind the cards. She couldn't even begin to understand why. She didn't even really like girls. Didn't generally want to see titties or anything. There was just something about THOSE particular titties. Like hiding behind cartoon playing cards made them a treasure beyond compare.

Anyway, that was her thing. And the machine at Echo's was broken, so she tried the bar next door and they didn't have one. She kept walking down Smith Street, stopping at bar after bar. It occurred to her that maybe this was an unhealthy thing to be doing, but really, it was fine, she was going to deal with it after a few hands of video titty cards.

Where Smith crossed Main the fun basically stopped. There was nothing beyond but empty office buildings and the sorts of apartments that always appear at the end of the fun blocks. There was one more bar, however, right there on the corner. Meiko hadn't seen it before, but then again, the titty machine at Echo's had never been broken before.

The crooked door opened to a set of crooked stairs that dropped aggressively downward, in uncommonly deep steps. Meiko felt like a child, holding the handrail as she slid from step to step.

The interior of the bar was cold, but clean. Polished wooden floors led to through a nearly-empty sitting room to a long, wide bar that arced almost out of sight.

No video game machine, thought Meiko. Now she was annoyed.

""Hey!"" she yelled, stomping towards the bar. The bartender was a golden wisp of a man, bespectacled and starched.

""Yes ma'am,"" he smiled. ""How can I help you?""

""How come you don't have any pervert games?"" said Meiko. ""What good is a bar without pervert games?""

The smile never faltered. ""You've got me there. What kind of a bar indeed?"" He motioned toward the nearest stool. ""Seems I've wronged you, my dear. How about something on the house?"" 

""I don't really drink,"" said Meiko. ""That's not what I do at bars.""

The bartender leaned across the bar. ""You know, I'm not sure drinking's what bars are really for, anyway. I mean, alcohol's a vehicle - not a destination. Right?""

Meiko's eyebrows went up and slightly to the left. That was all she could think to say.

The bartender ran a finger over an assortment of glass bottles. ""More about a feeling, right? People use alcohol to help get them somewhere - emotionally. Sad people want to be less sad. Happy people want to be happier. That's...there's a bit more nuance to it, obviously, but that's what it is. And I say - skip the middleman.""

""Aren't you the middleman?"" said Meiko.

""The figurative middleman. Not the actual middleman."" The bartender shook his head. ""Never mind that. Just tell me - how would you like to feel?""

""I'd like to feel like I'm playing titty cards,"" said Meiko. ""But you don't have that. So I guess I'd like to feel like I'm home eating microwave ramen and watching pirated Game of Thrones.""

The bartender tapped on the bar top. ""Those aren't feelings. Those are things you do in order to FEEL a certain way. How do they make you feel?""

Meiko considered this. ""Full.""

The bartender sighed. ""Not...""

""Like, FULL,"" said Meiko. ""All over. Not empty. Like, like it usually feels like everything is leaking out. Just everything. All the time. And it makes me so tired and empty. And titty cards just...I guess it distracts me. Is that a feeling? I feel distracted. And when I feel distracted I don't feel like garbage.""

""Ah."" The bartender reached below the bar and poured a shot. He held it out to Meiko. It was clear and odorless.

""I don't drink.""

""It's not alcohol.""

""That's what date rapists say,"" said Meiko. But still, she took the shot glass and downed the contents. ""Not alcohol."" Meiko smacked her lips. ""What do roofies taste like?""

""It's not a roofie. It's interest.""

""Interest? Interest in what?""

The bartender raised his arms. ""Life.""

Meiko gently set the shot glass down. ""O...kay.""

""Want another?""

""Interest? No...suppose I'm good there.""

The bartender poured another shot. ""This is a good one.""

Meiko was slightly surprised to find herself draining the shot without any hesitation. ""Yeah? What was it?""

""Pride.""

""I already had pride, dickface."" But Meiko laughed as she said this, sliding the glass across the counter. ""One more. Then I need to go.""

""Which one do you want?""

Meiko thought. She wasn't sure why she was playing along, but there was a lightness there she couldn't remember feeling. She wanted to run. She wanted to write. She wanted to call her mother and say things she only just then remembered she felt. It was a heat. Deep. Radiant. Pulsing from the core of her being. It was electric. 

She didn't know why she was playing along, but she never wanted to stop.

""Do you have shame?"" she asked.

""Yeah?"" said the bartender. ""That's what you want?""

""If you have it,"" said Meiko.

""Of course we do,"" said the bartender. ""Some people, it's all they ever drink."" He poured the shot. 

Meiko took the glass. ""I only need the one. To remember."" She drank.

""We all need to remember sometimes,"" said the bartender. ""Come back anytime.""

Meiko nodded, slipping off the stool. ""Maybe."" Then she left, walking back up Smith Street. The bars sang a song as she passed. A traveling song. A wish for safe passage to wherever the night may take you. ",WinsomeJesse
[WP] You stumble into a mysterious bar that sells emotions on tap instead of beer.,greentea90,"I walked down the dim-lit stairs, the sharp clap of my work shoes echoing in a cracked cement corridor. I would sometimes stop off at Micky's pub on thew way home, but tonight something else caught my eye; a neon sign across the street that I had never noticed before that simply read ""Elation.""

The bartender was a thick man, but not fat. He wore a white button-up shirt rolled past his elbow, and a black vest to match. He was beginning to bald, his brown hair thinning near the top. He stood, somber looking, cleaning a glass with a white rag. The bar had a half dozen booths or so, and people sat under different colored lights, each booth cast in a different glow. I sat at the bar, rapping my knuckles twice as the bartender looked up at me. I gave him a smile as he set the glass down, leaning on the bar with both arms.

""And what will you be having tonight, Jim?"" He asked in a voice that was higher pitched than his size would suggest. How did he know my name?
""Uh, I'll just have a scotch, neat. I never noticed this place before. Are you new?"" 
The thick man chuckled. ""New? No son, we're not new. Maybe you just didn't look hard enough before. Also, sorry to tell you but we don't have scotch.""
""That's fine."" I said, shrugging. ""Just give me anything you have on tap. Domestic would be preferable.""
The stout man looked at me like he would a child. ""I think you misunderstand me. We don't serve alcohol here, but I do have something that can help you forget, if that's what you need.""

I frowned. ""No alcohol?"" I asked, my confusion obvious. ""What kind of bar doesn't have alcohol?"" I looked up at the chalkboard above the bar. The drinks had strange names. Regret, anger, sorrow, happiness, apathy. Each drink seemed to be named after an emotion. It figured that they would have to name them like that. A bar didn't go far in this town unless they had a way to catch peoples  attention. ""Pick for me then. Dealers choice."" I said. 

The man smiled, then began mixing a drink. I didn't recognize the bottles he poured from; they must have been imported or small batch distilleries. He poured the drink into a martini glass. The drink had a deep green hue, mist rising from the top of the glass. ""And what's this?"" I asked, lifting it to my nose. It had a lemon scent, with something sweet I couldn't put my finger on. ""Wonder."" he stated simply. He didn't say more, so I shrugged, lifting the glass and taking a drink. 

The room burst with color. How had I never found this place before? The lights from the sign swirled in the air. How did light work like that, and how did you add the color? I felt the smooth bar beneath my hand. How did they get such a big piece of wood so far from the forest, and how did they get it so smooth? I felt small, wondering why I was here, why I was alive. How could so many ideas and possibilities...

The feeling faded. A dim green light dimmed above my head as it cleared. I pushed the drink forward, jerking my stool back to stand. ""What did you put in my drink?"" I shouted. ""Are you trying to drug me?"" 

The large man chuckled. ""Exactly what I said it was, son. Wonder. Care to try another?"" He asked, motioning to the board. I looked, more curious than angry now. The effect hadn't lasted long, so why not try another? ""I'll take a sorrow,"" I replied, ""but only a small shot."" The large man nodded, then began mixing again. When he finished he poured a dark blue liquid into a thimble size glass, not more than a few drops. It was thick like honey. ""You don't want too much of this one, trust me."" I shrugged again, then drank the thick liquid.

My eyes instantly felt heavy. I was close to 40, single, and far from where I wanted to be in my career. I lived alone, and had no family. What was the point of it all if this was all that life had to offer? Tears began to stream from my eyes as I thought of all I didn't have, all of the things I would never accomplish. I was a complete failure at life. I couldn't do anything right, and...

I came down from the emotion. A dark blue light dimmed above my head, and I sucked in a deep breath. These were not the names of drinks on the board, they were actual emotions! The large man gave me a smile, knowing that I finally understood. ""One more, for the road?"" He asked. I couldn't pass it up. I didn't know what was happening, but I needed another; I needed it more than anything. ""I want anger,"" I said briskly, ""a lot of it. The next thing I knew there was a large glass of blood-red liquid in front of me. I drank it all in three swallows. 

""I could feel the heat raise up inside me. The world was doomed. We lived in a cynical, selfish, destructive time. I hated my boss for leaving me behind for the promotion. I hated myself for not following my dream of writing a book while traveling the country. Most of all, I hated the world. I hated what it was, and what it had become. Scum filled the streets, a cancer, siphoning off the needy and kind. I had to go and...

I came to, breathing deep and hard. A red light dimmed above my head as I calmed myself. ""I think you've had enough for a day."" The large man said. ""I want to try one more."" I pleaded. He slowly shook his head. ""Not today son, not today."" 
I slumped, but stood anyway. ""How much for the, er, drinks?"" I asked. 

""No charge. you pay for them in your own way."" he said. ""Well, thanks. I'll be back."" I said with a wave. ""Oh, I'm sure you will."" he replied. I saw a drink on the list as I stood to go. ""What's nirvana like?"" I asked, raising my eyebrow. ""He chuckled again, shaking his head. ""Not on the menu yet."" I nodded, then turned to leave. I looked at the patrons at the tables, under different colored lights. They all strangely looked like me. I'm not sure why that didn't bother me.

I walked up the stairs and back into the night. 

My eyes opened. I sat on a soft cushion, legs crossed and hands cupped before me. I felt calm, at peace. My meditation had been getting better, I had a truly clear mind. Free of thought, free of emotion. I felt like what had troubled me that day had melted away. I didn't know how, but meditation had started to bring me peace, and tonight felt different than the rest of the nights. 

I slept better that night than I had in weeks.

"[WP] Not to be outdone by the best necromancer in existence, a vitamancer has carefully plotted for the birth of a thousand babies at the same moment. This is their story.",rm-minus-r,"*I left it purposefully unclear why Nick had called Victor ""Vic"" because it was a bit hard to do given I wanted to stick with Victor's POV. Here's a part 2 from Nick's POV which should tie up the loose ends, but you're free to ignore it and imagine up your own reasons*.

--

Any kind of 'mancy always has a cost.

That's the first thing all 'Mancers learnt at the 'Mancer's Institute. Aquamancers grew more dehydrated the more they used their powers. The curaremancers - i.e. the healers - they were to the ones to sacrifice a part of their vitality. 

Vitality wasn't enough to bring back the dead and create life anew, however. In order to allow such miraculous acts, something more permanent needed to be taken. Vitamancers like Vic sacrificed their mind, their sanity, as a seed taken in by the new life. Necromancers like Nick sacrificed their memory, to revive death's joy of life. 

Most 'Mancers paid a temporary cost. Dehydration, vitality - so long as you were careful, you could gain back what you lost with some work. Your mind, your memories - they were lost forever. 

But the attraction of power over life and death was too much to deter many people. Nick and Vic were no different.

Necromancers tended to work to create as many amazing memories as possible, in order to be able to retain their most important memories. Vitamancers tried to get around their cost by being incredibly conservative with their vitamancy, and being careful to always keep their  minds as sharp as possible through brain teasers and difficult academic courses.

Vic hadn't done any of that, and Nick blamed himself.

They had been best friends. They had grown up in the same town, one of the few 'Mancers their age, and had been thick as thieves. They both had other friends, of course, but none as close as the other. The other students had gotten used to them always being together. 

And Nick had screwed everything up at the fourth year competition. They had both spent months planning their entries. Nick had already decided on what memory he would sacrifice to resurrect the samurai - a memory of him and Vic, hanging out and goofing around over the course of a few days. He hoped that the idea of 'friendship' would be a sufficient trigger to revive the samurai's desire to live.

The day of the competition had come, and Nick had gotten up to the stage with his twenty sword fragments. He had thrown them across the stage before chanting the Words of Connection that would allow the samurai to feed on his memory. 

But even as he felt the first samurai come to feed in his mind, he had realized that it wouldn't be enough. Nick had begun to panic. There had been ten samurai consciousnesses feeding in his brain by then, and the memory had been 
almost completely absorbed by them. He hadn't been able to think of anything else to give him in his sheer fright. If he didn't do anything quick, he could lose entire swaths of his mind, become a near amnesiac.

So before a samurai could absorb that last piece of memory, Nick concentrated on the samurai and *pulled*. 

He had meant to pull them out of his mind.

Instead, they had disappeared into his memory.

Nick had frozen in horror. He had no idea what had just happened. He had stood there, in silent panic, for ten minutes, before he had seen the sword fragments begin to rattle on the stage. Smoke had begun to pour out of them. Finally, the smoke had condensed to form twenty men, looking completely human.

Nick had been *horrified*. That memory - that one memory hadn't been enough to resurrect them so completely. He had planned for a zombie-fied resurrection, not a full resurrection.

*What had he sacrificed?*

He had finally realized what was gone when he had turned around to whisper a congratulations to Vic, who had gotten second place. Vic had glared at him viciously and had told Nick not to talk to him.

Nick had asked around the school after the competition. No one had remembered that Vic and Nick had been friends. In fact, everyone had remembered them being rather antagonistic. Desperate, he had called up his family, Vic's family. Neither of them had remembered them being friends. Vic's family had point blank asked why Vic's eternal rival was calling them. 

In a way, he had been successful in reviving the samurai with 'friendship'. But instead of taking his memory of it - they had taken it away from him entirely, by stealing the entire school's memory of Vic and Nick's friendship.

This had been a frightening discovery, and Nick had immediately informed Necromancers Associated of his discovery. But no one had believed him. They had told him that the samurai might've planted memories in his head, as was fairly common. It was unthinkable that a necromancer could affect other people's memories as well as their own.

Now, here he lay in a hospital bed, with nine hundred ninety nine clones of him, his life destroyed by his best friend. As a baby, he couldn't really do anything except think. And so he thought. 

Vic had obviously gone mad from his vitamancy long ago. The friend he had cherished so dearly... he was no more.

So with his necromancy or not, Nick knew what he had to do. He needed to stop Vic, before he became a public menace, hated by the world. He hadn't told the mindmancers who had done this to him - he didn't want them to go after Vic without him, as selfish as it was. No, the 'Mancer community would have to wait until he was old enough to walk and talk by himself. 

Although he was at a disadvantage due to the loss of his 'mancy, there were a thousand of him now, and Nick was sure they were all thinking the same thing. They needed to stop Vic themselves, before Vic did something unthinkable - more unthinkable than this.

He owed that much to the man he had cared for so much.",theviridiansky

"[WP] Not to be outdone by the best necromancer in existence, a vitamancer has carefully plotted for the birth of a thousand babies at the same moment. This is their story.",rm-minus-r,"It had started so well.  He did everything he was supposed to.  First, take on a suitably impressive name.  He figured Dread Lord Mortus sounded like someone you wouldn't want to mess with.  In any case, it was much better than his given name.  Who would bend at the knee to a necromancer named 'Melvar'?

Next, he built a tower.  Or more accurately, he had his tireless skeleton army (more of a small squad of skeletons at that point rather than an army) build him a tower.  After that first shoddily constructed mess fell in on itself, he hired a few master masons to oversee the mindless skeleton army to build him a tower one could actually live in.  One with black stone walls and Gothic designs and hidden traps fit for a necromancer lord. 

Next, he started raiding graveyards.  Slowly his skeleton army (squad) got more and more numerous.  Much more durable ghouls and zombies were added to the mix.  

Then, they started to march.  Any town or village in their path was spared if they accepted the Dread Lord as their new regent.  Any that did not bow, got to add to the army of undead instead. 

It was all going fantastic.  Then the Dread Lord Mortus and his army ran across an old crumbling castle made of white stone.  Inside, there lived a very, very old woman.  Despite her age, she did not stoop or move with any kind of pain or arthritis.  She merely walked out in front of her castle, looked over the army, and shook her head reprovingly. 

""Go home, necromancer.  This is my land as it has been since this castle was whole.  I claim the towns and people beyond this point.  Their happiness warms my heart.  So if you turn your army around, there will be no reprisals.""

'The sheer arrogance?' Melvar, now the most powerful necromancer in the land thought to himself, 'Who was she to order HIM around!?'

With one command, the undead army took a step forward towards the crumbling castle.  The old woman made a well-practiced arcane gesture, and suddenly the undead army... wasn't.

What were once rotting bones and ragged corpses were now confused people looking around.  Young and old alike suddenly recognized long dead relatives and rushed to hug them and celebrate their new lease on life.  Most, however, started to look for more fitting attire than the barely decent rags they now had on. 

The Dread Lord Mortus screamed in rage.  Eldritch energies arced out from his hands and all the people stiffened.  Their flesh started pouring off their bones until only rag-clad skeletons remained.   The army lined up once again, only for the old woman to sigh and make her gesture once more. 

This time, the whole and healthy people screamed in fright at the memories of what had happened to them and started to flee in every direction like startled rabbits.  Some of the braver men and women rushed up to the Dread Lord with whatever makeshift weapons they could find.  

Melvar fired bolt after bolt of necrontic energy at his assailants.  He never saw the skull-crushing tree branch in the hands of a former village smith who had snuck up behind him.  

The next sight Melvar saw was the wrinkled but kind face of the old women, a vitamancer he reasoned.  One of the rarest of magic users in the world.  

""How are you feeling?"" she asked with a surprisingly strong voice.  

Melvar gave it some though.  Then, he realized that he felt... wonderful.  He hadn't felt this fantastic in a long time, ""I fell great.  What did you do to me?""

""To you?"" the old woman smirked, ""Not much.  Only brought your fool body back to life.  Usually when I do that, all the hate and anger seems to remain dead and buried.""

It was true.  Melvar tried to remember how angry he had felt at everyone who had ridiculed him and put him down when he was growing up; his fellow mages, his family; the woman he thought was his first love.  Instead of the familiar fire of rage, there was just calm serenity.

The old woman spoke, ""This next part may upset you, necromancer.""

""What?  Make me more upset than you undoing a lifetime's worth of work, scattering my army, and crushing my hope to rule this land?""

The old woman nodded, ""That all happened a hundred years ago.""

Melvar stared open-eyed at the realization, ""Then my legacy?""

""All but forgotten.  Some of the rarer books may mention the Dread Lord Mortus in passing along with speculation of what could have happened to him in the end.""

""I...  I see,"" Melvar sighed, ""So it was all for nothing?  What do the books think happened to me?""

""Most of them speculate that a party of adventurers defeated you in a climactic battle that made the heavens, themselves, tremble.""

""And the rest of the books?""

""Those claim you found true love and turned away from conquest and necromancy.""

Melvar stared at the woman, barely comprehending the words she had uttered.

The old woman blushed, ""Those books are generally not meant to be read by youth.  My favorite one told that your new bride kidnapped by a rival and that you were forced to revert back to your past as a Necromancer Lord to defeat him.  You ended up saving your love's life moments before it was too late.  What happens in the remaining chapter, I won't quote to anyone less than three hundred years of age.""

Melvar opened his mouth in astonishment, and then closed it again.  Then he opened it again, ""So..  what happens now?""

The old woman grinned, her mouth still full of white teeth, ""I can always join your quest to rescue your love from the horrible clutches of your rival.""

The necromancer sighed, ""My 'love' only pretended to love me on a dare from a fellow student only to expose the truth a week later in the middle of class.""

""That's horrible.  Sounds like you need a better person to love?""

""Who would love a necromancer?""

""Perhaps someone who is not the least bit afraid of his power?""

""Like... yourself?""

The old woman looked at herself, ""Why not?  Oh, you mean my apparent age?  I understand men look for younger looking women, and I know the reasons why.  But then again, I'm a vitamancer after all.  Life is my bailiwick.""

She started to glow.  When the light faded, there stood the woman, but looking far younger.  Her eyes, full of silent laughter, and her long white hair were the only things that remained unchanged, but now her hair curtained a smooth, unwrinkled heart-shaped face.  Her body filled out and grew a few inches until it was more appropriate for a goddess than a mortal.

Melvar's breath caught for a moment before he asked, ""Why?""

""Why?"" the young woman laughed, ""Because who would take a magic user who looked like this seriously?  A dancer? Yes.  A courtesan?  Yes. But a magic user?  Hah!""

Melvar nodded.  He certainly had detractors that scoffed at his age despite all of his potential when he was younger, ""I don't know if I can fall in love.  And I can't promise that it would be with you, even if I did.""

The young woman laughed, ""Of course, i know that, silly.  That's why I'm going on an adventure with you.""

""What?"" Melvar stated blankly.

""I know I still have my old staff and bow somewhere in the storeroom here,"" the woman seemed lost in thought for a moment, ""An adventure!  It's one of the best ways to get to know someone.  Oh, I didn't even tell you my name.  I'm Nalina.  Former court mage of castle Whitestone, most powerful vitamancer, enjoyer of lighthearted books and other things we can find out later on our adventure?  What say you, Dread Lord Mortus?""

""It's Melvar, actually.  A pleasure to meet you, lady Nalina. My thanks for bringing me back to life... after a hundred years so everything I know is long gone.""

""You're welcome!"" Nalina chirped.

Melvar sighed.  Try as he may, the familiar cushion of anger and rage didn't materialize.  He stood up and cracked his back, ""Very well, let's go on this adventure-date!""

""Yes, let's go make a thousand babies!""

""What?!"" Melvar's head whipped around towards the young mage.

""I said, let's go on this adventure!"" Nalina laughed and started walking.  The former necromancer lord followed cautiously behind her.",mistaque

""We've been looking for you, Felix,"" the man approached me. 
Confused is not too strong a word to explain why this balding man in a black suit approached the table. He blew out the candles on the table and took a seat. 

""You're the chosen one,"" he whispered to me.
I looked to my date, the gorgeous Lauren Durant who I had only just convinced to go out with me, and I gave her a startled shrug so that she did not think I actually knew this man.

""How do you know my name?"" I inched my chair further from him.

""We have been watching you. I know you're retired, but we need your killing skills if we are going to stop Ehrenstrom."" The man's voice was gruff and stract. 

The restaurant violinist approached the table ready to play the song I had arranged earlier, Abba's Dancing Queen. It was our song. I met eyes with Lauren, and even in the dim light of the restaurant the blue cut my sole to pieces. 

""I - ehm - think you have the wrong person, sir.""

""No, tis you Felix. The chosen one. I know you don't play by the rules, but god dammit you're the best killer I've ever laid these old eyes on!""

The other couples in the restaurant began to stare. The violinist now attempted the opening piano slide of ""Dancing Queen"" but I waved him off, mouthing ""not now"". 

""Look, I did some karate as a kid, but I never killed anybody. I think you should go.""

The man clutched my forearm and I saw my reflection in his sunglasses.

""You're making the biggest mistake of your life, kid!"" his jaw clenched as he muttered.

""I think we should call the police,"" Lauren reached for her purse.

The suited man stood and roundhoused the purse out of her slender hands. His foot made a very unnatural swooshing sound as it cut through the air.

""There's no time Felix!"" he screamed to the restaurant, ""come! Hurry!"" he motioned for me to follow as he sprinted for the door. ""This baby is about to blow any second!""

The waiters and guests of Cafe Rouge stood in a panic and ran for the doors.
I grabbed Lauren's hand, and we stood for a moment looking into each other's eyes. 

""Run you fool!"" an old man who I had not noticed before rushed us out of the building. 
I saw the suited man standing in the street outside of the cafe. 

""Come this way if you want to live.""

""God dammit"" I muttered. 

I saw the explosion of the cafe in the reflection of his sunglasses and time, for reasons I could never understand, moved slower. 

""You made the right choice, kid.""
The man disappeared and I never heard from him again.",squiddie96

"[WP] A story of one specific genre, but with all of the tropes and stereotypes of different genres.",taabigamer,"The wind came hot over the mountains that night. A Santa Ana, sent like a the devil blowing a little kiss straight into my little town. Kind of heat that makes anything happen. Where disagreements are just the prologues to fistfights Cards are played one handed, cause everyone has the other on their gun.  

Kind of night anything can happen. You can even get a full glass of whiskey at Al's saloon.


The rain had just begun to piss down hard, but I knew it wouldn't be enough to cool off a night like this. The wind slammed the saloon doors open and revolvers were in a dozen hands. My drink was in mine. I sipped it and wondered how much longer I could stretch it before I had to buy another.

I wasn't there for the drinks. If I'd wanted a whiskey like Al served I could fill a jug with water and add just enough booze to turn it brown in the comfort of my own home. I was there for the same reason we all were.

Caroline.


She and Rusty were just hitting the middle of Dixie. Rusty was as entranced by her as the rest of us, and was missing about every third note. But no one cared. Rusty tickling the ivory was just the frame. Caroline was the work of art.

She stood on the stage, the one well lit part of the whole damn saloon. Gas lamps on either side of her casting twin shadows across her feet, both swaying in time with her hips. I'd spent the night with my own shadow keeping me company, and right then I'd have traded anything to spend the night with hers instead. I closed my eyes and mouthed the words alongside her.


There's buckwheat cakes, and Injun batter,

Makes you fat or a little fatter.

Look away. Look away. Look away. Dixie Land.


She stretched the words playing with them. Lazily wandering off her lips like alley cats. A hand touched my arm, and my hand was on my gun. 


She sat across eyes wandering over me, like she was doing figures that weren't adding up right. She had soft features the same way a viper did. Smooth, elegant and deadly. I woulda bet a couple of dollars mine wasn't the only gun under the table right now. The clothes were too good for the territories. Not a hint of a wrinkle around the eyes or the mouth. This wasn't a dame who'd ever smiled enough to leave a mark. 

I never took much to schooling but even I could see the doll spelled trouble. I couldn't of been happier.


""What's girl like you doing in a joint, hell a town like this?""

""Because the man I need to find didn't have the courtesy to live somewhere descent,"" a smile flicked across her eyes that didn't dare crease that flawless skin. I turned to face the face bar and downed my drink.

""And what sorta man were you looking for exactly.""

""A sheriff.""

""Well your about 8 months too late,"" I pulled the tarnished star from my pocket, ""this is just a jagged little knick knack now. I'm just waiting for Al to feel sorry enough for me to trade a drink for it.""

""Perfect.""

""Why's that?""

""I you were a sheriff still, I'd have to have asked you to take time out of your busy schedule to help little old me, but now I won't.""

""How ya figure.""

""Because you've been nursing that drink for an hour, you're shirt has more holes than buttons and you haven't offered to buy me a drink. All that adds to a broke ex sheriff, and whatever you did to get yourself fired means no one around here will hire you.""

I leaned back in my chair and did my best to keep my face neutral. I didn't take kindly to anyone laying me out in front of myself.

""So,"" she continued, ""you can start immediately.""

I laughed. ""What exactly is it that you think I'll being doing for you, if I decide I want your money.""

""Oh I know you'll be working for me. Because one, I have plenty of something you need, money. And more importantly I know your reputation.""

""Then you don't know much, my reputation is equal parts lies from wronged women, and lies I've told to women I hope to get a chance to wrong.""

""Well I hope the part about your addiction to strange sorts of cases wasn't either category.""

I smiled, admittedly it wasn't. ""Go on.""

""Well you see,"" she pulled out a wanted poster of a pretty women, she layed it in front of me. I read it aloud as I skimmed.

""Jocelyn Weathers, Wanted for the murder of Sarah LeStraud, Dead, 5000 Dollars,"" I looked up ""apart from the hefty price tag I don't see anything that out of the ordinary here darling.""

She smiled, ""well the thing is, Jocelyn Weathers is my sister, and I'm Sarah LeStraud.""

...
A gentle breeze blew as the sun set over the ocean, turning the sky a warm shade of orange. Seagulls cried overhead and the waves rolled onto the sandy beach, breaking into a white froth and pulling back into the water.

Miranda sipped her smoothie. Though it was almost night, it was still sweltering and the cool, refreshing taste of strawberry was welcome. Miranda sighed contentedly. It had been a wonderful date with Fred and now they were watching the sun set. ""How romantic."" said Fred, mirroring her thoughts.

The sky turned the color of a bruise. They sat in silence for a minute, listening to the waves. Miranda spoke.

""My dad died when I was a child. He was so sweet and caring. I remember him pushing me on the swing on the weekends and taking me to the doctor when I was sick."" She smiled and stirred her drink with her straw.

Fred slightly turned his head to look at her eyes. Her beautiful blue eyes, blue as the sky, blue as a calm lake, blue as the shirt he was wearing, blue as the can of Pepsi someone had left of the beach hours before. She was the perfect woman and their relationship was perfect and nothing could ever, ever happen to their love.

"[WP] A story of one specific genre, but with all of the tropes and stereotypes of different genres.",taabigamer,"""Roland"" I said staring deeply into his eyes, my voice echoing with sincerity, ""You are all that a woman might ever desire, the greatest gift to have ever graced my life"" He truly was, for all that the man had the most terrible fashion sense with his long white beard and pointy little star speckled hat. 

""That is good Lucille, but I have three more gifts for you"" Roland answered as he took a step backwards. 

""Presents?"" I asked, delighted as one could only expect. I knew after all how much he loved me.

Roland bent down on one knee and I felt my breath catching in my throat, but a moment later he began to unwrap a bundle I only now noticed at his feet. ""A bow made by the finest bowyer in all the land, it is said that it might never miss the mark"" 

I stared for a moment in confusion and after a moment illumination dawned, ""Oh darling! You wish me to be safe. I know it would trouble your heart so to lose me and not to have me near.""

From the bundle he next extracted a whistle that looked to be made of some sort of bone, ""With this you might summon the hippogryph to carry you far from here and unto the dark tower upon the shipwrecked sands.""

He was really quite vexing when he would play these little games, but still after a moment meaning again made itself clear. ""Oh that is a bed and breakfast! You want us to go away together for a weekend. It sounds lovely! A beach somewhere?""

Roland nodded solemnly, ""Indeed. It is on the other side of the sea of storms past the great maelstrom which is guarded by the legions of the damned. Though I know it seems hopeless.."" 

I cut him off there, ""Right! I'll need something to wear then. Bikini weather""
Roland again gave one of those solemn nods and revealed the last contents of the bundle, an incredibly tiny bikini made of out some rather agonizingly twisted bits of metal. ""The ancient armor of Sryssthala, magically enchanted in the fires of Mount Deltos and protection against all but the most mighty of blows.""

I simply stared for a moment and then forced a smile. Well, he wasn't loved for his fashion sense and the trip was still a lovely gesture. We'd not yet gone away together and I found that I could hardly wait to find what the weekend would have in store!

"[WP] A story of one specific genre, but with all of the tropes and stereotypes of different genres.",taabigamer,"All it took was the draw of a gun to silence the saloon. Nervous glances between cowboys, law men and towns folk were all they could do, helpless as they were caught in the middle of this encounter. The barrel of Bolton's colt was pointed at none other than the toughest outlaw of Santa Fe, who's back didn't even twitch.     

""Do you notice me *now*, senpai?"" Bolton asked.  

The outlaw cleared his throat, and downed the rest of his drink. ""Barkeep,"" he said. ""Another whiskey.""  

Bolton flicked the safety off his colt. ""We're going to be late to school senpai. It's too early in the day to start drinking.""   

A glass of whiskey clacked on the bar table to the outlaw's right. His hand reached over for it. A loud bang filled the saloon. Glass shattered, raining shards and whiskey on the whimpering barkeep crouched under the counter.  

""Well now,"" the outlaw said. ""Someone owes me a whiskey.""  

""Senpai! Either you leave this saloon with me for class, or I'm doing to you what Vicious did to Spike at the end of *Cowboy Bebop*.""  

The long back of the outlaw straightened, and twisted. He faced the man who's gun continued to point at him. ""Bolton-chan,"" he growled. ""You would need a katana for that.""  

""Don't make a fool of me senpai! It's embarrassing.""  

""Not as embarrassing as carrying a gun with only one bullet.""  

Bolton lowered his gun to check the chamber. The outlaw did not hesitate. He flung himself from the bar stool and rolled across the saloon like tumbleweed on the prairie. Before Bolton could react, a hand grasped the gun's barrel, and yanked it away.  

""Senpai noticed me,"" was all Bolton could say. More for himself than the outlaw who towered over him. The saloon breathed a sigh of relief as one. ""But now we're both going to be late for school.""  

""Bolton-chan,"" the outlaw growled. ""It's Saturday.""  

He flushed. ""How embarassing! But with senpai so close to me, I can feel my heart-beating really fast. I almost don't mind getting tricked this morning. That was so cool! There's so much for me to learn if I'm going to be as cool an outlaw as---""  

""You said something?""  

""N-Nothing senpai. How about I get you another whiskey?""  

""Nah,"" the outlaw growled. ""I'm waiting on someone.""  

Bolton blinked. ""Who would senpai be meeting with this early on a Saturday?""  

The tall back turned around as he made his way back to the bar stool. ""Sam-san.""  

""Wait, Sam-san from Class-4E?!""  

""Yeah. He and I have a score to settle.""  

The saloon bustled with life again as the townsfolk left, hearing that there would be a showdown between the outlaw and the notorious Sam, who was wanted in every county of New Mexico.  

""Why senpai?! What happened?!""  

The outlaw reached over for a bottle across the counter, and poured himself another glass. He downed it in one gulp. ""Caught him talking trash about my Gun Duels Club. Said his Quick Draw Club was better."" The outlaw snorted. ""Like I'm going to let that slide.""  

Bolton gasped. ""A duel between the presidents of the Gun Duels and Quick Draw Club? That's amazing! Can't believe I'm going to witness such a battle between two skilled gunfighters in my first year at Bandit High School! There's going to be so much to learn about---""  

""Stop narrating Bolton-chan,"" the outlaw growled. ""That's annoying.""  

Bolton blushed. ""Sorry senpai.""  

""Go sit somewhere quiet like, so I can enjoy my drink in peace.""  

""O-Of course!"" Bolton didn't mind that the toughest outlaw in Santa Fe was sending him away, and didn't even mind that the outlaw called him annoying. In fact, as his boots struck the wood of the saloon floor towards a corner table, Bolton was a little happy.

Senpai finally noticed him.

Kelly blushed, gasping for breath. She didn't have the words to reply. 

""Oh darling, I love everything about you."" Ned continued, running one hand through her flaxen hair.

""I can't-"" she whispered, and he let out a sigh. 

""No need to tell me, darling, I know you feel the same."" He replied, placing a gentle kiss on her cheek. She moved a hand to his chest, her heart racing. 

""I'm so excited for us to be together forever."" He said, chuckling. He tightened his arms around her, and she let out a noise of surprise. He laughed a little louder, and gazed into her eyes. ""We'll be practically inseparable!"" 

She gave one final choke and her body drooped in his arms, lifeless. He looked lovingly at her figure, hardly marred besides a bruise or two. 

He carried her gently to the bed, setting her down and slipping the straps of her dress off her shoulders. He gently kissed her neck, careful not to press too hard. He loved her milky skin, flawless and clear. He inhaled, breathing the scent of her in. If he could stay there all day, he would. 

""Oh, we'll be so close to one another."" He whispered, tucking a lock of hair gently behind her ear. He fetched his knife, perfectly sharpened for the occasion. He ran a finger gently down her face, sighing. ""So close, darling, once I'm in your skin."" ",mr_trick

"[WP] A sharpshooter and his accused-witch wife standoff against the town authorities. Salem Village, 1692.",tomatoaway,"Slowly they plodded up the hill, which led to a large, flat field whereupon sat the Witch’s hut. Hills and mounds surrounded them, some close, some far-off. Most gloomy, shaded with trees. There were no trees around the Witch’s house.  

The reverend at the front, bedecked in his holy garb, spoke passages from Deuteronomy. He led the crowd. His voice peeled high like the cry of a bell; and the surging congregation at his back carried weapons, lengths of rope and clubs, and stared ahead in hatred and fell determination. 

Mabel Woster did not so much slumber in her bed as she did *repose*, rot while still alive. And solely because of the Witch and her dark workings—because of that crooked black thing with talons and a tarnished soul, hiding in the skin of a woman. What they were doing, their violent action, was not just for revenge, on Mabel’s part. (Though that was partly the reason.) This was for further prevention. This was for extermination, application of spiritual pesticides to rid their town of the demonic parasites squirming within. 

Like the slimy, fanged worm she was, she'd be squashed. The town would lift its boot above her and bring down its heel upon her head. Hopefully, use of such measures would garner results and those diseased arteries flowing through Salem would collapse and die. With luck, her ilk would no longer burden God’s benevolent creations. 

The revered gestured the convocation to stop about 20 meters from the front door. He walked forward and rapped on the oak frame, smiling darkly with a shut bible under his arm. 

“Yes?” It was the Witch. 

“Anne Delaney?” he asked, and gently tested the door. There was no give. 

“Do not do that again, Reverend. I’m warning you.” 

Harshly, he whispered, “Would you really practice your devilry with the eyes of God and Man upon you? Are you so foul and far-gone? I cannot believe such is true, one who has attended Mass so often and with such regularity.”

“I haven’t been to mass in months, Reverend. You won’t play me the fool.” 

“You dangerous, idiot girl,” he said, obliterating the pretense of friendly and worried authority figure. “What you have wrought… it is nearly unforgivable. But with admission of sin, your penance will come.” He quickly turned to look at the crowd, who had inched closer by a few meters. “Just invite me inside, and I will have you sign the papers. I will keep the congregation from interceding, I promise.” By deliberately pointing, the Revered gestured for the two strongest farmers in the crowd, Rodney and Jeremiah, to slowly, quietly come forward, and stand at his side. They did. And braced themselves against the door, without touching it. 

She laughed, and the Reverend flinched. Satan’s amusement was never good, practically an omen unto itself. “You expect me to place my life in the hands of a man who spins stories for a living? Get away from my house, or my husband and I will take lethal action, as is our right. I am feeling unsafe.” 

“Foul bitch, you lost any ‘rights’ when you delved into witchery.” He nodded toward the door, and stepped back.   

Jeremiah looked to Rodney. They silently agreed on which part of the door they’d individually bash in, and then began their work. 

Immediately the Witch began warning them to stop. Then she said, “I’m sorry, but we must protect ourselves.” 

Neither farmer paid the apology any mind, and kept on ramming the blocked door with their shoulders. 

Their was a distant *bomf!* and the rolling thunder of musket-fire, then a brief whizzing noise. Jeremiah, on the left side of the door, slumped down, and Rodney fell backwards, face dotted with the blood of his friend and chest dented by a crumpled Minié ball. Rodney wheezed a few times, then fell silent; Jeremiah didn't so much as squeak, he'd died instantly. 

The Reverend stumbled back, fell on his ass, then got up again. He briefly believed the Witch had worked black magic on Jeremiah and Rodney, but then he realized it was ammunition resting in Rodney’s new chest cavity—it was ammunition that had blown out Jeremiah’s ribs like a finger punching through paper. He turned to the side and dry heaved a few times. 

Behind him, the congregation began screeching and screaming and crying, and dispersed, down into the town. 

The Reverend saw the Witch’s feet break up the light coming out from under the door. She slowly, carefully, opened it, and stepped outside. Upon seeing no one, aside from the dead men and the Reverend, she sighed. The Witch turned toward a tree-salted hill some 45 meters away, and waved. He saw a glint of metal moving back and forth: her husband, it must have been, the soldier. 

The Reverend quivered in fear, and let loose a slight jet of urine. ""Please, don't... please don't kill me.""

""You tried to have me killed. You had them, those two men, try to break into my house.""

""That... that cannot be proved,"" he said, suddenly feeling a bit more brave. ""And no one will believe you! It's the Witch's word against the man of God."" 

""Then,"" she said, ""I guess there can only be *my* word."" She looked out toward the trees, over the other hill. The glint shone three times. The Witch nodded, and pointed down to the Reverend. ""I warned you, my conscience will remain unburdened."" 

""*Damn* you, Witch. *Damn you to Hell*."" The final words from the lips of this holy man, for Michael fired his musket straight through the Reverend's head. When the Minié ball tore through and sailed away, into the ether, there were no lips left to speak from. Teeth and blood dotted the path. 

Anne was sickened by the sight, but enlivened by the relief. 

They'd have to call down the magistrate and the lawman, to verify what happened here, and then, she didn't care, the people, the town, whoever... they could have the damned house. She wouldn't stay in Salem for even one more night. 

She looked toward her husband, saw the glint of metal, and smiled. Anne could tell he was looking back with love.

"[WP] A sharpshooter and his accused-witch wife standoff against the town authorities. Salem Village, 1692.",tomatoaway,"“They’re going to be here any second now.” 

Anna nodded gravely, but her eyes shone glassy and pink. 

“Perhaps… maybe they can be reasoned with?” This he said pleadingly. 

Anna silently disagreed, sad smile communicating her mild exasperation. He just needed to accept it. 

“Right. Of course they won’t. You’re a witch, after all,” he said, grinning dangerously, manic edge to his voice, “and the words of a witch and her thrall are not to be tolerated.” Michael closed his eyes, trying to calm down, it seemed, but bashed the hardwood surface of the dining table. His rifle had been jostled, and started to lean away from the table, tipping. He caught it without seeing. 

Anna didn’t even stir; she was just glad not to be crying, such always had her feeling like a silly little girl again. Sitting in her father’s lap and gibbering on about the most inane ideas until he’d suddenly grunt, That’s enough! and tell her to go bother her mother. She’d cry, of course, but she’d also be left wondering how he could be so agreeable one moment and so odious the next... 

She pushed down the memory, and approached Michael. He had since looked up from the table, and was staring at her with concerned and caring eyes, grey like the dual moons: that sky-hung ornament and, below, its silvery, lake-bound reflection. He was the embodiment of everything her father was not. 

Handsome, lithe, hair so black it was almost blue, a smile as beguiling as Eros; and intentions and loyalties so stalwart and true that none could ever be mistaken or misinterpreted. Unlike her father—who was a moody, opinionated self-congratulating oaf—Michael was intelligent, rational, and skilled; he observed situations and decided the inherent Truths therein. Not like the unwavering sheeple of their town, who saw only what they wanted—who accepted a Truth only when it could aid them. Michael was humble, honest, determined, and held fast to his word. 

This is what made him such an awesome man and such a dangerous soldier. 

He never talked about the wars, the battles, but sometimes, under the right light, she could see some distant shimmer beneath his dark lashes. Something that bespoke the horror he’d seen, the horror he’d no doubt caused. And there were the medals: golds and silvers with tassels or ribbons, very showy. He was a decorated killer, and Anna didn’t care—she loved him, he was her protector. 

Still, she knew he found comfort in pulling a trigger, found relief in hitting his targets. Michael blew apart pests and bottles, weekly—ostensibly practicing for when, “England comes a-knocking, and I’m needed for duty again.” But when he’d come to the colonies, and they’d met for the first time, he’d confided that he was done with war, and would be staying in Massachusetts for the remainder of his life, if indeed he had a good enough reason. Anne had been his reason, and at the age of 27, after 13 years of fighting for the rights of rich, powerful men, he (with Anne) had settled in Salem, rather by necessity. 

As uncaring and insensitive as Anne’s father had been, he’d been even more frugal and efficient when it came to business. Controlling a decent portion of the lumber and shipbuilding trade for the mid-most colonies—thus Anne’s presence in a port town when Michael had first arrived—her father had had enough money and resources to both buy and build personal locations all throughout the colonies. 

Salem was one of the towns where he’d bought property and built a cottage, a couple years before Anne and Michael got together. Her father, Englishman by birth, had been impressed and enamored with Michael, and, with news of their engagement, had gifted to the couple the Salem residence. No other place to go, the two began their life together in the picturesque town. 

The picturesque town had not been very receptive.  

Michael and Anne were seen as untrustworthy, for their ideals were not so puritan, and after Anne  confronted one of the local priests about harmful ideas being spread in the church, everyone suddenly became chilly towards the couple. People passed her in the streets and threw her suspicious looks, glared at her or guided their children away. She stopped going to Mass because it seemed that the reverends would somehow be alluding to her, whenever they talked about sinful behavior or the devilrous intent. Michael didn’t mind, he found reading the bible was just as good, but he did mind the way Salemites stared at him pityingly—how they made the holy cross when he passed, would mutter about the poor, ensorcelled man. 

Anne wasn’t the only one being targeted, though. Through this year of 1692, some kind of hysteria had risen up in the nearby colonies. People talking about spectres and ghouls and devils. Teenage girls all over the village had been shrieking names and then ‘fainting,’ implicating hapless folk in satanic deeds. This had been going on for over three months since, and it was coming to a head. Seven women so far had been hung, two more had been burned or stabbed outside of the town’s judicial system. Passage out of the town had been barred, excusing extreme circumstance. 

Three days ago, one of the girls, Mabel, had gurgled out Anne’s name, defecated, vomited, and then finally fallen over, right onto a collection of brick. She’d suffered a serious head wound, and a mob was stirring in the wake of such a tragic event. Which they wholeheartedly believed was Anne’s fault. She and Michael had been warned yesterday by the visiting magistrate and lawman, both of whom came from out of town and were only in Salem to oversee just indictment and legal procedure. 

They had offered protection, but when questioned, admitted they probably wouldn’t be able to hold back the mob. 

Michael had looked to Anne, she had shaken her head, and he’d kindly told them that he and his wife would be protecting themselves, as human nature dictates. 

“Anne.” 

Anne wiped her eyes, shook her head a little bit, and then came around the table, to Michael’s side. He was looking up at her. She bent down, and wrapped her arms around his neck, breathed in his scent.

“I love you, Michael,” she said, quietly, and placed a kiss on his ear. 

He turned his face, so his lips were against hers. “I love you, too, Anne.” He frowned. “But the time for embracing will come later.” 

“Yes, it *will*,” she whispered, eyes suggestive. 

“Now,” Michael continued, “is the time to defend.” ",Lobdir

[EU] Hydra begins to suspect that they've been infiltrated by Doctors Without Borders,CraftedLove,"We began noticing things, in the beginning. You see, our goal was world domination, first and foremost.

So who were we to question if we decided to go into unstable countries? We thought we were infiltrating foreign governments, and controlling the medical infrastructure of a country was the perfect way to do so. Who were we to question if maybe we spent a little more on medical equipment than on guns. It was all part of a plan, right?

In the end, Hydra did achieve its goal of world domination. Not in the way we expected.

As countries collapsed, so did education systems. The one thing that would never collapse- private organizations. We started small, opening universities in Africa, capitalizing on the instability in Asia, and moved on to a crumbling European Union. We controlled most of the world, and the people didn't even know it. We controlled nuclear arsenals. Many of the world's leaders were puppets serving the needs of Hydra. With the combined support of China's, Russia's, Korea's, Europe's, and Africa's armies, we ruled most of the world.

Hydra started crumbling, too. We didn't realize it, but many of our key leaders were slowly sent to destabilized areas to set up hospitals. Many of our leaders died in an ""accidental"" U.S. airstrike on a Palestinian hospital. 

So Doctors Without Borders took over, and we never saw it coming. What we thought was a front for our organization, our organization actually was a front for their organization. The last refuges- North America and South America- were quickly taken over. Years of government instability had crippled South America and they quickly accepted Doctors Without Borders's help. 

In North America, the United States willingly surrendered themselves to the larger government. After all, the people enjoyed the refreshing third party of Doctors Without Borders, versus Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Mexico fell to its own corruption, and Canada viewed being part of the leadership of Doctors Without Borders like being in the Commonwealth.

Under the leadership of Doctors Without Borders, the world prospered. Children were taught the importance of community service from the beginning of their education. Innovation was incentivized and paid for, unlike the previous governments. Regional conflicts declined as a lack of borders caused an unprecedented racial and social mixing. Americans in Russia. Russians in China. Palestinians with Israelis. Muslims with Christians. Jewish with the Middle Easterners. 

Government became more honest, too, because the only people to join Doctors Without Borders are the ones who are selfless. The ones who cared about others more than themselves. The ones that DESERVED to lead.

Hydra achieved its goal of world domination, under Doctors Without Borders. The world had become a better place, under the leadership of selfless men.

The first time it happened my titan had got away, but no more. My workshop was laced with steel one way in, one way out. I continued my passion painting and forming soldiers who would be battled in great wars, and little men who would be my puppets for D&amp;D. Laws were passed quite quickly making toys more expensive and now they had rights, the idiots at congress believed they could feel pain, mainly because they screamed as people forced them into positions on a plastic base. It didnt take long before warhammer40k was outlawed completely and my armies taken away, though i couldnt live without my plastic crack, a black market had opened up though i cost me a arm and a leg, i was able to get my fix. There screams now haunted my dreams but i could not stop, i think my fatass neighbour steve was responsible for the call that alerted the cops to by ""hobby"" the first time they game, i made a mistake I killed them, i stuck there dead bodys on plastic bases and tortured them, im not entirely sure why i just got a thrill out of the screams i now had lifesized space marines to play with and miniture space wolves to wage war with. It didnt take long for the authorities to notice missing operatives, and then i heard it ""Knock Knock"" I peared out my window barely enough to let a shred of light in and noticed enough police cars to conduct a siege ready to burst down my door. I went down to my workshop locked the door, and i shall enjoy my self until the time comes.

Himika stared at Derryl intensely, fire blazing in her eyes like the pyrokinesis she had just used. Despite Derryl being her foster father, Himika had been slowly and gradually growing to dislike Derryl more than flames to water.

""Well, I'm sorry!"" Sarcasm filled Himika's voice alongside the feelings of obvious fury. ""I'm not an expert at pyrokinesis yet, am I? I can't help if the flames get huge, can I?"" She stomped her foot on the ground.

""I've been teaching you for WEEKS now, Himika, how the Hell haven't you got this right by now? You know how to conjure fire up perfectly and to keep it stable. Is it so difficult to make it smaller at this point?""

Himika was in such a towering rage that she was shaking. She stared down Derryl like she was about to charge like a bull.

""I'm sick of you! I can't be bothered to be told what to do with my powers! I'll learn myself, I'll-"" 

Himika's voice was cut of by a strange swishing, crumbling sound. Derryl was making the ground tremble. Chunks of the earth started lifting up and surrounding him, moving up together  to form a huge ball of earth. 

Geokinesis, thought Himika.

""You think you can get away from your own father, huh?"" laughed Derryl. 

""You're no father of mine!"" Himika screeched back.

""Hahahahaha...""

An enormous cluster of hardened mud came flying towards Himika, hitting her in the chest and knocking the breath out of her. She fell to the ground, gasping for air, grasping the strands of grass.

The man in the expensive three-piece suit facepalmed.

""Bigger?"" he demanded. ""*Christ*, Jerry, our entire engineering department complex is up in flames! You wanted to know why we kept you away from the matches? *This is the fucking reason*, Jerry.""

""...It was dark in there,"" Jerry offered.

Mr. Doe let out an exasperated scream at his moronic colleague's remark as Mr. Mulligan and Mr. Roberts rushed to join them in the courtyard.

""Let me guess,"" Mr. Mulligan groaned as the accounting expert next to him stared wide-eyed at the carnage.

""Jerry,"" Mr. Doe answered, prompting a confused ""What?"" from the cause of the disaster.

""You know damn well what,"" Mr. Roberts shrieked. ""*Why* did our CEO send *you* over there to light the candles? He could have just sent an intern! And now... just look... oh, the horror...""

The man fainted as the two businessmen and arsonist looked on.

""Where is our CEO, anyway?"" Mr. Doe remarked.

As if on cue, a well-dressed man covered in ash with a smoldering ember in his toupee cheerily walked over and greeted his fellow Board members (and Jerry).

""Nice day, isn't it?"" the CEO said nonchalantly while snacking on some singed Cheetos. ""Sure, there's a lot of clouds in the sky, but they should move to the west before the next front comes in.""

""And then we set them on fire?"" Jerry inquired reflexively.

""NO MORE FIRES,"" Mr. Mulligan exclaimed, turning to his boss. ""You alright, sir?""

""I just got out of engineering,"" the CEO replied calmly. ""Quite a ruckus - judging by how hot it was in there, I bet they were testing out the new equipment. Lot of noise they were making, though - I warned them about the ordinance, but I could still hear them hollering after I locked the door behind me.""

Even Jerry had to stare at him wide-eyed.

""You locked... the main exit?"" Mr. Doe whispered in alarm.

""Standard procedure,"" the CEO noted. ""Except in the case of an emergency.""

""...What do you think this was, sir?"" Mr. Mulligan said, facepalming again.

""Just a drill, right? A very... realistic drill? I'll be sure to brief those boys in there on their response time.""

""And then we set them on fire?"" 

""For fuck's sake, Jerry,"" Mr. Doe shrieked, shaking his head. ""They're on fire already! Probably dead by now, in fact. Thanks to you... BOTH OF YOU. *Heavens.* Boss, how could you have let this happen?""

The CEO stood silent for awhile.

""Cheeto?"" he offered.

With that, Mr. Doe stormed off in a huff, announcing his immediate resignation.

""Hey, come back!"" the CEO yelled after him, before noticing the smoke rising from the buildings. ""Well, what do you know - that *was* a fire. Well, on the bright side, we don't have to worry about our profit margin next quarter; I'm sure the insurance payout is going to be huge.""

""B-b-but..."" Mr. Mulligan sputtered. ""It doesn't work that way! Ugh, for the love of... I quit too!""

The CEO and Jerry stared as the two businessmen strode off, then looked down at the unconscious accounting expert. Suddenly, he, too, rolled away into the distance, much to their surprise.

""Wha... hey!"" the CEO screamed. ""You'll never find work in this town again! You hear that! Ugh... those guys always did get on my nerves... telling me I couldn't snack in my own office. I oughta call them back here and give them what for!""

""And then we set them on fire?""

""...Sure, Jerry, why not.""

Jerry smiled excitedly.

"[WP] ""I said set a small fire!! This is not small!""",Lexilogical,"Captain Farnham stared on as the flames of the burning port-city danced to their fiery rhythm. He screamed in complete horror and panic for a while, as should be expected of any normal, decent captain, before turning to the mook who brought about this little mishap in the first place.

The little mage Briar, a recruit picked up by the Sorceress-Marshal, simply smiled giddily as her handiwork continued to slaughter thousands of innocent lives. Innocent being a misnomer, as the only innocent people in war are already dead to begin with.

""I was hoping to siege that city, you know,"" said Farnham with an awed expression across his sleepy face, ""When I said a small fire, I was hoping for something along the lines of a candlelight so the men could see their way through the invasion camp.""

""Yea?"" came the young mage sitting on a sand dune as she stared through a spyglass at the blazing port-town of the Shadowfolk.

Farnham had seen many war atrocities during his service in this particular arid land that his majesty's army had ordered him to: impromptu battles, unprovoked sea raids, unprovoked village raids, unwanted panty raids, and many more. But, never in his five years as an officer, had he ever had the misfortune of seeing a sixteen year-old girl laughing as she decided to land a fireball right into a densely-populated area.

It was absurd. It was uncalled for. It was overkill. Farnham sighed and promised himself to start drinking more so that he could avoid situations like these into the future.

""You're not going to do this very often, are you?"" Farnham had a quiver of fear in his voice, ""I mean, you don't have the ABILITY to do this very often, right?""

""Yea,"" Briar replied.

""Thank god. For a minute there, I thought I didn't have an excuse to not send you to burn down every castle west of here until we get to the damned Shadow Capital.""

""Yea?"" the witch-girl shrugged. She pulled out her staff again and started to draw runes into the sand, singing an odd slur of words all the while.

Another fireball appeared out of the sky, streaking through the air with a great flash of light, before smashing right into the town-lord's castle. A loud screech of panic filled the air that was suddenly quieted by the sound of slightly louder screech of just burning to death.

Briar smiled proudly at the sight. Farnham fainted face-first into the harsh, sandy sand of the dune. The port-town continued to burn, and Briar continued to let loose the fireballs that would win the war in the Shadowland, which would later be inappropriately renamed ""Burntland"", then, after some minor lapse in controversy, ""The Blacklands"", and then finally, ""No Travel Zone: Unsafe for Entry.""

I thought we had plenty of time to leave. When people rushed the markets, I told my wife there was no need to stock up, we would leave before things got that bad. How wise I was then.

""The flight before ours was shot down by a surface to air missile. Even months later, we would see the wreckage just outside the city limits. Of course, further flights were suspended. We had nowhere to go, so we went home.

""Just as well, I suppose. The airport was shelled later that day. Emergency services responded, of course. Our new world hadn't settled in yet. Some were killed in the blast, but many would keep the hospital busy, and use its supplies.

""Once home I filled as many containers as I could with water from the bath. Our food lasted a couple of weeks. After that, we traded. It was electronics first, at my insistence. A month into the siege the power went down and they became useless. But we were fed and even had some canned food for the future.  

""Next it was luxury items--carpets, art, what-have-you. What good is culture when you are dead? We kept our furniture. Not for creature comforts, of course. Winter loomed ahead, and we might need it for burning, for heat and cooking.

""Five weeks after the lock down started we heard a shot next door. I waited a day, then went to investigate it. My neighbor had killed himself. I didn't know him that well, just that he lived alone, so I felt little guilt when I checked his pantry. Enough for a few more days.

""Seven weeks into the siege we almost nothing. The markets were empty. Some neighbors called on me one day. They knew some people that had prepared, had hoarded supplies we could all use. A handful of people living in practical luxury while the rest of us starved! They told me they had a plan. That we could make sure those supplies were more equitably distributed.

""I agreed and we went to see these people. We did...we did what needed to be done.

""The supplies we divided among ourselves were not as plentiful as we'd hoped.

""My neighbors and I pooled our resources and manpower. All I can say is the things you do to survive are numerous, and become easier over time. No one can see into the future, so one must do everything they can to keep believing the future actually exists.

""After three months, the siege was lifted. The parting artillery barrage was no doubt meant to make a statement of strength. Some of us had been...scavenging...at the time. The peace was so sudden, we didn't know the nightmare was over for another day.

""One of those last shells had landed directly on my house. To think that everything I did could be for nothing. Even today I don't think I would stoop so low in the muck just for my own life.

""The shell was a dud. It punched a hole in my roof and rested comfortably in our bathroom. My wife and I left the country later that week, and we've built quite a comfortable life here. The city itself has recovered quite nicely. If you were to go there today you wouldn't know the hell so many endured. With each passing day, the event fades in the world's memory a little more.

""Boy! I've made clear time and again! I don't..."" I stifled my shout as I saw Leon's saddening and shocked face. He looks so much like his father. I suppose I may as well tell him, with there being so little time left for me. I sigh and stroke my beard, these days as white as the fresh sails of a newly Christened schooner.

Leon sits in the armchair next to me, lighting a cigar and listening intently to me despite the thudding newfangled music now quietly emanating from the gramophone.

""Hear me and hear me well, boy. My tale has been dormant for so many years now, and you shan't find such a telling in any of your books and documents. Many, many years ago, your father and I joined the crew of the *His Majesty's Ship Lady Kinnegard*. We were average able-bodied seamen on a research expedition...


SOMEWHERE IN A FREEZING SEA, MANY YEARS AGO


Captain Byron, sound asleep, has no idea what we few men were plotting. We have been toiling in these frozen waters for weeks on end now, only surviving on by boiling the ice shards we withdrew from the wintry sea surrounding us to the ends of all horizons. Smoke from our furnaces and stoves is battered incessantly by the cruel winds that sent the chills of Hell itself into your very bones. Our rations are nigh exhausted. We are, naturally, upset. 

My son sits besides me, listening to the protests of the others and dismissing them with ease. Though it pains me, I must agree with him - our voyage cannot continue in the state it is now. Something had to be done. But mutiny?
As he reviews the plan with his co-conspirators, I load more tobacco into my pipe. Upon the eve of morrow, everything shall change.


THE NEXT NIGHT


I awaken to the sounds of a scuffle. Have they begun already?
Jumping out of my hammock, I run up the starboard stairs to join the fray abovedeck.

As I draw my club, the sight of the battle puzzles me - the men, all of us who had gathered 'ere afore, are fighting eachother. Brothers, betrayals, all of us a Judas. Captain Byron already lays dead or near it, his blood soaking the planks of the ship in a wide arc, trampled by the feet of men pushed far past their limits, fighting each other like animals. They are snarling, biting, clawing, spit and blood is hurled into a howling wind in the chaos. The hair on my neck stands, as I frantically search for my father's bravery within myself, trying to decide who was against who.

""Father! Father, we fight for command! Higgins seeks to take the ship for himself!""

Jacob's call immediately summoned me, running, at the source of his shout. That bastard, Higgins. I rush to my son, ready at once to join the mad fighting at my son's side. As I approach Jacob, my heart plummets in futile terror. There is Higgins, bearing a rapier, his form covered in tears and a mixture of bloods. There is his rapier, that damned rapier... the blade protrudes out of Jacob's heart. Stabbed in the back. The betrayer, betrayed. I cease to function as a man, and the inky blackness of the suffocating arctic night slowly burns in the fires of my fury and glows crimson. 


MANY YEARS LATER, IN A GENTLEMAN'S STUDY

""You see, Leon... It was I. I was to take command of the *Lady Kinnegard*. It was my mutiny, my rebellion. Your father died for my own folly, my dear son. Once Higgins delivered the final blow to your father-""

""Lord's mercy, Grandfather,"" Leon interjects. His mouth open in awe, eyes wide. I raise a withered hand.

""No, my good Leon. It must be said, while it still may be. Do not interrupt. The Lord of Lies took hold of me at the moment of your father's death, and I was filled with His dark rage. With the might of Satan, I ignored all opposition, and crushed the bones of everyone on that ship. I cut through all of them, even our allies. I killed them all, Jacob, don't you see? They took my son from me, Jacob-""

""Er, Leon-""

""Leon, yes, and I made them all pay with their lives. Higgins was the last, and as he laid against the galley's entrance and watched his and my men be torn apart, I made his death long and slow. A burning calm took over me once my rage subsided, and I grew aware of what I had done. I was the one who sunk the ship after setting it aflame in those Northern waters... My life was to end there, too, in order to speed my most welcome damnation. I was unaware we were being observed by the fishing boat. They dragged me, lame and unconscious from the freezing waters, and took me home to your mother. There was no enemy attack - it was all me. And they named me Hero in response to my silence. I remember them all - Jacob, Higgins, Byron, Sanders, even the cabin boys. They all died because of me. I see all their faces and fear sleep. Forever shall their ghosts haunt me, like a painful memorial etched in my soul. When I burn in Hell, it shall be they who roast my flesh.""

"[TT] ""Forever shall their ghosts haunt me, like a painful memorial etched in my soul.""",Nate_Parker,"I am plagued by the ghosts of those who do not know me. 

&amp;nbsp;

They plague me like blind men asking for alms. They do not see me, but I see them with my own inactions. I give no alms, for I have fashioned myself as a man who does not exist in the plane of the living whom they call for. I do not have anything to give, but I hear them just the same.

&amp;nbsp;

I hate my ghosts, and yet I call them mine despite not being theirs, for I hear their cries. Their voices linger and look for someone else that isn't me. Their fingers are cold and in search of their loved ones they sometimes pass through me, leaving me stifled and petrified. They do not speak to me. They do not put their blames on me, for they do not know me, but I know them. 

&amp;nbsp;

They are everyone I never helped. I have watched them suffer, fashioned myself as a living ghost. They have died but death merely made their presence stronger. By death, they now exist in the plane I have existed in. They haunt me. 

&amp;nbsp;

Laurel cries for her husband who left her, for her children who never visited her, and for her neighbour who might join her soon. She does not call for me, the man who passed by her house for nearly ten years, who always saw her knitting alone on her porch, with a cat that has a fur as white as her hair.

&amp;nbsp;

""*I could have helped you.*"" I sometimes tell her when I see her weeping on her porch, long after she was buried. ""*I could have helped you.*"" I often repeat, but despite being a ghost, she does not see me - the living ghost. I have fashioned myself a ghost and yet I am unseen by those whom I call my kind. 

&amp;nbsp;

Owen and Veronica are the youngest among those who haunt me. They are the kids of my alcoholic coworker, John. They are the sweetest, often merely just playing a game of hide and seek. They call for _Mommy_ and never of John, their _Daddy_ , and comfort themselves when no one answers back. They cannot see me, but I do not know if they can hear me. I am afraid of talking to them and saying, ""*I know your father, do you want me to take you to him?*"" . It is only John who I know, and he is not a good father. Can real ghosts feel fear? Can they feel my guilt? 

&amp;nbsp;

But, out of all of them, my oldest ghost is Emma. She is perpetually twelve years old. She was never in my class but I know who she is - she who has lovely wide brown eyes and a tuft of untameable blonde hair. I still remember how I saw her saying goodbye to her friends and getting into a blue car with a man with cutting blue eyes, and never seen again. I remember how my parents tucked me in every night after that, and how the school gave her a memorial that still hasn't ended.

&amp;nbsp;

""*I could have done something.*"" I tell her, always, whenever I see a blue car and her saying goodbye. Always just a goodbye. ""*I could have.*""

&amp;nbsp;

I am plagued by the ghosts of those who do not know me. Their memorials are forever etched and ongoing within my mind, soaked with tears of other men and women - but never of mine. 

&amp;nbsp;

I am, and was, a ghost. I could have done something, but I hadn't. Like them, I will forever call for those who cannot and will not hear me. They call for the living. They call for those who are not me. I hear them, but they do not hear me.

&amp;nbsp;

I was unseen, and I am still.

Whenever I brought it up, she always found some way to avoid the subject. I had tried to interview her once in eighth grade for a school project that involved family culture and history, but even then she stubbornly refused to tell me more than I already knew.

*****

“I move here from Philippines,” she said in slightly broken English, “with you, your Kuya Raul, and your Tatay, when you were all very young.” 

“Mom, I need to know a lot more than that. I can’t do a presentation unless I have a lot more information.”

“Okay. Ah, and when we move here to California, and we buy an apartment. We save money to buy a small house. So now we are here.” She smiled, satisfied with her vignette.

“That’s good,” I nodded appreciatively. “But… I need you to talk about a lot more. Like, what was your childhood like? Where did you go to school? How did you meet Dad?”

“*Anak*,” she said, switching to Tagalog, which was a sign of her patience growing thin. “*Just make something up. You like to write, don’t you?*”

“Yeah, but this is one of those things I can’t just *make up*.”

“*Ay, anak ko…*” she sighed. “*I grew up in a poor village, I worked hard to sell candies and studied hard at school, and I got a job here. What more can I say?*” Before I could convince her otherwise, she got up and mumbled an excuse about taking the clothes out of the washing machine.

***** 

I ended up fabricating a detailed story about our family history, of course. Although, if I were asked to retell it today, I’d be caught. Even if I wrote it and practiced it, the passage of thirty-four years is enough to make anyone forget. I looked at the mirror to comb my hair, dark brown and silvery white strands weaving together.

“I’m getting old like you, Mom.” I looked up and smiled.

I drove with Kuya Raul to the old house, and we were greeted with the faintly familiar scent of steamed rice. It was tidy, as usual, perhaps because Mom anticipated that the day when she would have to pass it down to us was fast approaching. 

I wandered upstairs and glanced at the family photos that lined the stairway. Me, with chubby cheeks, grinning at the camera. Kuya Raul, dressed in overalls and holding a basketball. Dad and Mom waving in front of the newly bought house. With each step came a wave of nostalgia, and finally, I reached the upper floor. I peeked into my bedroom. It had remained untouched, the flowery sheets still adorned the bed and my stuffed toys were still piled on the dresser. Kuya Raul’s room, of course, stayed bland, with plain blue sheets. The only item of interest in the room was the lonely model airplane hanging from the ceiling. 

Then, my mother’s room. It had the haunting smell of powder and her favorite perfume. I was rarely allowed into the room as a child, for my mother feared that at my naturally mischievous and destructive age, I would draw on the walls or spill something on the floor or the sheets. 

I began to leave, but I noticed the glint of something under the dresser. Curiosity got the best of me, and I got on my hands and knees and peered under the bed. I reached my hand to grab the object and pulled it out. It was a small wooden chest about the size of a shoebox, embellished with carvings of plants. Like the rest of the items in the house, it had a thick layer of dust and cobwebs. I pinched my nose and blew, and the dust scattered around. I opened the box, and looked at the contents within.

Some jewellry, two Ziploc bags containing Kuya Raul’s and my own baby teeth, pictures of us playing in the park, a picture of Dad in uniform, a tattered coin purse… and a carefully folded piece of paper. I plucked the paper out and opened it up.

A letter. Entirely in Tagalog, and written in my mother’s cursive handwriting.

Never before had I seen her express so many words before.

My heart began to pound as I began to read the letter, translating it to English in my head.

“*Dear Alvin,*

*I lost another one today, at 7:13. What sin have I committed? What did they do to deserve this punishment? Disease has taken my first, the river took my second, and now God has taken my third before he even had a chance to live. ‘Have faith,’ they tell me. But how can I?*

*Yet, since I will not confess to God, I will confess to you.*

*This afternoon I went to Sofia’s house to give her the things we had bought for the baby, so she could give them to her own children. She didn’t answer, so I went inside, and she was lying on the floor, unmoving. She was not breathing and I began to panic, until I heard the sound of two children crying in the upper rooms.*

*Alvin, I went up there and I began to weep with them and for them. They did not deserve the scrutiny that would come if I left them there for the authorities. They deserved a normal life, the chance to be raised in a happy world.*

"[TT] ""Forever shall their ghosts haunt me, like a painful memorial etched in my soul.""",Nate_Parker,"The worst part is the waiting. It's when you've got time to kill, time to spare, and nothing is happening even though every fibre of your body is willing it to happen. And nothing happens. 

So far the jungle is quiet. Steadily, tiredly, the platoon move forward, sweat dripping off their faces, washing away the warpaint. I can see their indecision. They could be anywhere. Five strong they marched silently. They didn't know what they were looking for, of course - but they had a damn good idea. As a general rule this wasn't always enough. It wasn't like the movies back home, or the chess games other played, there was no black or white in the jungle - there was only red. And it could come from anywhere, at any time-

Was that a bang?

No, just a twig, snapped underfoot. 

The youngest of the lot is on the side. He's the only one that hasn't done his time here, the only one still fresh out of boot camp. His face screams silently, but his eyes are resolute. It's not safe around here, he thought. No war was ever safe, but this one felt like it would explode any second.

And then all of a sudden it did.

The silence was broken by a terrified yelp. As one the men turn to look around. It had happened, it had actually happened, and the bullets were zipping through the air, and there was no time to react, no time to shoot back. The jungle seemed to sweat bombs. Where were they? Where, damnit-

A grenade landed amongst the platoon. They barely had enough time to dive before it went off.

The explosion is deafening, the light blinding. I saw a leg fly past me and just miss my face. The trouser was still attached to it. In the smoke, I see the remaining men shudder to their feet, weapons raised, shooting blindly. In my dreams I can always see where the enemy is. But they can't. They never could. They might have hit one or two - but the enemy is always all around you. It's in the air that you breathe and the sweat on your face, or in the grit between your teeth. It's in the tropical gunpowder. 

And they died, one by one, bodies cut through with bullets like so many leaves, screams echoing in the jungle. They died fighting. They died screaming. They died begging for mercy. I watched it all happen again, and of course I could do absolutely nothing, as quickly the enemy killed them all, cut through them like paper. All except one.

I see him now, terrified, hiding in the undergrowth, his body hidden by his size, his rifle unfired. He was barely seventeen and he had been so, so enthusiastic, so quick to join up - but he was a fucking coward.

I'm sixty-four now. Until the day I die I will not forget those moments, the time when a seventeen-year old boy escaped with his life where grown men did not. I won't be able to undo anything I did on that day. And there was nothing I could have done. But I know I could have shot back. Fought and died rather than hid and lived. And that knowledge haunts me every time I wake up.

Every year since then I march in the parade. I hope my kids don't ask me about my time. I see the others, people like me, who had come home heroes, those with purple hearts and purple scars, and I wondered if they knew I was not like them. I wondered what they would have done. I watch them grow old, get older, and steadily die. Less and less people march in the annual parade. As year follows year, more old men disappear...someday no-one will march there at all.

This year I stop to take a look at the memorial wall. Several thousand names, all dead now, lives wrenched from families that never recovered. After a while I sat down. I knew I could never get them back - knew there was nothing I could do to make them un-dead. But still they haunt me. They are here in the reflecting pool, they are there and everywhere in the whispering wind. Forever shall their ghosts haunt me, like a painful memorial etched in my soul. Silently, I stand up, salute, and walk away.

"[TT] ""Forever shall their ghosts haunt me, like a painful memorial etched in my soul.""",Nate_Parker,"""You'll be fine, Abram,"" Jeremy said. ""Got everything?""

I gave him a shaky thumbs up, breathing hard behind my full-faced mask. My movements felt sluggish under my uniform, and the ax wasn't helping. Looking up at the apartment before us, which was throwing up copious amounts of smoke from its windows, I found myself wishing to be anywhere but here.

""First time's the hardest,"" Kieran said, patting me on the back. ""Just follow Jeremy and you'll be fine.""

""Let's go. Floor by floor sweep."" Jeremy trotted into the building, Kieran and I bringing up the rear.

I was already sweating rivers underneath my gear, but the heat inside ... nothing in my training had ever prepared me for it. Visibility was poor; I could barely make out Jeremy's outline through the hazy grayness. We ignored the little flames on the first floor. Our buddies would take care of them.

The first major blaze we encountered was on the third story. Angry flames ate at the wood and plaster walls, turning brick to dust and shattering glass. Kieran stepped forward with his extinguisher.

""This one isn't really that bad,"" he said.

I nodded, but froze when I heard a sound above the growling fires. It was a voice; high-pitched and faint.

""Did you guys hear that?""

Jeremy had cocked his ear toward the end of the corridor, where the stairs were. ""Came from there. C'mon.""

""I thought they evacuated the building?"" Kieran said.

""I definitely heard something,"" I said.

Jeremy tried the door to the stairs, but it wouldn't budge. ""Damned thing's stuck.""

""Ax it a question,"" Kieran said, grinning.

Hefting our axes, Jeremy and I began chopping away at the door. There was definitely someone shouting behind it, which only made me work faster. But another sound became apparent too; an ominous creaking.

When the hole was sufficiently large, I looked through it to see a man and three children huddled on the stairs. Seeing my face, they began screaming, and the man began shoving the children toward me.

""Take them,"" he said, trying to force a girl through the hole.

While Jeremy and I helped pull her over to our side, I said, ""Just give us a while to widen the hole.""

""Not enough time,"" he said softly, handing us a crying boy. ""The upper floors are collapsing.""

""You should've taken the stairs down,"" Jeremy said.

He shook his head and pointed. Where the stairs leading to the lower floors had once been, there was only a gap to the next landing. ""It's a bit of a fall. The kids won't make it, but I can try. Please, just take them.""

After the third child came through, a girl no older than four, I raised my ax again. However, Jeremy held my arm.

""We don't have time for this,"" he said. ""Our priority's to get the kids out first.""

""But—""

""We'll meet on the second floor, okay?"" Jeremy said to the man, who nodded.

""Guys,"" Kieran said. ""Anyone got another extinguisher?""

We turned to see that the hallway was now even more heavily obscured by smoke. The flames had leaped up anew, raging harder than before, and pieces of the ceiling were tumbling down like hail.

""Just keep low, okay, kids?"" Jeremy said, handing them oxygen masks. Turning to me, he said, ""Take point, Abram. Use that ax if you have to.""

I licked my lips and jogged ahead, my feet feeling like jelly. The building was breaking apart. We could all hear the shattering, the impact of ruined masonry somewhere over our heads. The hallway seemed to stretch on forever.

One of the apartment doors we were passing suddenly exploded. The children screamed behind me as I, giving in to panic, threw myself forward.

Kieran was howling in pain, but I couldn't see him. Not behind the sudden wall of cracked, smoldering timber and loose bricks that separated me from the rest of them.

""You okay, Abram?"" Jeremy shouted. ""The kids are fine, but Kieran's hurt. Help me clear the way.""

I looked at the rubble, and then at my ax, suddenly feeling very disconnected from my surroundings. The blade gleamed, blood-red, from the dancing fire around me. It seemed so pathetic, a tiny tool made from human hands, against the very forces of nature.

""Abram? Are you there?"" I heard his ax bite into wood, but the pile of rubble shifted not at all. Above us, through the hole, I watched as even larger pieces of the building came apart, fissures appearing in the walls that had miraculously survived until now.

""Abram!""

I dropped the ax and ran, hands jammed over my head, as though I could stop myself from hearing his voice. Kieran's cries of pain. The children.

Oh God. The children.

"[TT] ""Forever shall their ghosts haunt me, like a painful memorial etched in my soul.""",Nate_Parker,"As the prisoner was shuffled into the room, the jingle of leg shackles disrupted the silence of the mostly empty room. After he was seated, the man across the table set down the assortment of papers he had been handling, adjusted his tie, and cleared his throat before speaking.

“Good afternoon Mr. Neal. I am the Parole Examiner assigned to your hearing. I’ve reviewed your case and all relevant statements given on your behalf. Currently, this is the first eligibility you have had for parole. Several of the staff of the institution have indicated that you have been an exemplary prisoner, with no issues with behavior or compliance to policies. There have been no instances of conflict with other inmates. In all, you seem to be genuinely remorseful of your past conduct, the results of which lead you to be incarcerated within this facility. Would you agree with that?”

“Yes sir,” the prisoner said. “I would agree to that.”

“In reviewing your case, it appears that six years ago, on the morning of September 9th, you were highly intoxicated while operating a motor vehicle. In your inebriated state you caused an accident that involved a school bus and resulted in the deaths of twelve students and two additional adults. This was, needless to say, a tragic incident certainly meriting a harsh punishment. It would appear that you plead guilty to all charges, despite the advice of your legal counsel, and made no attempt to receive a lesser sentence.  Prior to that, you have no history of any legal misconduct, alcohol related or otherwise.""

“That’s true sir. I’ve always committed to being a law-biding citizen.” The prisoner said. “That was the first, last, and only time I ever got behind the wheel after having a even a single drink. Not a moment goes by that I’m not reminded of what that one mistake cost others.”

“I have no doubts as to the genuineness of your remorse, Mr. Neal,” the Parole Examiner said. “It’s rare, in my line of work, to review a case where I have such little doubt of such. Is there any reason to believe that if you were to be released on parole, there would be any repeat instances where you would put yourself or others in danger?”

“No sir,” the prisoner said. “I’ve never wanted to put anyone in danger.”

“Is there any reason you can think of that you should be denied parole?”

The prisoner said silently a moment before he spoke.

“Yes sir,” he said. “The truth is I have no desire for parole.”

“Is that because of the guilt you feel for your crime, sir?” the Examiner asked. “Do you feel unworthy of leniency or forgiveness?”

The prisoner sat silently for a few moments, cautiously looking about the nearly empty room.

“Well sir, I do feel guilty…no doubt about that,” he said. “When I said not a moment goes by that I’m not reminded of what my mistake cost others, I was telling the truth. You see, since the moment of that accident, all 14 of those people haven’t let me forget. The whole time I’ve been here, from the moment the cell door closed for the first time, they stand just outside the cell…silent, motionless, just staring at me with lifeless eyes. They’re in this very room right now. Now, I don’t believe they’ll ever leave, and I don’t believe that as long as I’m here they’ll do anything but stand there and stare…but I know they’re waiting for something. Whether they’re waiting for me to get out, or to pass on, or whatever it may be, they’re waiting… and I’m in no hurry to find out what it is they’re waiting for. So, no sir…I can’t think of one reason that I’d like to get out of here.”

The examiner took a drink from a styrofoam cup on the table, arranged some papers in front of him, and closed the folder that contained them. He paused a moment, then addressed the prisoner.

“Mr. Neal, I am going to deny parole and recommend a thorough psychiatric evaluation. I have no doubt that you regret your past actions, and I believe that in some way you are in fact haunted and tormented by the consequences of such.”

“Yes sir,” the prisoner said. “Forever shall their ghosts haunt me, like a painful memorial etched in my soul.”

[CW] The most horrifying thing you can think of... but keep it G-rated.,OMGitsMisha,"Winston woke up. He got out of the cryo-pod with difficulty, his muscles aching all over. Around him, the other pods were broken and covered in dust and grime. He didn't had to look inside their small windows to know that he was the last survivor.

""How long was I sleeping?"" He wondered, leaving the chamber behind. He climbed the stairs all the way to the top of the bunker.

The iron door awaited him.

""What if the computer made a mistake?"" The radiation could still be strong outside, and he would step out, and die. And yet... He was the last one, so it didn't matter. He could spend months eating the supplies inside the bunker, but months were nothing for the scale the radiation lived in. No, he would rather find out now.

So he went outside.

""This is impossible..."" Winston exclaimed, and fell to his knees over a patch of the greenest grass he had ever seen. It extended in all directions as far as he could see, and the air was warm and the sky blue and it was a bright summer day... As if the black clouds that came with the war had never existed.

A tear streamed down his cheek.

It was better than he could had hoped, he thought, while walking away from the old bunker.

""Maybe someone else is still alive,"" he dared to think, after walking for a while. He saw a family of rabbits, prancing away in the grass without a care in the world. They didn't run when he passed near them.

In the distance, near a small hill, he saw the bullet-shaped dome of another bunker. It was covered in grass, fully integrated with the environment, but the windows shone in the sun and gave it away. Winston's heart pounded in his chest and he ran.

""Hello? Anyone!"" He called, as he approached. ""I come in peace!"" He added, awkwardly, and waved his arms.

He arrived in front of the bunker and at once he discovered that the door was open. It looked new, even. Someone had definitely made a home in there...

He called again, and when no one answered, excitement won him over and he went inside. The floor of the bunker was green artificial grass, and a big bulky computer in the center showered the place with light from different colors.

""Anyone home?"" Winston repeated. He saw a child playing with a giant orange ball in a  corner, singing something to himself.

""Hey kid, are your parents home...?"" Winston asked, walking close. What a strange shape for a kid...

""Dipsy?"" The kid asked, and turned to face him, and Winston screamed, because that wasn't a child. Its huge mouth was like a cave, dark and deep and its body was covered in sickly green fur. It had a fur covered horn in the middle of its head and huge, empty, dead eyes stared at him without blinking.

""Dipsy?""

Winston ran out of the bunker. But when he stepped out the door, another monster was already waiting for him. This one was red and had a horn shaped like a small circle. It was smaller. With dawning horror, Winston realized it was smiling.

""Po?"" It asked him, waving little stump arms towards him. Its huge ears trembled with excitement.

""Please stay away from me.""

But a third one had already appeared. Yellow, with two small horns. It yelled ""Lala!"" and got closer.

A purple one came from the other side. It was the biggest one, and its flat eyes looked at Winston with no expression.

""Tinky Winky,"" it declared, slowly. And draw closer.

""Stay away!"" Winston roared. He tried to step back, inside the bunker, but he tripped and fell on his ass. He was now surrounded by the mutants in all directions, their full had a rancid, sweaty smell. The squares in their chests glowed, they were actually screens, and videos of children from before the war read letters with excited voices, in parks, their homes, their schools...

""Oh my god,"" Winston thought, astonished, ""those are the videos people sent us when the war was about to start, so we could show them to new generations.""

But the creatures were the only ones that remained, and they were alone with the ghosts of humanity's children inside their chests, for who knew how long...

They laughed and held him with their little arms. They were strong, so strong, stronger than they looked, and Winston screamed and screamed and looked up to the sky just before its view was covered by fur.

The sun was a giant, flaming baby's face, and it was smiling a toothless smile, and looking right at him.",Aikarus

""Of the great galactic guild guidebook. They put out the first new volume since they re-branded their entire company in order to stop lawyers from contacting them so easily."" Arthur's friend flopped down on the couch and threw his own holotab at Arthur, who failed to catch, or even flinch at the action, and thus took the device straight to the chin with the accompaniment of a distressed yelp.

""Why'd you do that?"" Arthur's friend said after enjoying the impact and the reaction to said impact.

""Because you bloody threw it at me!"" Arthur picked himself, and the chair he had been sitting on, back up from the floor and glared with whimpering intensity at the uncaring assailant, ""So why am I supposed to care about this...""

""Great galactic guild guidebook."" The reply came with expected amount of smugness.

""Why don't they call it G4?"" 

""Because then they'd get even more lawyers after them!"" Three arms were thrown up into the air in mock exasperation, ""Grawling greep, it's a wonder that brain of your can even move that jaw with the lack of processing power it is forced to lumber about with!""

He quickly digested the contents, and then slowly digested his feelings about it, ending the moment with a sigh that was both heartfelt and displaying that everything he had seen was both expected and an extreme disappointment.

"[WP] What is torture to aliens, is mundane to humans",Pimpin_Slav,"Our small gathering observed the monitor silently as the purified dihydrogen monoxide (DHM) was brought above the temperature needed to produce steam. Soon we knew, the liquid would be pressurized and aimed at the naked body of the captured human male. 

We had left planet d1f32 in isolation since it was first discovered in a protoplanetary disk. The closest to d1f32 any registered spacecraft had traveled was to large gas planet in the same system for an emergency refueling many centuries ago, before the advent of quantum energy extraction. All of this changed when the inhabitants of d1f32, humans, left the solar system in their first light-speed capable ship. 

As is the case with any civilization which obtains light-speed capabilities, we sent a team to intercept. Fortunately the humans had developed no defensive technology, and the sole occupant, along with his craft, were detained without risk. Unfortunately for the human, our policies, drafted by hard experience, necessitated a period of enhanced interrogation to determine the species motives. 

As we had seen dozens of times, the subject on our monitor ""awoke"" with a jolt. No, he wasn't fully conscious, that would be cruel, but rather, in a state semi-consciousness where his intentions would be easiest to read. Now to apply the heated DHM. 

When the jets of DHM struck the human, several us cringed. None of us had experienced this technique firsthand, but we had all seen it used as a punishment on our own kind and others, many times. Unlike with other species, the human hardly responded, in fact, he seemed to relax. At first we thought the DHM had killed the individual, but the machines kept reading his neural impulses, concluding that the human was feeling pleasure. 

Purified dihydrogen monoxide was uncomfortable for most species even at the lowest of temperatures; how could this human feel pleasure while streams of steaming DHM were raining down on him? 

We will require further experimentation. ",bhamgeo

There's definitely at least [some science](http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/nutrientschap12.pdf?ua=1) behind it.

&gt; Water
resorption by the intestinal epithelium is also enabled by sodium transport. If distilled water is
ingested, the intestine has to add electrolytes to this water first, taking them from the body
reserves. Since the body never eliminates fluid in form of ""pure"" water but always together with
salts, adequate intake of electrolytes must be ensured. Ingestion of distilled water leads to the
dilution of the electrolytes dissolved in the body water. Inadequate body water redistribution
between compartments may compromise the function of vital organs. Symptoms at the very
beginning of this condition include tiredness, weakness and headache; more severe symptoms are
muscular cramps and impaired heart rate.
 Additional evidence comes from animal experiments and clinical observations in several
countries. Animals given zinc or magnesium dosed in their drinking water had a significantly
higher concentration of these elements in the serum than animals given the same elements in
much higher amounts with food and provided with low-mineral water to drink. Based on the
results of experiments and clinical observations of mineral deficiency in patients whose intestinal
absorption did not need to be taken into account and who received balanced intravenous nutrition
diluted with distilled water, Robbins and Sly (9) presumed that intake of low-mineral water was
responsible for an increased elimination of minerals from the body. ",WellHeresMyFourthAcc

"[WP] What is torture to aliens, is mundane to humans",Pimpin_Slav,"Now I know why we were doomed to be left alone in the universe. It's not that we're so insignificant, that we would never be able to make contact with intelligent extra-terrestrial life. It's just that regardless of whether or not we've made contact, we're hated, by everyone, for simply being us. Because of my experience I now know, most of the universe makes an extra effort, to avoid any hint of detection by our instruments, whenever they chance upon this corner of the Milkyway. Because the few that do land here, often live short lives. I can attest to that for sure, first hand.

It was a few years ago, when I first met an alien. It had crash-landed in its vessel, somewhere out in the forest. And though I was hunting for deer at the time, I saw as it trailed from the sky, so brightly, into the horizon. Then a crash. The first thought that came to my mind was, ""Son of a bitch! There goes the deer for the day."" But my second thoughts onward, convinced me to investigate the crashed meteorite, to salvage it for stuff I could sell to enthusiasts. So fueled with a drive for greed, I ran towards it. What I had found when I finally got there, was a huge crater, still glowing red from the heat of the impact. And what stuck out of it, was, what could only be described as a trashed vehicle, not of this world. But what truly caught my eye and ears, was the banging, coming from within the ship.

 Behind a glass-like window, was a creature, banging on it, moving it's mouth(?) in panic. I was immediately shaken by it, by the appearance of something so foreign, and stepped back to observe at a safer distance. It was at this point that a sound started blipping from the ship, and the creature proceeded to move it's body more frantically, banged on the window more loudly, moved it's mouth more rapidly, and began making these eye movements at me. Intrigued, I kept looking on, in a curious daze.

Eventually I snapped out from my daze, and I looked at it, trying to figure out what it had wanted. Common sense dictated that the ship might be blipping from something dangerous, and so I concluded that the alien wanted to escape. So I picked up the closest rock I could find and chucked it at the window. The rock simply bounced off of it and fell to the ground. The creature then, just stopped in it's panic, and stared at the rock, as it bounced off harmlessly into the crater below. The creature then, just dropped it's body and just moved its eyes, slowly but constantly, between the rock and me. It's as if this creature had just given up, signaling to me how pathetic that was. Annoyed, I pulled out my rifle and pointed the barrel at the window. 

""Don't Mock Me Fool!"" I yelled as I pulled the trigger. 

A second later, the bullet shattered the window, and the creature plopped out. It then made haste to skitter towards me, eager to escape the ship. And after it had moved to me, it just plopped down beside me. We then looked on as the ship exploded. Now then, since this was such a semi-awkard moment, I tried to break the ice by making small talk, with an alien, that I didn't know if it was able to communicate with me or not, or whether or not it was hostile. Eager to find a topic to converse about, I gave the creature a good look to see its form in detail. All-together it was a pink slimy thing. A slimy thing, which was currently in a humanoid shape, sitting down. And besides the loads of jelly(?) tentacles on its head, and a mouth, and fluid moving eyes, it didn't look too intimidating. But it certainly looked foreign.

""So"" I said, ""Do you come around here often?""

But immediately, the creature recoiled, as if physically in pain. 

""Oh no... I'm so sorry."" I said as I neared closer, in sympathy, ""are you hurt anywhere from your, um.. accident?""

But the creature squirmed away again in pain, as if covering its face with it's arms and tentacles, as if blocking its ears.

""Oh no!"" I replied, as I neared closer to it again, ""Do you need a doctor?""

The creature then, suddenly lunged at me, pinning me to the floor. It forced it's hand over my mouth and held me down. 

""HELP!, HELP!"" I yelled reactively, as I squirmed and struggled in a panicked reaction.

But it wouldn't let go as it forced its body to silence me, all the while, also in a pained expression. And so, we struggled, all throughout the night, when finally, we ran out of energy. And we just lied there on the forest floor, exhausted. And then I passed out. 

When I woke up, the alien was dead. The flies were already gathering around its corpse, as it shriveled up, and began drying out. I looked at it with a horrified expression, that it was possibly me who had unknowingly killed it, either by our struggle or something else. 

So I buried it. ",Antedelopean

Not only are they impervious to DHM, the human is capable of excreting DHM through their skin! They excrete it under high temperatures, stress and physical exertion. Physical combat is not advised. This suggests that they have stores of DHM in their bodies. Even their oral cavity and occular sensors are covered with it!

The worst news came from the orbital probes that indicate that the planetary surface is abundant in DHM with landscapes flooded beyond the horizon. Even the atmosphere contains traces of DHM vapour and can gather in a large concentrations to the point of precipitation.

Jefferson gulped. He knew he was about to be subject to some insane torture. Like insects being injected in to his body or lasers shooting holes in his soul. But what they didn't know is that he had a very high tolerance for pain. He wouldn't go out easy. ""Bring it on,"" Jefferson hissed. 

The Alien frowned. ""You brought this upon yourself. Bring the onions!""

""The what?"" Two minature aliens holding onions and vegetable peelers were summoned. They sliced them, right under his eyelids. ""Answer us human, what are you made from?"" Jefferson shook his head, ""never!"" The alien sliced the last piece of onion and then crumpled to the floor in a puddle of its own tears. 

""Summon the fire!"" 

Oh god, Jefferson thought. They were going to burn him alive. Three aliens were summoned this time, the one in the center held a short match and flame. They slowly approached. ""What are you made from!"" 

Jefferson began laughing. 

""Burn him!""instructed Alien 32. They threw the match at him, but it died mid air into a smouldering wick. 

""Vey well, bring two chains!"" 

Jefferson smirked, what the hell were they going to do with two chains? Wrap around and pull at his body.  ""Do your worst,"" he jived.

"[WP] What is torture to aliens, is mundane to humans",Pimpin_Slav,"They looked almost identical to us. I was surprised to meet the ambassador. She was elegant and professional but had a very sarcastic sharp wit about her. I was a liaison chosen to show her around the city. Everyone knew they were here. But amid some tensions they were kept away from the public most times. Since we were so similar, it was easy to pass her off as human. Any differences were covered up by clothes. The main difference though was the extravagant hairstyles they all had. It would put Lady Gaga to shame. She had made a few questioning remarks about our simple styles. I informed her some of us like it simple, but others do prefer a similar style to her own. I figured what better way to have girl time together than to go see a stylist doing some hair. I could use a good cut and maybe even try a new style for a change. I'm sure she would love to watch.

I took her to one of the top stylists in the city. They are bound to be doing something crazy. I opened the door and escorted her inside. Lined around the walls were pictures of some of the most epic hairstyles donned by models in the world. She was elated.

""My word, such vibrancy and variance. Your species has such creativity!"".

If this wouldn't improve relations I don't know what would.

""Want to go see if we can watch?"" I ask

""Fantobu! Oh im sorry, that's our way of saying yes with an ecstatic emphasis.""

I escort her to a stylist who is in the midst of cutting a, by the looks of it, models hair. That is when the ambassador makes a horrifying screech of pure fear and anger. It would have put horror movie flicks to shame. She bolted for the stylist, knocking him to the ground. I began running to stop the scuffle as she lay on the ground swinging her fists wildly. She was calling him all kinds of things that had no translation I know of. I finally grab her off of him

""WHAT ARE YOU DOING!?"" I scream at her, confused to no end.

""ME?! Aren't you going to stop him! He was about to cut her hair!""

Just then the ambassador peered around the shop, noticing all of the other patrons with missing hair that is seen lying dead on the floor. The sharp object in the stylists hands. And everybody seems fine with it.

""Of course he his. Do you people not cut your hair?"" 

It was then I realized all of the people i met from her species had extremely long hair, done up with exotic precision.

""Monsters! Are you crazy!? Who would do that to themselves! The pain would be excrutiating!""

""What are you talking about? We don't feel pain when we cut our hair. How is it possible to feel pain when you cut hair?""

""We have more nerve endings in our hair than almost anywhere on our body. To cut our hair is a penalty worse than death. Only sickos on our planet do something like that!""

Perhaps it is for the best, if I do not know how long I've been here I will not able to contemplate how much longer I am to stay here. 

I am not alone here, I know that. I try to not speak but there are others, others like me, they speak. Whenever they speak. I... I hear screams. Not from the ones who speak. No, only from them who are forced to listen. 

Screams, they are our way to express agony. However, these screams are not ours. Furthermore, they are not human. 

I know what the other prisoners say. They speak only lies. They lie, like everyone else in this world. Some say you lie about 3 times every 10 minutes, but here. Here they lie incessantly. 

I am not phased by lies. Neither are those who jailed me here, or those who tell the lies. I admit, I would lie if they forced me to speak, lying would be my only way of protecting those who I can no longer reach. But at what cost?

A lie, a scream and then another lie followed by a shriek. The cycle is neverending. I do not wish to hurt the innocent but how can I win if the truth hurts my home and the lies hurt the innocent. 

The ones who scream, they are not from our earth. They should not be a part of this fight. Still we humans found them and some saw their potential as a tool. 

Earth can never be a home for them, not when lies inflicts pain and truths are few and far between in this world. Here a lie will protect ourselves but hurt an outsider, however the truth will hurt ourselves but spare the outsider. 

Thus, I will continue to lie. It is in my nature. Humans have evolved this way, to protect home, to protect family. The only things worth lying for.

"[WP] After all his life, an old man finally makes a move.",RlyAProblem,"I've been in love with Cheryl Donnelly  ever since I laid eyes on her 63 years ago. To this day, even though father time has done his number on the both of us, she still remains the most beautiful, graceful woman on this planet. The only problem is I've never spoken one word to her. 

There are a number of reasons for this, I suppose. Mainly, I'm just a chicken shit. Afraid of telling her how I feel. Afraid of rejection. Afraid that she isn't everything my mind has made her out to be. I've been to war, jumped out of a crashing plane.... And for all these years, I'd rather do both again than face the fear of her rejection. 

I've missed out on a lot in life because of this infatuation. No wife, no kids. How could I ever get married when I know in my heart that they couldn't compare to Cheryl? 

So yesterday morning when the doctor told me I only had a few months to live, I thought 'what the hell?' As Andy Dufresne once said, 'Get busy living, or get busy dying.' Might as well do both while I have the time. 

I walked up her front stairs, the same stone stairs I had passed every day on my way to work. It wasn't exactly the fastest route, but I didn't mind the detour if it meant I could see her face. I stood there at her door for what felt like an eternity, my hat clutched tightly in my hands, my heart hammering in my chest. Sixty three years I had thought about this moment. 

I knocked. 

""One second,"" I heard her call. Her voice was that of angels. I could hear the rhythmic thumping of her walker as she made her way to answer. She opened the door and flashed me the warmest smile. I think that gave me the courage. 

""I know this is going to be a bit strange, but I don't have much time. I won't bother you long, I promise."" I paused, and when it became clear she was at least going to hear me, I continued. ""My name is Michael Fredericks. We graduated together from St. Marcus High in 1953, and there is something I've wanted to tell you since I first saw you.""

There it was. Right out in the open. I stood vulnerable before her gaze, relief crashing over me as her smile widened. 

""Alright,"" she said, nudging the door open and making room for me to pass. ""Come on in, I'll make some tea.""",Mojo884ever

[WP] You find a bottle of pills that reset the day.,Royal-Ninja,"I’ve finally figured it out. I’ve been so stupid! Like a child with a new toy I had dived right in and reset my day, using all the knowledge to look clever like you’re supposed to. I just didn’t think. How many times did I read that packet?


""One WHOLE tablet to be taken with water. Do not use more than once in the same 24 hour period.""


But I was young and stupid. It hadn’t even mattered where the pills had actually come from when I’d made the decision to try one, so of course it hadn’t really mattered when about twenty three hours later I ignored the faded warning and took a second dose. It might sound crazy, referring to myself as young when I am not a day older now than I was then, but I have lived through thousands of days since that moment. 

Today, though, is different. Today I’ve figured out how to break the loop.

Being trapped in an endless loop, forced to live out a paradox for thousands of days on end, over and over, it has a certain effect on the mind. I often wondered how this could be happening; as the day restarted, so should my brain. Yet my memories and emotions remained. Anything I wrote down or conveyed or posted to the Internet disappeared along with the day, except my thoughts. At first I began to learn as much as I could, convinced this might be an opportunity to grow my knowledge and wisdom.

As the days passed, questions burned within me. Had I   been separated from the universe’s timeline or was it stuck with me in my infinite loop? Had I stopped the advancement of all time? Or had my perception of it just changed? Had I just singlehandedly broken the universe by taking two pills in one day?

I’d tried all of the obvious methods to break the loop, destroying the pill, attempting suicide like Bill Murray in that film, finding supposed experts online, one time I’d even spent days conjuring an elaborate plan to steal a military helicopter and destroy the site of my great grandfather’s laboratory where I’d found the pills. Quite a lot of people died that day. Myself included.

Until a few days ago, I’d finally resigned myself to an eternity of waking up to the traffic outside my window, Adele on the radio, turning the pumps on my boiler to get enough pressure for a shower, not having any coffee in the house. It wasn’t such a bad existence, not that much more monotonous than my usual life had been beforehand. At least this way I knew I would never get ill or frail, never lose anyone close to me, never have to feel that pain of loss.

But today is different. I’ve figured out how to break the loop. It’s all so simple and it’s right there on the packet. I just need to take half a pill. I think I always knew how to do it deep down, but I have to admit that knowing that your day is going to reset is actually quite the thrill, I cannot deny enjoying it. You can try anything. In any number of ways.

I’ve seen a lot of the women in the immediate vicinity naked, for example. Many of us have slept together. Some consentingly. I have murdered countless people in countless creative and beautiful ways. I’ve made quite the art of it. I haven’t even started on my plans for the school yet.

You see, today is different because now I can do what I want for as long as I want, and I can break it whenever I like. That power lies in my hands, the power to make any day of my own creation into a reality. I have plenty of pills to find new days later on, to start new loops, with new groups of subjects to play with. 

For now though, I will be remaining here, in this day. 

Let me be their God a little longer.",Nw5gooner

[WP] You find a bottle of pills that reset the day.,Royal-Ninja,"The morning grind, others see it as this boring thing, but not I. Exercise, eat, study, prepare for work. These actions give me purpose. Gives me something to do with my time. The lack of purpose drags nails on the chalkboard of my mind. So I make sure each waking moment has a purpose. 

It has been ever since my roommate gave me these pills. Thirty in total. “Thirty days,” he said. “Take these pills to find your purpose in thirty days.”

In hindsight I should’ve told the guy to fuck off. But he’s a doctor, he knows what he’s doing, right? Well like Alice, I went down a rabbit hole. It was beautiful, it was brilliant.

“John wake up.” My roommate shook me. 

“Ughhhhhh.” I groaned into my pillow. “Five more minutes.” 

He pulled off the covers. Hello cold morning breeze. “You said that a hour ago. Wake up, you have to be at work in a half-hour.” 

Eyes closed, hands fumbling, no cover. Shit.

“They’re in my hands.” Dammit. I opened my eyes, sighing in defeat. 

“Fine. I’ll get up.” Asshole. I sighed. Not my day. It never is, the words seeped into my mind. Why did I even bother. It’s not like anyone cared. 

“Good. Get dressed. Sitting around like this isn’t good for your health.” He tossed me a clean black shirt and beige dress pants. Took me five minutes of Ryan watching me like a hawk to get dressed. “You ready?”

“Yeah…” I rubbed my eyes a good ten times. On my attempt to walk out, I hit the wall. He snorted. 

“Tell you what, I have some nice supplements that’ll give you an extra push.” He handed me a bottle of clear white pills. 

“I’m not self-medicating Ryan.” I shook my head.

“I’ll write you a damn prescription if it makes you happy.” He pulled out a medical card and filled it out. “There. Now take the damn supplements. You need the energy.” 

I stared at him. I stared at the pills. Unscrewing them, grabbing one, and swallowing it. The moment I feel it hit my stomach a flash of light hits my eyes. I’m back in bed. 
“John wake up.” My roommate shook me.

“What the…” I looked around in bewilderment. “You… What?”

“You okay buddy?” Ryan touches my forehead with the back of his hand. 

“You gave me a pill… Said it was for energy. Was I dreaming?” I frowned.

“Oh. So I got around to giving it to you then. Welcome to the Regen Cycle Program. You are our first successful attempt.”

I was purposely hunched over, seeing that my face and rips were broken and bruised. With my hands tied roughly behind my back, I was unable to wipe the blood slowly dripping down my nose and onto the floor.

The door in front of me flew open with a bang, and in walked in Detective Samuels. He caught my glance of hate and smirked at me. ""Jesus David, you look like shit.""

""Thanks, you bastard."" I spat some blood out of my mouth as I said this.

""Oh don't be like that"", Samuels said condescendingly, squatting down in front of me. ""At least they didn't shoot ya. That's thanks to me, by the way.""

""Awesome."" I was having a hard time speaking around my cut mouth. ""Peachy.""

Samuels laughed at that, and slapped my knee with a handgun chummy-like. ""Always a jokester, David."" He stood up and walked away from me, then turned back to me. ""By the way, don't think your 'special power' is gonna save you. They know about it. I told them.""

My eyes shot up to him. *He knew...?*

He smiled at my reaction. ""Yeah, your ability to make people misunderstand you? Yeah. They know about it. Like it can do you any good. I figured they should know about it at least, told them they should just put a cap in your knee if you start pulling that gibberish on them.""

He turned back towards the door, saying as he left ""I was damned funny though, having people at bars and such all thinking you were saying different things to each of them. Hope you get one last laugh out of them before they get the location of the USB out of your skull.""

He had just reached the door and was reaching out to the handle before wretching over, vomiting blood all over the door and his shoes. I could see him shudder as he realized he couldn't breath. He tried to stand up straight but coughed again and fell over on his side, facing me. His eyes grew wide as he saw me standing next to the chair completely unhurt and untied.

I walked over to him and picked up his gun. His eyes were puffed up and red, blood still trickling out of his gasping mouth and broken nose. I squatted down next to him, and gave him a jovial slap on the cheek.

""Oh Samuels, you were so fucking wrong about me. Yeah, everything thinks my power is lame--but that's because everyone is wrong about my power. I make people misunderstand *themselves*, not just me. I got to watch you beat the ever-loving shit out of yourself with that crowbar, thinking it was me."" I flipped the safety on the gun. ""I was gonna shoot ya, but watching you choke to death on punctured lungs and blood filling your stomach is actually way better. You killed my wife you son of a bitch, and this is my way of repayment.""

I sat back, keeping my eyes locked on Samuels as he tried to speak around a broken mouth. His breathing was already getting labored, and he wretched again as more blood poured out of his mouth. It splattered on my shoes, and I immediately put the gun to his head and pulled the trigger in that same instant. *Mother fucker actually ruined my goddamn shoes*

I stood up, annoyed with myself, gave myself a brief brush off and walked over Samuel's dead body and out the door. The thug standing outside greeted me. ""Ay, Detective Samuels, everything go alright in there?""

I straighten my tie and smile at him. ""Oh its just fine. Detective David Sommers is just passed out in there, I'd leave him be for the time being.""

As the thug nodded at me, I turned and walked towards the exit. I pulled out my phone, and punched in the number. ""Investigator David Sommers, reporting file #M0975 completed.

""Only a few days.""

The woman nods. ""Margaret, you have the ability to spoil meat without even touching it.""

Maggie's mouth hangs open. ""I...what?""

""E. Coli. Salmonella. Rotavirus. Your mere presence causes massive bacterial contamination of nearby meats.""

""There's no other way to put it,"" says the man. ""You are a walking, talking, breathing food poisoning machine. And we want you to come work for us.""

Maggie shakes her head. ""That doesn't make any sense."" The room seems to be spinning. The lightbulb moves faster and faster.

""Of course we'll never ask you poison regular civilians,"" says the woman. ""Visiting foreign dignitaries, perhaps. Professional athletes. Cultists. Your powers will be used to restore balance to the world.""

[WP] You have a power. Everyone thinks this power is completely lame. They are wrong.,SleepyLoner,"Before the accident, being a teacher was awful. Low wages, shitty kids, a principal that refused to stop staring at my rack. I had considered quitting, I had even fantasized about burning down the school. It was a nightmare. And worst of all I had to buy my own goddamn chalk. What bullshit! All I wanted to do was help change a few lives and here I am praying for some free chalk. 

Thankfully, all that changed in a heartbeat. In a classically tragic car crash involving me, some local sewage, and an overfull truck of taffy out for delivery. The irony of course is I was hankering for something sweet after a long day of work. I just didn't expect when I got my sweets, it would lead me to a couple of hospitals and a small, local government testing facility. 

A fuck ton of science experiments later and I was feeling back to my normal self. I was warned that the combination of sewage waste and taffy DNA, and drugs used to save my life, I would rebound from this experience with some sort of Mr. Fantastic-esque powers and to keep a low-profile. I had no plans on being a super anything and my powers had yet to show so I brushed this off. 

Returning to work the next day, I found out the true power that hid beneath this vessel of knowledge. Returning after a couple of weeks to find a piece of chalk the size of a tic tac is no warm welcome. That is, unless you have my abilities. One touch of the chalk mixed with my bubbling anger and BOOM, it grew back to its normal size. 

To any normal person this would seem an unimpressive skill. I thought as much too, as did the rest of the nation when I appeared on America's Got Talent. Turns out they were all wrong. I had drank loads of coffee to prepare for my audition and as soon as I was boo'd off the stage (and soon it was), I raced for the bathroom to cry and pee. With so many fluids rushing from my body I failed to realize that the toilet paper roll was nearly empty. 

I checked around the toilet bowl itself to see if any more would present itself but there was none there. I was humiliated one time tonight I refused to let it happen a second time. I reached out a hopeful hand towards the remaining roll and, low and behold, it restored itself completely to full strength. 

I'm sure a good many of you are doubting the power I hold but I promise you, with these abilities lives can be saved. And embarrassing toilet paper incidents can be resolved.",filmNjunk

[WP] You have a power. Everyone thinks this power is completely lame. They are wrong.,SleepyLoner,"Everyone used to laugh at me when I first obtained my powers. Granted, not everyone in the world had them but one day, a number of children born after the year 2000 started developing them when they reached 12. So that made me a special in a sense since there were roughly over a thousand of us powered teens by the time I acquired mine. Of course, special being relative because no one believed me at first when I told them; not even Mom or Dad. 

The fact was, I had the ability to unravel knots easily; don't balk. I first discovered this when I'd accidentally mixed up my headphone cables with my mouse's and keyboard's. It took me less than a second to pull them apart. Before, I'd likely have had to sacrifice at least one of them by cutting a cable loose. Now, I could easily crush constrictor and butterfly knots with one hand and blindfolded.

It was my P.E teacher who had been so impressed when I saved his neck for having jumbled up all the homecoming curtains that made the call to the U.N. for me that got me sent to Geneva for the Powered and Enhanced Assessment Tests. Fortunately, I passed with flying colors and the Secretary General announced their discovery to the rest of the world live on public television.

That was a year ago and what a change it's been. I was sent to the super powered persons training academy that had been set up on this secret island somewhere in the Pacific. There, I would be trained to hone in on my gift so that it could be used to do some greater good for the rest of mankind.  More on this later.

The fact was, not everyone used their super powers responsibly and neither were the U.N. the only organization around that was recruiting. Several terrorists organizations and even some of the corporations realized the golden opportunity to have their own squad of supers working for them. The fact that most of us started out at the ripe age of 12 meant it was easy to mold us into their perfect tool.

Well, anyway, we were all assigned to teams where they felt we'd fit best. I was naturally assigned to Search and Rescue since I could easily untie ropes and chains. It felt great at first, being a part of something until I realized almost everyone on the team had pretty crummy powers, mine included. There's a kid called Ryan who could turn partially transparent but not completely invisible, and Joy who could generate just enough heat from her hands to boil an egg but not so much when it came to field work. There was Ling who could siphon electricity from her surroundings and release it in the form of an EMP so that was pretty neat, but she was wheel chair bound. 

We were all misfits and in the months where we trained, they would pick individuals from our team for specific missions. The most action I'd seen was when Team Beta sent for my services to help untie all their balloons after a celebratory party for capturing a small outfit of terrorist supers. They gave me some leftover cheese cake so I guess it was still something.

My big break did come this one day, exactly a year after I'd gotten my powers, they announced Code Black. Up till then, I'd seen my share of Code Yellows, Oranges and even Red once, but never a Black. Something big had gone down and there was an emergency broadcast on television but we never got to hear it because the announcement was cut short. Something blew up the camera crew, along with the Secretary General and the rest of the U.N. delegates. All we could see was the hall ablaze with smoldering pillars falling from above. Shit had really hit the fan.

All of Search and Rescue had been picked except for me. There was an invasion, someone had said, and it wasn't from this planet. It turns out that the reason we received our powers was due to some intergalactic race had decided to draft Earthlings into some galactic war and failed to inform us about this. The reason was because their agent had been blown up before it could complete its mission this side of the Milky Way by what appears to be the adversary's forces.

Earth's only hope; its only army were a bunch of teenagers with enhanced powers. There were thousands of us of course, but nearly a billion of their ships for as far as we could tell. It wasn't a battle we could win.

In the first wave alone, we lost Alpha, Beta, Kappa and Gamma team and those teams housed our powerhouses. The ones who could fly at least. Fortunately Delta Team consisted of several morphs that turned into flying creatures leading some of our hitters in the air. Team Epsilon that consisted of all the brainiacs reworked some of the unlaunched shuttles from NASA for orbital flight and had a battalion of several teams shot into the atmosphere for war. 

I along with the rest of the supers who could not contribute were distributed along the globe to assist in other ways, such as evacuations and ferrying supplies and medicines to the parts of the world that were hit hardest. The battle was intense and every moment felt like my last. I was on board a jetliner and we were nearly hit by one of the adversary's ships had it not been for one of the Omicron guys who leaped in the way and shielded our plane.

At some point, I heard that even the terrorists and corporations were chipping in. One of them, Al-Qaeda I think, were planning to send some special biological nuke they had been cooking up into the alien mothership and were calling for any surviving supers to help out.

I managed to get in contact with them but the guy on the line simply laughed when he heard my name. What could I do? Untie their shoelaces? They needed a superpower that could end the war, not someone that could unravel stuff. He proceeded to called me something derogatory and told me to stick to whatever I was doing and not get killed in the process. Well, I sure showed him soon enough.

I was in the Philippines at the time and by a stroke of luck, so were my old team consisting of Ryan and Joy who were lying in stretchers at the tent where I made the call from. Ling, I soon learned from my teammates, had been among the envoys sent to convince the Al-Qaeda into helping so she was probably among the supers who would be headed to space.

For whatever reason, an incredible idea seemed to unfold in my mind. I'd always had an inkling about the limits of my powers that I'd never formally tested; except for the time when I attempted to solve a complex sudoku puzzle. I figured that in theory, this would be the same thing but I needed a starting point and Ryan would have been the perfect specimen. 

I explained this to him and he agreed, so he turned himself semi transparent but kept his organs visible. This was something I had seen him do during training so I knew at least that was possible. Then came the hardest part. How my powers worked was that I had to focus on the subject matter that I wanted to unravel. It usually worked instantly but those were merely strings or cables. This time, I was staring right at a person's brain.

I don't recall for how long I'd been staring at it but it was Ryan who had awoken me. Firstly, he pointed out that I was bleeding from the nose and it was getting all over his face and secondly, the Al-Qaeda's plan had failed. They sent seven shuttles carrying possibly the last of Earth's fighting force headed for the mothership, and only two barely made it past their defenses. The one carrying the bionuke had been captured while signal from the other had been lost. I knew I had little time.

Thanking Ryan and turning towards Joy, I asked her to close her eyes and relax whilst I placed both hands on her head. She was livid at first but after calming down and hearing my plan, she relented. I had told her to concentrate her powers so it would flow into my hands. She did so and I closed my eyes as well.

In theory, I knew my powers allowed me to ""figure stuff out"" in an instant. This was only seemingly applied to strings most because I had the most trouble sorting out my cables and ever since I'd discovered my powers; the only thing I'd ever used them on were knots and cables. It was the one sudoku puzzle that Ling challenged me many months ago that I recalled what must have been my powers activating and allowing me to solve just in time to beat Ling's. I hadn't realized this then, but somehow I knew it now. If I could unravel a knot by just thinking it, I could unravel anything and I'd just done that by understanding the human brain. This all was hypothetical, assuming that Ryan's brain was a complete functioning one.

Fortunately, it was enough to understand how his powers were used as well and to the effect of being able to reproduce that on another person's body. Part of Joy's forehead began to turn translucent much to Ryan's surprise. As Joy channeled her heat into me, the part of my brain that figured things out basically broke down her powers into simple maths that I realized I could not only work with but modify its properties turning heat into static electricity. It started with a spark that flitted from my head touching Ryan's hand. He gasped but the blip was gone and jumped into the next nearest person. In that brief moment, I could read all of his thoughts and transmit some of mine into every person that it touched. Short to say, I'd made contact with almost everyone alive our side of the planet within the hour.

[WP] You have a power. Everyone thinks this power is completely lame. They are wrong.,SleepyLoner,"This is my first time writing for a prompt, so any criticism/critique is welcome.

Edit: Some grammatical corrections.
_______________________________
You can typically imagine a person's opinion on their ability, and by some extension the type of person they are, by what they call it. Some call it ""superpower"", some call it ""blessing"", some call it ""curse"". I prefer to call by ability a ""quirk"", because it's a rather quirky ability.

My ability works in two ways: with simply a thought, I can lock things, and I can unlock things.

Most people will laugh at the idea that my quirk is just ""lock &amp; unlock"". Like any person with an ability, they'll ask me to prove it, usually dragging me to the nearest door to show it off. Many pass it off as some utility use of telekinesis or some other kineticist ability, but it simply doesn't work like that.

Some pass it off as a useless ability, but I disagree. Quite the contrary, it's a rather useful quirk on the day-to-day basis. I never have to worry about losing my keys, considering I can lock the door behind me with a thought and unlock it when I get back. It does get rather annoying, though, when a neighbor finds out about this quirk and immediately turns to you when they're too absentminded to remember where their keys are or too lazy or over-encumbered to use them. Either that, or they want to show off my quirk to their friends like a dog trained to perform a funny trick. But it's more than some trick.

A lot of people tells me that my power is useless outside of that utility. That's just not the case, as I myself found a few months back. Here's why.

A few months ago, I was at the local convenience store, perusing through the chips. As I debated over Cool Ranch vs Nacho Cheese, a commotion broke out at the register. Two thugs were holding up the cashier and threatening them to empty the register. One had a handgun, waving it around in the direction of the cashier, while the other generated a flame in his hand. Overkill maybe, but it was certainly a threatening display.

Before I could think, the man with the gun turned and saw me. I guess they'd planned a run in and run out sort of robbery and hadn't thought about any witnesses. In the heat of the moment, he turned his handgun in my direction and fired. I winced and moved my arms in some vain attempt to block the bullets somehow. In that split second, my life flashed before my eyes. A cascade of thoughts and images flooded my mind from the day I was born to that very instant. At the end, only one thought remained.

*Lock*

That was my go-to thought, a sort of command, when I used my locking quirk. Not very inventive, I know.

I stood there, blocking the shot for what felt an eternity. I expected a sudden blackness as I fell dead, or at least some pain, but it didn't come. When I looked up, I saw the bullets just hanging in the air, inches from my face. I thought that some unseen hero came along and stopped them in midair. The thug panicked, shouting to his buddy to help him out. He must have figured I was a telekineticist holding the bullets in the air, so maybe I was limited to grabbing solid matter and not fire. His buddy responded by turning and tossing his fireball at me. As if by some impulse, the thought came to my mind again.

*Lock*

The fireball stopped in midair, seemingly frozen in time. The thugs panicked and made a run for the door.

*Lock*

They stopped as if frozen in time themselves. The cashier stood there for a moment in awe before calling the police. While waiting for them, I had time to think about what happened, and an idea came to my head. To double check, I unlocked the bullets and the fireball. They flew through the air as if they had never been stopped. They certainly would have killed me if it hadn't been for my quirk. Once the police arrived, I unlocked the thugs, who ran right into the arms of the cops.

That day was the day I made a realization about my quirk. I had been so used to one definition of ""locking"", with the locks on doors, windows, boxes, cars, etc. that I never tried locking or unlocking anything else. My quirk seemed to work on some metaphysical level, where anything can be locked or unlocked beyond the conventional definition I had been accustomed to. In the months since that day, I found a number of other applications through a number of tests on friends and acquaintances.

I can lock things into a position, bending, maybe even defying, the most conventional laws of motion. I can lock a person's superpower/blessing/curse/whatever and render them powerless unless I unlock their ability. I can unlock the hidden potential in people, allowing them to use abilities, human or superhuman, that they never knew they had or rendering them more powerful. I can also lock a person's capabilities, rendering smart men into simpletons, athletes into weaklings, verbose men into mutes, etc.. If it involved locking it and unlocking it, I can do it.

I'm still not fully aware of my limits, but it may not really matter. Even if I hit the limit, I may just have to unlock the limit and go beyond. Why worry about the opening and closing doors of opportunity when you have a quirk to unlock them all?",OtakuSoze

Well it so happens that that's wrong. You see, I violate the laws of thermodynamics, and as such, the scientific community is pretty interested in me.

What do I use my powers for you might ask? Well I guess it helps my body temperature to stay constant, meaning I never really get cold. I can survive just fine out in the winter, if there's a blizzard I can go out in t-shirt. In theory anyway, I still feel cold, I just don't get affected by it.

For some more mundane tasks I keep my pizza warm at all times, which unfortunately makes me the designated busboy. I work at a local pizza place, but I'm not bad off with money like the average student, if you think that. Nah, I just like working there because of this cute girl. 
The reason I'm well off is due to the scientists, they gave me money to take samples. Despite the thanks I got from these people, most people I know think I'm a good for nothing dork.

""Watch,"" I told them. ""It'll do it, just wait.""

I slowly raised my hand palm-up in front of me. My small audience passed all kinds of looks, mainly the sort that say, ""this man is not sane."" Yet they remain observing patiently.

A few moments passed, and the worm was yet to do much more than wiggle. I was losing viewers at this point, but I didn't care. It was happening now, I could feel it.

Slowly that little worm began to raise - what I assumed was - its head, and stand on end. The small group of people around me immediately dispersed. ""Worm-charming, dude... are you for real?""

They had no idea what was taking place beneath their feet.

No one would witness what was about to happen but I didn't care. With both hands raised now, I could feel a familiar buzzing in the bottoms of my feet, and through the dry earth popped the head of a second worm. And a third. And a fourth. Within minutes, hundreds surrounded me - then thousands. I threw my hands over my head and the worms bound together, into a single large writhing body. It lowered it's head and atop I climbed, as more continue to rise and join the growing beast below me. I then allowed them to overtake me, and I was soon covered, head-to-toe. I stretched my arms out to my sides and at once the worms on my body perished, leaving a thick, hard, leather-like covering. It didn't take long for the crowd to regain interest - good news for me. There they stood, mouths agape like turkeys in the rain, stiller than the cold inside a refrigerator - full of meaty sustenance.

Until one day I noticed that when I snap my fingers I can make a marble appear where ever I want it. As silly as this sounds I have avoided using my gun multiple times by just this ability. Being a police officer in cocaine driven Miami makes for some gruesome bloodbaths. Just last week an entire precinct got gunned down by an ice cream truck full of columbian smugglers. It gives just about any officer the incentive to switch sides and work for Mr.Escobar or any of the other cartels trying to run their product thru here. Today I go back to work after being in the hospital for two nights because I got grazed by a bullet on my right arm. This will probably the smallest scar I earned this year. 
I woke up with my pain medication still in full effect but that didn't stop me from heating up my day old coffee and getting in my car. I drove down the street when I saw the guy that grazed my arm pulled up in a brown Harley Davidson two cars in front of me. I usually don't take justice in to my own hands and let the thuroughly thought out court system do its job. But I know I would be asking for to much from to not have to chase him down with bullets flying everywhere.

[WP] You have a power. Everyone thinks this power is completely lame. They are wrong.,SleepyLoner,"I remember when my powers first manifested, at age six, though no one else probably does.  I was on the playground, during recess at normal kid school, drinking my juicebox.  I loved juice, at that age, and I sucked that box dry, the box folded in on itself as the air left it.  I wanted more, another box, but kids only got one box.  But then, it was full of juice again.  I drank that one too, and then it filled again.  Again and again, I kept going, so excited and high on sugar, until the anti-climactic moment when I puked on teacher's shoes.  I didn't tell them though, about my power, I knew I'd get in trouble.  They just assumed I had gotten into the juiceboxes somewhere and had my folks come pick me up.  

My father was a drinker.  He didn't like having to leave the bar so early, it was only half past noon.  I still remember that night, the worst beating of my life.  He beat me for interrupting his drinking, then he beat me for crying from my beating, and then he beat me some more because I couldn't go to sleep after my two beatings.  I hated my father.  Not just for the reasons above, but he took his rage out on my mother as well.  It wasn't until much later, after his funeral, that I learned of the brother I would never know, the result my mother's forced abortion at the end of my father's belt.

We were poor.  Mother worked different jobs, the laundromat, the taxi service, she even cleaned people's houses.  Father drank, I don't know how he kept up his drinking, I suspect he actually had my powers too, but never thought to use them creatively.  I trained myself, studied self-discipline,, and after years of practice, I could fill glasses and cups and even plates with the food that they had on them previously.  I even picked out a codename:  The Filler.  But I always kept my powers a secret, I didn't want to have to register with the superheroes, I couldn't fight with these powers, not really.  

I remember the first time I tried to affect a living creature.  My father had just got done beating my mother in the kitchen, apparently it was not acceptable that a woman who cleans houses for a living would have such a dirty kitchen.  I knew he'd probably come after me next.  I didn't want a beating that day, I wasn't going to be beaten ever again.  I grabbed him from behind and I focused my mind, trying to fill his body with water.  It seemed the most logical choice, given how much water we already are.  But it didn't work.  He beat me so hard that I blacked out, and children's services found me the next day.  He was gone, and my mother dead.

You would think this would be a good thing, after the grief of my mother, I was adopted into a family of heroes, they had great powers, strength, flight, laser eyes.  The hospital had found my genetic structure had changed and I was forced to reveal my power to them, and I had to register.  The Filler, an officially registered hero.  I went to the school for supers after that.  Most kids are fine, but the legacies, the children of established superheroes, the ones with the best powers, they often made fun of me for my lame powers.  People would burst into my classes with empty bottles and glasses, insisting that I fill them, for ""The fate of the world depends on it!"".  Everyone had a laugh.  Every time, except me.  Even the teachers would get in on it.  I did my time there, I graduated from Super High School, but I lacked the funding for a traditional college, and I didn’t qualify for the free super college, my powers were rated “D” level.  No one expected much of me.

I took to the streets after high school.  I took my first job that summer, working as one of those Snowcone vendors.  I could refill my own cone as many times as I wanted in the day.  What a perk.  I lived out of an abandoned warehouse, where I practiced my power, I eventually lived off the same bowl of ramen and the same jug of water, as my finances grew, I had different flavors of ramen, different bowls for variety that I filled with my powers.  I moved into a van.  It was awful, but it was shelter and it was mine, and it never ran out of gas.  Eventually, I learned to manipulate and refill more difficult objects.  I liberated an old quarters machine from a now defunct arcade.  I trained on that machine for weeks, and finally, it started to spew quarters.  

I spent my days rolling quarters after that, hours I’d spend doing it, taking them into the bank and depositing them.  I got an account with one of those shifty banks that carters to the poor, so that no one would ask questions, because they gouged me with fees.  But that was fine, it helped convert my money to paper and gave me credibility.  I eventually stole an ATM machine, and started to do the same.  I bought the warehouse, and started to buy up different vending machines, and I lived that way for the longest time.  I even imported one from france, that sold pre packaged steaks and sausages.  

Without having to work anymore, I devoted myself to learning and training.  I spent days in the gym, learning boxing and martial arts. I spent my nights at the private ranges, learning the art of shooting handguns.  At home, I practiced knife work.  I used this chance to make sure no one would ever suffer at the hands of my father again.  It took some doing, avoiding the superhero community as I trained on muggers and robbers, the low crimes that the most powerful heroes didn’t pay any mind.  I filled the bowls of the beggars, I filled their cups with coins and on the street, I was loved.  But I always had to run away, stealth and the shadows were my friends.  I feared retribution for my methods, but I also feared that one of the more powerful heroes might just snuff me out for making them look bad.

I found my father, finally, through my new friends on the streets.  Two shots into the head.  It was not as satisfying as I hoped.  I returned to my city, and started to volunteer at a soup kitchen.  We never ran out of food for the hungry.  No one suspected that I was really the formerly d-list hero, the Filler!  It gave me ears on the street, but also awakened me to the real problems.  Poverty, drug abuse, and I knew that my powers alone could not fix them.

I took a train out to California, and spent all my money to buy some land.  Completely worthless land, it used to have oil wells, but they had since run dry.  An absolutely terrible investment.  Except all an oil well was, to me, the Filler, was a very big juicebox that didn’t taste very good.  I didn’t need to roll quarters after that.

Years later, an anonymous donation came in to the Super High School, in the form of a certified check for one million dollars.  Signed, The Filler.

Edit:  Thanks for all the feedback folks, I really appreciate it.  Since there was some talk about it, and I didn't really explain it well, my idea was that he has to be in physical contact with the object to fill it, and he can't interact with living creatures, which is why he fails to kill his father.  He can however, duplicate the remains of dead creatures, as is evidenced by his ability to replicate food.  I wanted his power to still remain lame, instead of giving the ability to like, fill people's bodies with water and drown them or fill them with sand or whatever.  He also can't refill things that technological in nature, so he can't just ""Fill"" his bank account up with money.  But I think the idea of Epwydadlan1 to fill a vat with blood would totally work for how I imagined his powers, at least once he gets toward the end.  Another limitation is that he has to have an understanding of the thing he's filling, that's why he can do foods and things at first, because I figure his body has a pretty good idea what Juice and Ramen are like, given that he consumes them.  But he wouldn't be able to do something like ""Fill"" someone's blood with the right white blood cells or anything overly complicated like that.  ",BTLOTM

“Let me get this straight, you can move really, really slowly?”

“Shhh,” I glanced sideways at the old couple who sat by our side, the man pushed his glasses further up his nose, “you never know who’s listening.""

“Wait - is that why you’re always late?” She hit her fist against the table.

“No! It’s a superpower, the Flash isn’t always moving at super speed,” I swirled the pasta around in my bowl.

“So, you’re not always really slow, only when you want to be? Like when you’re coming out to meet me for dinner?” She bit her bottom lip, trying to hide the smile that had already reached her eyes.

“I knew you wouldn’t understand,” I stood up, tugging at my coat.

“Babe,” she grabbed my hand, “Sit down, I’m only joking,  lets talk about it.”

“No, I’m done with this.”

I spun around, pulling hard on the sleeve of my coat. It caught on the back of the chair, jerking me backwards. I slipped, extremely slowly.

----

The power to control toasters - sounds stupid, right? Yes. Yes it is. It is a terribly stupid power. I can make them work without power, and I can make them move with telekinesis, but that's about it. It isn't even that strong of telekinesis.

Here's the thing, while your standard toaster may not be much, my custom toasters work just fine. See, as long as a machine has the ability to toast bread, I can control and empower it. The key here is that ""machine,"" ""toast,"" and ""bread"" are all up to interpretation.

For instance, a giant robot with a toaster bolted onto it and tied into its minimal circuitry is just a very fancy toaster. Similarly, I can make toast with flamethrowers, so I can control them just as easily. Plus, if I define ""toasting"" as ""shooting incendiary/explosive ammunition,"" and declare that I will name all demons ""Bread,"" just about every firearm and missile falls under my control.

And, for shits and giggles, my power also makes it so that anyone with any sort of drink at all can make a toast to the invading, newly named Loaf of Bread, I can power them as well. All those toasters are strengthened by my magic, and can fight without food, water, or sleep for as long as the want.

So is control of toasters a stupid power? Only if you use stupid toasters.",wille179

""Let me see it"" Stephanie asked Mike, our friend sitting across the cafe table.

""Here? It might cause an issue"" 

""Oh come on, just don't go all crazy and make it small. i'm sure you wont get into trouble""

""Fine.""

Mike focused intently on the center of the table using his hands as a spotter. Spotting is having to use your hands to control your power, or rather, have better control. When you get really good with it you don't need to use hands unless you really want to let loose.

After a moment the napkins on the table began to flutter. Suddenly they twirled into a vortex as a miniature tornado appeared. As my plastic cup flung into the air Mike ceased his power over mother nature and everything fell to the ground. You could see the people around the cafe whispering to each other. It's rare to meet someone with a power, even moreso to see one use it in public.

Stephanie claps ""Haha that is so cool. I wish mine was that awesome. Having acidic saliva is not something you can show off or have any real use for""

""It comes from that venomous tongue of yours"" I laugh.

""Shut it. You have no room to talk, you still havent shown us yours.""

""Because it's lame. I wish I didn't have it because it's useless.""

""Pleaseeeeee. Just once and I will never ask again"" Stephanie begged.

""Ugh fine, but dont say I didn't warn you. Just watch my eyes closely"".

I look at Stephanie and remove my glasses. She stares at my eyes as I begin to blink. Again, then again, increasingly quickly. At first the blinks are slow enough that the human eye can see it until I pick up the pace so fast it seems like I am no longer blinking.

""You can't see it but i'm still blinking, just so fast you can't tell anymore"".

With that I stop, closing my eyes, and place my glasses back on and sit back.

""Thats it? You blink really fast?""

""Yup, that's it. Now you see why it's lame.""

Stephanie and Mike sat silent for a moment until Mike spoke up

""Has it been useful for anything? I mean, I can't figure out what but it's gotta be useful for something""

""Nope, I dont bother. It's nothing more than a party trick and a lame one at that.""

""Sorry about your luck"" Stephanie says.

I shrug. We finish our drinks and bagels and I excuse myself. I let them know ill give them a call to catch up later.

I walk outside and head home. I stop to sit on a bench at the park on the way to my house. Showing them my powers had made me depressed. Not because they are lame. Far from it. But because of what I had done. This world is not the same. Not the one I knew. I didn't know what my power was when they had began to grow. At first, it was just very quick blinking. But then it turned into something else.

I took off my glasses and began to use my powers. This time, using my hands for spotting. I focused on the movements, and the feeling. Faster and faster my eyes began to blink. Blinking faster than anything man made until the world around me dissolved into it's most basic elements. I could see everything. From the tiniest atom, to the timeline itself. I look at it sometimes. It's so vast and unforgiving. Why give me this power without the knowledge to use it? I lost everything that I held dear. I didn't know what I was doing when it first happened. So I started manipulating it. Removing a single atom proved to be catastrophic. Just, tinkering. I didn't understand the scope of what I had done until I let go and came back to reality. Everything had changed. My parents were dead. My wife and child gone or non existant. Governments were gone or changed, presidents, natural disasters, wars, even countries. History itself. The world was so foreign to me I had to learn everything all over. No matter what I did, I could never get it back to the way it was. I kept trying to fix it. Everytime changing it so vastly, either for good or bad. Until I decided to stop.

But that wasn't enough. I had to reach to space and the conduit was a lot harder since there were fewer people in the air than on the ground. At some point, the burst of static I'd sent jumped into a few of the aliens giving me a chilling view of their mind. They were a hive, controlled by what must be their queen that was housed on their mothership. I couldn't understand the language but they were visual creatures and from what it seemed, the queen too became aware of me as I was aware of it.

Even as I concentrated, I overheard shouts from the crowd that several drones were headed towards the military camp I was in. They were coming by the throngs. So the queen knew what I had in store for it but it didn't realize where the spark was headed. That was reassuring at least, because that was probably the last chance we'd have. I sent a second spark across the globe alerting anyone that could understand English about my plan and the threat of the drones and hoped they'd reach us in time. 

Somewhere in space above our big blue planet, I could sense several heartbeats fading away eternally into slumber. My package jumped across, searching for that one person I hoped would still be alive, at least, alive enough to do one last deed for mankind. 

On Earth, a platoon of low tiered supers had arrived along with a mixed bag of military outfits to confront the drones. Some general gave a rousing speech that raised everyone's morale significantly. None shall pass, I heard him say before he stepped into his chopper and headed for the skies. 

Meanwhile I could sense the queen's desperation as I made the last few jumps off her force's minds. Apart from the assault headed for us, she had recalled her armed forces back into space in search of the hidden threat. 

Down below, metallic ash and brimstone fell from the sky. The soldiers fought valiantly but were brought down very quickly. The super powered teams did what they could but were torn as easily as if they were made of paper. Ryan was asking me to hurry and I could only gaze back into his eyes with sweat pouring down my face.

And then I found her, barely alive. Her spacesuit held, even though she floated aimlessly in space but Ling was still breathing. My package reached her brain and unlocked its payload; a set of instructions that would not only unlock the power in Ling's mind but transform it into something more destructive than ever thought possible. The decision to do so, however, I'd left with Ling and all she had to do with think, ""yes"".

As I severed myself from the connection, I heard the deafening roar of drones moving overhead above our tent. The lights had gone out and apart from the rumbling, everyone had gone silent. This was to be our final moment and in that moment, I too had my doubts.

The explosions never came. For what we waited for a few minutes felt like a lifetime. Slowly, the person closest to the tent's exit stepped outside to bravely take a peek. What happened next was shouting from outside the tent. People started to flock towards the exit. The lights came back on at that moment and the television resumed its broadcasts. A man, who didn't seem like an official caster, was talking on the screen with what appeared to be amateurish looking footage of various parts of the world. The alien ships were simply floating or hovering motionlessly in the skies. Paris, London, New York, the screen continued to switch to different places showing the crafts in stasis.

A lady appeared on the channel whispering to the man who then interrupted the broadcast announcing special footage sent directly from the ISS. The footage was blurry and cut a lot, no doubt from the damage of the initial invasion, but it could not be mistaken. In the middle of the screen, several tiny yellow globes emerged before disappearing into the darkness of space. People crowding around the TV were trying to make out what had happened but I already knew. Looking at Ryan and Joy, the three of us bowed our heads in silence, ode to Ling who used her powers to draw whatsoever electricity in an enormous radius and let loose that power in the form of a nuclear blast a hundred times bigger than the one from Hiroshima. This of course meant that Ling was dead and I was partially responsible for it, but in a sick twisted way, I'd just saved the world.

The woman on the news began to explaining what had happened when suddenly I saw my side profile on the television. I turned to look at a rag tagged crew of journalist with this giant camera pointed at my face. They came at me with questions and questions and before I could even answer, I heard the unmistakable sound of a large missile falling.

Everything went dark for a while.

When I opened my eyes, the ground was burning. The world was burning, as evident from the smoke in the horizon. Several ships flew overhead. In the distance there were people shouting. They sounded more like death throes. Another bomb exploded somewhere far away but dirt fell on my face. That's when I realized I could not feel my hands nor my feet. I could still turn my head and there was no mistaking it, my left arm, or the lower half of it just lay there. I could see my reflection through my watch and it looked like I didn't have much of a face left. The good news was at least one eye had not yet popped out of its socket. 

I felt strangely calm however, as though a renewed sense of peace had claimed me. The world was burning all around me and I was fine with it. I could hear the ticking of the watch and subsequently felt my life slowly ebbing away. I had several questions burning in mind, but at once I understood that my plan had failed. These aliens had a failsafe device that allowed them to negate the effects of time and avoid a killing blow. They weren't in stasis because their queen had been defeated, they had merely stopped existing in time. Now how about that? I should have seen that coming. It'd probably make a great plot for a movie someday, if I ever had the chance to do that one. Instead, all I could think of as I lay there was the empty space above me. Night had fallen over the Philippines and perhaps with most of humanity laid to waste, all I could see was the vastness of space above. It was both humbling and awing to come to terms with the fact that we were just tiny and insignificant and even with mankind gone, space would still exist. In the grand scheme of things, our time here would be but like dust in the wind.

And that's when I figured it out. Or rather, that's when I started to unravel everything around me, above me. It was like a perpetual high that I'd never even experienced since I'd never touched drugs or alcohol. But the feeling was sensational. Space, the universe, all of existence became numbers at my fingertips, if I still had those of course. Fortunately, all I needed was my brain. Was all this preplanned? Was this by some intelligent design? Was I too, a failsafe, for our intergalactic masters that created us or was the discovery of my power's true nature a dry and tragic game of chance?

In my mind, the existential high lasted for centuries, perhaps even eons. In a sense, I understood how time simply did not exist and that all of reality was made up from a bunch of little postcards that were intertwined together in three dimensional space ad infinitum; that time was only perceived to exist because I was observing this. 

But as much as this perpetual high lasted, a part of me, the human part of me still yearned for resolution. There was no way in hell, though only in a manner of speech, that I'd leave the fate of humanity this way. So instead, I did the math and worked it out. I figured a lot of my life had been dull, dreary and more so even tiresome at many points, but it was also reliable and very much dependable. There were no super powers, no aliens and no new age space messiah to confuse all of existence with, and perhaps that would have been for the best.

With a little bit of tinkling, I decided to rewrite history a little. Keep our planet off the grid. Widen the gap between our galaxies and the others. No wars to be had if no one finds each other. Not to mention it'll keep humanity always guessing and always looking to the stars to solve one of existence's greatest mysteries. Also, because I figured I deserved a little something for saving the universe, I gave myself a dog.

With all that in place, I've decided to switch my consciousness back into the one here on Earth. Of course, I'll always remember those days fondly but these days, things aren't so bad either, not with cheery Bobbert Everett by my side. As for my old comrades, I've written a bit of security into their lives as well. Ryan and Joy are going to be quite well secured receiving some mystery inheritance money once they come of age. As for Ling, well, we've also grown quite close over these few weeks ever since her family moved into the neighborhood. All that was totally not me, by the way and it was completely a stroke of chance. Perhaps there is a creator somewhere out there. Or someone else with the same powers I had, or something else. But I'm pretty sure at least, someone somewhere is watching us and hence why we continue to exist.

Apparently the league was ambushed on the pier. They held a school bus full of children hostage and had to surrender against Count Badman and Lord Nightman and their goons.

I looked up at back and lazily got up out of my seat and said ""Alright, I have an idea."" 

My big plan was to infiltrate the Evil Order's HQ as cooks and sabotage their defenses as they celebrate their victory against the league while their guard is down. Fortunately, they have no idea who I am. I have never been in a big battle against any of the leaders of the Order. We slipped past their defenses and borrowed a couple of the chef's outfits.

 ""I'll start making some cheese, you prepare the wine,"" I snickered as I took the lead in the kitchen pretending Rocket was my sous-chef. I got convinced the rest of the chefs in the kitchen that I was asked by the Order's bigs to change up the menu abit. 

As the party ended I took up the stage as all the villains squirm on the floor. Rocketman enters the room with the other heroes as they witness me towering over all of the order on the big stage.

""I hope you all enjoyed the cheese with your wine."" I snickered as I made sure the dairy that they all consumed started to give them stomachaches that made them want to kill themselves. They would feel it about to come out of their ass only to find it slither back up their intestines. It was over as soon as everyone started grabbing their finger foods to go with their wines. There was no fight.

The League has won. All thanks to Dairyman.

"[WP] You are a detective that has just uncovered the identity of a major celebrity travelling the world killing famous aging musicians, along with the plan for the next victim.",T-E-N-G-E-N,"He always thought the movies lied whenever there was a big corkboard with pictures and string. How could that help anyone? As he stared at one in front of his – one that had taken over a complete wall in his dusty apartment, he finally saw how they helped. The strings spread over the whole board connecting faces that everyone knew. Faces people had grown up with. Faces people mourned. 

The strings connected the grief of Bowie, Lee, Rickman, Prince. And lead to one woman. 
She was clever, oh so clever. Building up a reputation that could never let her be seen as a suspect was a work of genius first and foremost. But seeking them out one by one, killing them in different ways.

“2016 a bad year for art” a headline strung up on the wall yelled out. 

Not a grave coincidence, murder. 

And not just 2016, her work was spun over years. Meticulous planning. As her career rose others took a dive. The count grew bigger as her influence did.

He had to let people know. Feverishly, he gathered up the newspaper clippings, the files upon files, brushing greasy hair out of his face.

He was cramming it all in a bag when his laptop let out a small noise. He dropped the bag on the table, papers spilling out and rushed over.

A twitter feed update. From her. Including a picture.

He clicked open the picture and gasped in horror, stumbling back from his computer.
Ian McKellen stood smiling out at the camera, an arm wrapped around a tall blonde woman.

“Not you too,” he whispered, the blue glow casting an eerie light on his pale face. 

He looked at the woman, his eyes brimming with tears, his face contorting with hate.

“I’ll get you,” he hissed before turning, grabbing the bag and stalking out of the room.
 
The laptop continued to hum in his absence, displaying the message.

“@taylorswift13: so lucky to meet @IanMcKellen ! great to have such amazing idols to learn off!”

Mittens was sitting at the foot of my bed. In my blurred morning vision I made out the clock to read 5:00 am. 

""Mittens, later. I need to sleep a little more,"" I pulled the blankets over my head.

""Ah hell nah!"" his tiny paws bounced all over my legs. He caught the blankets in his jaw and shook them off of the bed. ""For reals man? Mutha fucka cut my balls off? ARE YOU SERIOUS RIGHT NOW?""

""That was like eight months ago,"" I groaned. ""Every dog gets neutered. You kept grinding on the lady dogs at the park, it was awkward for everybody involved.""

""You gine ass bitch,"" his black beady eyes looked right into my soul. ""Nahhh man I'm just playing with you."" 

Mittens' tail wagged and he jumped off the bed, sprinting into the other room. Down the hall I heard him shouting, ""We have so much to do today. The park. The car. The store. The park. The pool?""

I walked into the kitchen and opened the costco bag of kibble. The kibble pellets clinged and clanged as they filled the silver bowl. Mittens sat there patiently and watched.

""What do you think you're doing?"" his little neck craned to look up to me.

""I'm giving you breakfast,"" I gestured to the bowl.

""Ryan,"" he sighed. ""Today is THE ONLY DAY that I don't have to eat this shit. Have you ever tasted this stuff? Taste it right now. It's SHIT. Over glorified shit with a picture of a smiling golden retriever on the bag, but I'll tell you: ain't NOBODY smiling after tasting this shit.""

""Well, then, what do you want?""

""Ham. All of the ham.""

""We don't have any ham.""

""Get you sorry ass shoes on, we're going to the store.""

Mittens' gray butt wriggled towards the door. We did end up going to the store to buy ham. In fact, we spent $45 on ham that day. It was better than last year when we communicated to me that he would only eat fresh Alaskan salmon.

On the way home we passed a Mexican grill and the smell of steaming carne asada followed the car. 

""FORGET THE HAM"" Mittens announced with his nose hanging outside of the window. ""Forget. The. Ham.""

""They won't let dogs in there,"" I continued driving.

""Ryan, you sorry ass bitch. Do you even comprehend the scarcity of life? The harmony in which all living things share, singing together with the same fire burning in their hearts. A fire burning for nothing other than that fresh mutha fucking asada. Do you understand? I look into your sorry ass grey eyes and I don't think you understand.""

""I'll do through the drive through I guess.""

When we finally reached the window to Alberto de Supreme I looked to Mittens who had been patiently sitting, nose high in the air, like he had won some great argument.

""What do you want,"" I looked to him.

He sat silently for a moment, turned his entire body towards me, and looked me in the eyes. ""Ham,"" he whispered.",squiddie96

Meatball proceeded to devour his medium rare skirt steak in two bites. He never believed in chewing. Even when he was just a baby mutt he would eat scraps that were double his size. Eventually he grew to become a giant German Shepard Husky mix suffering from an identity crisis as a prancing pony. 

""I can't believe the day we had! I got to bark at seagulls at the beach, you let me sniff that Poodle's butt at the doggy park, we watched Despicable Me while you gave me that back rub, oh man, oh man, what's next mom?! Can We get soft serve vanilla icecream?!?!? Oh man!""

""Yes Meatball, we will get anything you want, if you're up for it.""

""Yes! I'm up for everything?! This is the best day ever! I mean, we always have great days everyday. But they're even better on Talk Days! And I know we've only had that one other talk day when I was 35, but that was an awesome day!!!!!""

We stopped by Baskin Robbins on the way and picked up the soft serve. I brought a little bowl for his water for when he got thirsty. When we were done we got into the car &amp; Meatball shoved his head out the window for maximum wind surfing effect. 

I parked, shut off the car &amp; took a deep breath.

""Mom, you've been talking to me about this for a month now. It's okay. I'm ready. It's just sleeping for a long time right? We'll be together playing catch when you turn 70 too right? Maybe before then, you said?""

""I hope so."" I tried to smile but my head was pounding from my efforts to keep the tears from falling out. I usually can't carry Meatball. I used to not be able to carry Meatball but the cancer took a toll on his weight. So I opened the back door and heaved him onto myself to walk him inside the house where his vet was waiting. She said some consoling words, telling us to take our time. I looked at Meatball &amp; he just panted.

""You smell so sad Mom, it's okay. Really. I just... Could you please just stay with me until I fall asleep? Could you tell me a story? One where I conquer the evil squirrel who kept on stealing my treats last summer. I never did find him. Lost his scent...""

I was half way through telling him the story when he said, ""I love you mom.""

""I love you too"" I chocked out as I held my best friend.  ""I know mom. Thanks for the great Talk Day,"" he whispered. ""You can give the squirrel my toys. But keep one so you don't forget me. I don't want you to have to sniff the other dogs' butts when you're looking for me in heaven. Some of them don't wipe properly on the grass.""

""Okay, buddy. But I could never forget you.""

[WP] You're forced to live every day twice,awesmazingj,"My alarm bleeped and I opened an eye. Was this an even day, or was this the odd? I always forgot. 

I looked at the wall for the scratch mark I'd left last night, as I did every morning, and saw that it was still there. This was an even day.  I rubbed it off, then rolled over and went back to sleep.

""Honey, you're going to be late"" said my wife, but I ignored her.

I got to work a little before lunchtime and yawned through the usual talk I got from my boss every even day about how I was a model employee and that he would let my tardiness slide on account of my previous puncutality. He must have given that talk a thousand times.

I sat at my desk and checked the emails, answering none but writing down the names of people I'd need to respond to in order of priority. I browsed the internet and made a mental note of the top threads. 

My work tray was empty, but a few new side projects opened up and I read through them quickly getting the gist of the task and formulating a general plan of attack.

I spent the remainder of the day writing up the skeleton framework, and watching anime as the rest of the office walked by me with disgruntled looks as I ate pizza after pizza after pizza, sharing none with any of my coworkers. The bottles of vodka attracted a few curious looks, but no one called me out on it.

On my way out I trashed my computer scaring off my bewildered colleagues, then yanked out the gas pipe from the wall, lighting a match and setting the whole building on fire. 

I smashed my way into my boss's car and used the keys I'd swiped earlier from his office to plow straight through the fencing and into the municipal park where I cut through traffic and several people, evading the police with practiced ease as I screeched to a halt outside of my house.

The two escorts I'd phoned for earlier were already there, and I took the scantily clothed ladies up into the house whilst the neighbours watched with disapproving eyes. My wife made a scene, as she usually did but I knew of her junkie days that she confessed to me once during these even days, and it didn't take much meth to talk her into a threesome.

Before the waves of hedonistic ecstasy hit me, I left a mark on the wall.

*****

My alarm bleeped and I opened an eye. Was this an even day, or was this the odd? I always forgot. 

I looked at the wall for the scratch mark I'd left last night, as I did every morning, and saw that the mark was gone. This was an odd day. I stretched and sat up, feeling absolutely fine as I whistled on my way to work.

My work tray was empty as usual, but I already knew what was coming and rewrote the skeleton base I'd made yesterday, now filling in the blanks with more detail. I jumped onto the internet and posted in the threads that I'd tracked the day before, writing what I remember to be the top comments.

By the time 10:30 came, I was finished with my day.  I poured myself a cup of tea, and had a light and early lunch where everyone remarked on my excellent physique and work ethic. 

I talked with the boss, and managed to leave early as I zipped calmly through town back to the house, where a courier was waiting for me on the porch as planned, with half a dozen roses for my wife.

She was delighted by my sweet gesture, and I got an appreciative wink from one of the neighbours as she led me into the house. We made a light supper together, and then sat on the couch watching a movie with our heads touching as we murmurred to each other thoughts about our future.",tomatoaway

The voice in your head all those years ago was right [WP],hfhfhfhfaaa,"A dark and grimy alleyway. The air is filled with the smells of exhaust fumes and the odour of the rotting and damping garbage from the dumpsters that stand around. The floors are covered in the waste of its residents and your occasional heroin junkies and drunks. The walls are disguised by the graffiti messages of the urban teens and gangs that claim they’re the city’s kings. 
This place, the gutter, I call home… 

One year has passed since I became homeless. I didn’t became homeless because of any addiction, but you can say that a drinking problem stood next to the cradle wherein this mess was born. And yet I knew it was wrong, even before it all started. If only I would’ve listened then…

His night sucked. He thought that a weekend in Vegas to celebrate his two-year relationship with his girlfriend would be something special. Not the kind of special that he was experiencing know: The girl was crying for her parents in the bathroom after some minor argument he couldn’t seem to remember the reason for. 
But the kind of special that you see in those movies teenage girls are always too eager to see. It was about 9 p.m. and the hotel room was damping hot. The fan on the ceiling probably broke down a few decades ago and now he had to suffer in some sort of self-created hell.
He opened the minibar and already felt better after the first few gulps. In fact, it seemed that he didn’t even heard the annoying sobbing-sounds anymore. He had found a way to save his broken night.

He felt an arm around his shoulders, followed by soft whispering; ‘…..I’m sorry alright…. Please stop …. Love you way too much for this…….’ He couldn’t really make out many words. Soon after he felt his bottle being taken out of his hands and put down gently. Tears poured over his face as he buried his face in her arms, softly sobbing a marriage proposal. He found a girl, caring like this, way too sad to give up…

-

That was then, before she became all greedy and the kids chose to ‘live with mommy.’ If only I had listened to myslef in that hotel room. What is one sad weekend compared to a life of happiness?

This morning a young boy, shopping with his mother, gave me some cash. It's time to forgive my mind for this huge mistake...

I feel happy as I bring the bottle to my mouth.

"[WP] You are Captain Hook, a naval officer tasked with hunting down Peter Pan, a dangerous fugitive known for abducting boys, brainwashing them, and murdering them when he deems them too old.",iambookfort,"The Jolly Roger sailed into Hullbreaker Bay under the light of the full moon. Smee clutched at the edge of the crow's nest, fretting over each individual rock that darked poke out of the black waves and bracing for each impact every other minute. Were it sunny, he would have been able to see the bared bones of the other warships that had been sent after Pan and ended up in the murky depths. But Hook's bravery and deft mastery of the wheel carried them safely to the sandy shores, where a fire was already burning. 

Hook, Smee, and a dozen other members of the crew alighted in landing boats and paddled to the beach. They had to be silent; word was that this Peter Pan had spies all over the island. Some even claimed that he had mermaids watching for threats from beneath the sea, though Hook dismissed those aggrandizing laws. Surely this Pan's reputation was overblown; the legends claim that he never aged, that he could fly... all falsehoods designed to intimidate lesser men than Hook.

On the shore, faces loomed out of the darkness. Terrifying specters, covered in intricate patterns of white and black warpaint. Each man carried a pointed spear or a curved tomahawk, and they eyed the sword at Hook's side with great suspicion. The same fear was also present in the eyes of Hook's men, who clutched their own weapons closer and formed into a tight knot. But Hook strode forward, away from the safety of his men, and approached the tribesmen in the shadows. Their leader, wearing a beautiful headdress of multicolored feathers, stepped forward to greet Hook. 

""I am Chief Great Big Little Panther."" Hook shook his hand and introduced himself as a captain in the Queen's navy. Together, they sat down in the sand next to the fire. ""You come to hunt the Peter Pan,"" the native chief continued. He'd seen enough similar companies of white men come to Neverland Island to know their purpose without even asking. ""You are brave. But so were many of the others.""

Hook smiled. ""I'm not like the others."" Something in his voice reassured everyone that he actually meant it. ""I was told that you might have information about this bandit that we can use?""

""He's a *demon*!"" one of the natives shouted. Great Big Little Panther turned back to glare, and the warrior who had shouted slinked back into the forest. 

""He is... dangerous,"" the chief rephrased. ""And he commands dark magic. He and his Lost Boys have made war upon my tribe for years now, and I have lost many brothers. Some warriors say that he had protective fairies over him, and that he has no shadow. Other say that he commands the beasts of the island and feeds his foes to a giant alligator.""

Captain Hook waved a hand while resting the other hand on his hip. ""Please, chieftan. I've heard enough lies about this man to fill a lifetime. I want *facts*. Where can I find this rogue?""

Great Big Little Panther smiled. Maybe this one *would* be different. Perhaps, if he would succeed against these Lost Boys, this Captain Hook might make a worthy suitor for the chief's beautiful daughter, Tiger Lily. ""He lives in the mountains in the north of the island,"" the Chief said. With a long stick, he drew a crude map in the sand and planted a torch nearby for light. ""He and his lost boys are like apes, living in trees and caves.""

Hook studied the map, committing it to memory. ""And what do you know about these Lost Boys?""

The chief shook his head with a grimace. ""Poor souls. Pan kidnaps them in their youth and trains them to use a bow and knife with deadly effectiveness. Do not underestimate them, despite their age; they'll kill you before you even see them hiding in the canopy. Make sure you kill them first.""

Hook smiled. ""I don't intend to *kill them* at all. Her Majesty the Queen has given me permission to come *rescue* these boys. I'm here to bring the bandit to justice and set the rest free.""

The warriors in the jungle whispered. ""That is good,"" Great Big Little Pantheranswered. ""A much better future than what Peter Pan would give them. For the ones that don't fall in battle, he..."" The chief gave a deep sigh, and gestured over his shoulder. ""It is better to just show you.""

Six men in war paint emerged from the bushes carrying a stretcher, covered in woven palm fronds. The warriors set the stretcher down in the sand near the fire and stepped away. The beach was silent as the chief left the impression sink in. Hook already knew what would be under the cover; even before departing, he'd already feared the worst for the missing boys. No matter how much he didn't want it to be true. When Big Little Panther lifted the covering, it confirmed everything. He was at least a foot taller, and the boy's skin was bronze with a suntan and his chestnut hair was bleached by sun, but of course Hook recognized the face of his son even after all these years. His eyes were closed, but his mouth was frozen in an expression of shock. Clearly he hadn't expected the knife that Pan had shoved in his gut. 

Hook took a deep breath, unable to move his gaze from his son's body. After what seemed like an eternity, he put the covering back in place and said a silent prayer for his son. ""At least he's at peace, now."" He waved over for some of his men to bring the body back to the ship to prepare for burial.

The chief nodded in agreement. ""It's bad enough that he kills *my* warriors, and now he kills his own? Someone must put an end to this madness.""

Hook stood. ""You have my word, Chief Great Big Little Panther. I'll risk life and limb to bring him to justice."" He turned back to his own men. ""To the boats! We sail north!""

She sat with her daughter, who is only four years old, and they were eating burgers and drinking shakes.

""Slug bug."" Her daughter lightly jabbed her arm. It was a dry wind outside and they were thinking of spending the day down by the river. ""Mom, do you think the car gets hot and wants to be in the shade too?""

Her daughter's hair was pulled back into a braid and she sat looking out at the other kids who were getting ready to go swimming at the pool. She shakes her head yes while chewing on her sandwich. Her daughter, seeing her answer, was satisfied with her response. They drove down to the river and some other people had the same idea, it was 15 dollars for a pool pass and it could get really crowded. 

""Don't go into far baby,"" She hollers as her daughter runs to the flowing river, ""Don't go into the water higher than your bum!"" 

She carries her cooler and a umbrella she found to a nice spot and they spend their whole day here. By the time her daughter is done, the sun was setting and she was sleeping on the towel they brought. So, she loads up their gear and watches the sun set a little.

 At first he went out every evening and every night he met girls. It came easy for him, but he cared not for their company, for all he cared for was her.
 
Then he started to sell everything his company offered to everyone, who was willing to buy. It was hard work that paid off generously and yet he cared not, for all he cared for was her.

He traveled near and far. To countries he had only seen in movies and on TV. He saw life as he would never imagine and talked with people, who were different from him in every way. But he cared not, for all he cared for was her.

One beautiful summer day he went for a walk. Sunglasses in his hand as he hated to wear them when not facing the sun. He saw her in distance with a new man by her side. She said ‘Hi’ to him and he replied in same manner. He put on his sunglasses and walked forward, for all he cared for was her.

I can't believe that only 1hr after being onboared at ksp I was told be I'll be going to the Mun. I didn't think to much of it as I'll be only the 3rd kerban to set foot on our closest satellite. But now as the rocket rolls out to the launch pad, I worry if should have had any training for this mission. They just picked me up off the street after all! 

T + 1 day

I'm in low kerban orbit! I can't say how gratified that assent is over. Jeb is crazy. On the way up he purposefully spun the rocket, just so he would have more fun... I don't know how I kept my breakfast down, I think I fainted through and woke up in a pile of Bob's breakfast... 

T + 5 days

We made it to Mun orbit! Electronic change is running low.. one of the solar panels didn't deploy. As engineering I had to go out and try and fix it. As I suited up for EVA,  Jeb gave me pointers on using the jetpack while Bob rambled about what science I should record when outside the capsule. I gave it my best try to fix the panel, but turns out the supplier used blue paint instead of solar panel stuff. We managed to recover electric charge by adjusting our attitude. Turns out or working panel, one they actually built correctly, wasnt in the sunlight... 

T + 7 days

I walked on the Mun! Jeb went off on a walk without letting anyone know, don't know when he'll be back... Meanwhile I'm helping Bob collect all the science! He sure is a smart guy, it's clear he puts up with Jeb and his antics so he can benefit kerban with the science he collects. 

T + 8 days 

Jeb finally returned. He wouldn't tell us where he been but he did mention something about we have no fuel left. The spacecraft engineers didn't give us enough fuel for our mission! We are stuck up here for who knows how long! Bob thinks Jeb knew about the lack of fuel before we left... The kracken take him! I was able to contact ksp on the radio, they say they are working on a rescue mission...

T + 20 days

Still stuck in this tiny capsule. The first rescue mission they sent didn't leave the kerban atmosphere. In their rush to build the ship they forgot to add struts. Poor ship didn't stand a chance. However long I'm up here I'm still amazed by the sight of kerban rising over the Mun horizon.

One week after the launch of the first Munar mission, I was finally given my chance to fly.  The Munar return flight had run out of fuel after a badly executed landing, and had only just limped to a Kerbin fly-by.  It was a pretty grave situation by all means, since the return trajectory would take the one-man command pod near Kerbin but never touching the atmosphere.  A rescue mission had been hastily thrown together, and my time had finally come.

The rescue mission was quite simple in theory.  Burn a rocket up to a low orbit, rendezvous with the stricken command pod, complete a crew transfer and burn for splashdown not far from the space centre.  I was excited to go to space, I'd been waiting my turn for more than enough time, but when the time came I admit I was quite nervous.  I'd seen many rockets far more lovingly constructed than this one break apart on launch, or had the parachutes fail on re-entry.  Only this year did I personally witness a Kerbonaut classmate of mine burn up in the upper reaches of the atmosphere.  That was a really testing week for us all, but the program marched on as always.  Couldn't the chief engineer see these problems?

My mind was eased, and yet slightly baffled, by the last-minute addition of a probe core to my command pod.  For the uninitiated, a probe core is a computer which flies the rocket from the space centre.  It seemed superfluous as I could be piloting the vehicle, but at least someone else would be remotely controlling the rocket  - I felt a little better knowing I wouldn't be directly responsible for a missed rendezvous.

On the morning of departure I left my small apartment, and began the lonely drive to the space centre.  It was strangely quiet at the launchpad - nobody was there to check the rocket, nobody to give words of encouragement.  I supposed that the program didn't want too much publicity on this one, but couldn't Gene have at least given me a traditional ""Godspeed""?

The burn to orbit was one of the most incredible moments of my life.  Such speed, such raw power; it was awesome to behold.  I remember the sky turning black and the lurch in my stomach as I entered zero G.  I really had made it to space, and no matter what anyone said to me now I was finally a real Kerbonaut.  Back at the space centre that gold star next to your name meant everything and you were nothing without it.  You were known as a ""Penguin"" before your first gold star - all flap and no fly.

The probe core was working well, and the crew at the space centre were working the numbers brilliantly.  I would rendezvous on my second orbit, which would also be the record for the quickest rendezvous of the program.  The nerves were starting to fade, although re-entry lay ahead in the near future.  I tried not to think about my classmate and his charred command pod - I was starting to have faith in this rocket.

The rendezvous was well under way now, the engines were firing hard and I felt myself pressed back in to my seat.  I watched as the stricken command pod came in to view - 5km, 4km, 1km.  I watched the the relative velocity shrink down from thousands of kilometres an hour to a gentle jog of 1m/s before finally reaching 0.  I watched as the Kerbonaut exited his command pod and jetted the small distance.  He came to the door, I prepared myself as he tried the handle.

Nothing.  

He tried again.

Nothing.  

A message came over the radio.

""Rescue Ship 1, this is KSC.  Is anybody in the command pod?  Over.""

I fumbled for the pressel switch.  ""KSC, Rescue 1 - affirmative.  I am in the command pod and looking at the Kerbonaut now, over.""  I gave a little wave through the window.  The other Kerbonaut seemed pretty angry.

""Rescue 1, KSC.  This was supposed to be an unmanned rescue mission.  There is only one seat.  Who told you to get in the rocket?  Over"".

Boy, was my face red.

I pledged my allegiance to all of Kerbin. To Jeb the prophet, may we all escape this planet for the stars as he did.  
I also followed with the informal pledge to not die the fire death of shame, as so so many have done.  
Finally, I put my faith in the designer, the creator who sets out our ships for our departures, and chooses those deserving for the one-way flights, the mighty for planets unknown and the golden for a way back to our home.

I got in the pitch-black elevator to the top. We were taught not to look at the craft. The elevator is a peaceful place as it slowly ascends, the noise of the pulleys in the shaft rattling quietly. Keep your eyes ahead. Keep focused. Think of Jeb.

Don't you see Martha, I am doing this for you and the kids. All I've ever done has been for you and the kids. 

How is this for us, Jeb? We are drowning in debt, we can't afford little Jethro's rehabilitation as it is. The program won't bring in as much money as working in the oilfield. We can't survive without you, please don't go. 

Tears rained down from Martha's face like satellites that failed to obtain geosynchronous orbit as she watched Jeb board the bus.  

Jeb thought hard about his family, and the decision that he made while heading toward the base. He wanted to explain everything to Martha, but had she known the truth she would have jumped in front of the bus to prevent his departure. For Jeb had taken the job, not for fame or glory, nor for the advancement of science, but rather because the only way he could ever provide for his family the way they needed and deserved to be provided for was if he died. The stipulations of his contract granted a 10 million kerblec life insurance policy to be paid in the event of death during the performance of Kerbonaut duties. 

As the countdown started, Jeb was nervous but determined. The initial thrust of the engine shook the crew cabin violently. Then, like a young Kerbal learning to walk, the rocket took its first steps toward the heavens, except the stupid thingy did not disengage properly because the builder is still new to the whole ordeal, and even though there were pre-made rockets to use, decided ""No, I can do this, how hard can this be, why do I need fins/ how the hell do I properly mount a satellite."" As the weight of the massive rocket, coupled with uneven amount of thrust being exerted by the one working engine, caused it to tilt, falling toward the kerbal, Jeb was at peace holding a picture of his family; calm, ready to enter into the welcoming warmth of a massive fuel explosion.

[WP] We find evidence of a now extinct race on another planet. We bring DNA samples back to Earth and use them to resurrect the species.,nickofnight,"For decades, scientists from the E.C.O. alliance have been studying the ecosystem of Aries-Centari-IV. By a freak stroke of luck, the earth-like ecosystem seems to have created life by and large much like earth, at least on the surface. Recently, however, new discoveries about the microbial life on the surface of the planet has stirred even more interest from the E.C.O. Many of them seem to have oxygen producing properties, which scientists hope that, with care, could be use to restore Sol-III to an at least livable T1 class planet, thus allowing the Terrans to recolonize.

“...ugh...more of this crap?” a fairly young Octan woman shouted back towards the two men from earlier.

“Ey shut up and get to work, this crap’s worth more than your flap.”

“Yeah, it ain’t easy getting this sludge with all those bugs out!”

The Octan rolled her eyes, sliding the container off the table and lugging it into the back room of the ship’s laboratory. “Hey Dimitry, we’ve got more slime to work with.”

A short balding Terran in one of the large glass quarantine chambers left his work, quickly hopping into the hazard shower and stepping out to greet her. “Ah, Rea! We’ve got more already?” he shouted enthused.
“Yeah.” Rea snapped back sarcastically.
“Huh, the expeditions are going faster than I expected... Come, let’s bring that sludge to the back!” The Terran scientist Dimitry smiled as he helped the young Octan carry the large vat of mud into the quarantine chambers.

“Let’s put ‘er down here.” the scientist spoke once more, as the two set down the containment unit. Gesturing to the nearby closet, the scientist continued “It’s probably for the best you get a suit on before we head in there.""

Rea walked over to the closet, and quickly grabbed a hazmat suit that appeared like it would fit her. It looked like it would be a little too large, but to be honest it was to be expected. Research fields in the modern days of the E.V.O. were very integrated between the different races, anything besides a one-size-fits-all for any of them was typically ordered beforehand. “So, how’s the regeneration going?” she asked Dimitry, whom was now hunched over the door’s opening mechanism, pressing his finger to the scanner marked “TERRAN”.

“Ah, we’ve been working wonders since you last signed in for work, Rea. We’ve managed to revive some rather interesting specimens. There’s this one that-” Sirens began to echo across the entire facility. “...shit.” was all Dimitry could think to say as the glow of red sirens began to bounce off all the walls in the laboratory, before stopping a few moments later.

“...I take it that’s not a good sign.” Rea quickly asked.

“Your first clue was?” Dimitry snapped back. Sighing, he continued “Well, at least they got it contained, I’m going to go check on the damages.” Pressing his finger to the scanner again, the door opened and he stepped inside. “Go tell the ground soldier to stand by. We’re going to need backup if we created something hostile.” Pressing a button on the other side of the door, it slammed shut, and Dimitry rushed deeper into the quarantine zone.

“What happened?!” Dimitry shouted as he stepped into the room that appeared to be where the incident occurred. One of the other scientists still visibly in shock, pointed over to the thick wall made of glass on the right side of the room. A couple of corpses adorned the floor. It appeared that despite their current wear, something had gotten through and offed them quite quickly. All of them seemed to be covered in green sludge.

Before Dimitry could ask any questions, a Arian scientist rushed up to him. “Dimitry. I need to show you something. Now.” Not wasting any time, the two rushed into the back of the quarantine area to a room filled with massive screens monitoring each of the testing rooms. Stepping towards the computer console at the bottom, the Arian quickly shoved the device into the bottom, typed out a few commands, and then unplugged it, as a holographic recording of the room they were just in appeared in between the two.

“...we were testing one of the specimens we had found with the most oxidizing potential. To see how it would react to the harsh chemicals in Sol-III’s atmosphere. Dimitry watched the holographic replay as two scientists stepped into the glass portion of the chamber, fully dressed in hazmat suits, and approaching a small petri dish with aerosol cans of various chemicals in hand. Spraying a generous portion over the dish, the microbes seemed to multiply at a rate visible to the unaided eye, as green sludge oozed over the top. The two scientists rushed away towards the door as two of the scientists outside of the chamber simultaneously pulled down on levers at the door of the room as all the other scientists rushed out. It appeared that this is what happened as the sirens went off. The building green residue exploded and splashed across the entire room, covering the two fleeing scientists as they began to scream, before dropping to the ground.

“...Cla...which cloned specimen was that?” Dimitry quickly asked.

“S-specimen AC4-219. Non-scientific name: Centaurian Pond Scum” Cla quickly stuttered back.

“Cla...we can’t let this get onto Sol-III. It’s going to kill everyone on the Committee.”

Cla was quiet. Dimitry quickly spoke up. “...you already sent some off didn’t you?”

“...three days ago. The drones should have arrived a few hours ago...”

“...call the Sol base. If any of the local atmosphere leaks in they’re going to have a lot more to worry about than a fire hazard on their hands.”

Cla nodded, as she immediately made a beeline to the console, starting up the ship’s communication system. Dimitry rushed out the door towards the other rooms in the laboratory. It’d be for the best if the science lab was closed while they got things sorted out. Stepping by the room from before, the sirens went off again. Peaking into the room, Dimitry was able to see something shocking. In place of the scientists was nothing more than piles of bones, and a fairly large swarm of small gelatinous creatures were at the solid titanium door, slowly oozing their way through the microscopic cracks. Cla rushed out from the back room and behind Dimitry. “Okay, change of plans. Tell the captain to sent out a rescue beacon. We’re going to have to evacuate.” she shouted. Dimitry nodded, and the two rushed out. The weather outside was far from pleasant, as humid and warm as it was, but it certainly beat chancing it with the unnatural creatures from the lab.",GravityGamesInt

With a palm slapping his infant backside to ensure his breathing, he filled his lungs with air just to cry out and scream - the realization had struck, and struck hard- He was born in New Jeresy, and the wheel of life just turned another time, this time for the worst.

[WP] The tastiness of a meat dish is directly related to how much the animal suffered during it's life. You are the head chef at one of the best restaurants in the country.,BarrySquared,"This is actually true. If the animal is relaxed right before slaughter, then the meat has high glycogen levels that turn into lactic acid. The lactic acid gives the meat a good color, taste, and tenderness. 

If the animal is stressed, then the glycogen is used up. This causes the meat to become pale, soft, and acidic, and can't be used (in pigs) or dark, firm, and dry (in cows and sheep.) Without the lactic acid, the meat spoils much faster, too, so it can't be stored for a decent length of time.

She stared down at the world below - and at the very distinct demarcation of its edge, that very edge that every kid in school knew wasn't real.

""How..."", she began, and trailed off.

From their vantage point in the upper atmosphere, she could easily see through the cloud cover to the ocean features below: first, the massive whirlpools, raging in the water below; beyond that, the crashing waterfalls, miles high and slanted at impossible angles; and there, at the edge of the earth itself, the towering cliffs of ice and snow that rose and fell in bizarre, unexplainable formations.

Sarah Ressman had a knot in her stomach as her eyes took this in, and felt her brain struggling to process what she was looking at.

*It's flat. It's always been flat.*

The thought was, at the same time, clearly a fact and yet not acceptable.

""We've known since the late 1500s,"" said Rajzer, watching her with his trademark deep concentration. ""You've heard of Colombus, and Cortes, and Cartier, and all the rest of those explorers, but not many people know about a man named Diego de Saltiano. In October 1571 he was part of an expedition, setting out with three ships past South America to find...well, whatever they could. Figured they'd be safe at that time of year.""

Rajzer gave a dramatic pause, and Sarah turned to look at him. 

""But they weren't?""

""No,"" Rajzer continued, looking amused. ""He wasn't. Out of 77 sailors on three big ships, one eventually made it back to Lima - Saltiano. It was two years later, and he came back in rags on a spice ship from the Philippines. Captain said they found him adrift in a lifeboat, nearly dead and raving mad. Talking nonsense about cliffs in the ocean, whirlpools ten leagues across, that sort of thing."" He nodded towards the window, and Sarah looked back at the earth below. ""Those cliffs. Those whirlpools.""

Her brow furrowed as she considered this.

""So they were shipwrecked, and he got away?""

""Most people thought he had gone mad on the sea. That the sun and the thirst got to him while he floated out there alone. The governors of Peru decided to send him back to Spain, and once he was back in Europe, it wasn't long before his story got to some of the Renaissance scientists. The intellectual class. The *wealthy* class.""

""So they funded more trips, then? Why does nobody know about this? Why haven't you told people?!"" Sarah's tone got indignant and defensive. She didn't like being caught off guard, and she didn't like being lied to; here she was, though, and it seemed as if her entire life up to this point consisted of those two feelings.

The knot in her stomach tightened.

""More expeditions occurred, yes. Most ended in failure, and many never came back at all, for a number of reasons. First, the distance between the Edge and the continents was severely underestimated - it's actually several thousand miles farther than most sailors anticipated, so many crews starved before they even reached anything remarkable. Once they began stocking up on more provisions, and actually getting near the Edge, it was clear that *something* was going on out there. But that knowledge came with a whole slough of other trouble.""

Sarah studied the sea below, trying to make out the different areas. Even from where she sat, nearly three hundred miles high, she could see how big and imposing the cliffs of ice were, and how terrifying the whirlpools would be if you were facing them.

Rajzer removed his glasses to clean them as he continued. ""Finally, in the 1660s, crews began returning with viable information about what are now called the Maelstroms of Saltiano, and the Impassable Cliffs. It took a further two decades, and Newton's theories on gravitation, for scientists to realize that those features existed because of the earth's flat shape."" Rajzer replaced his glasses, and thought for a moment, his eyes darting. ""See, at the center of the disk, gravity pulls straight down. As you go further - past the continents, past the outer seas, past everything you know on world maps - it begins to tilt, more and more. You must lean forward a little farther with every step as you walk, until at the very edge, it's like you are hanging off a cliff. Sailors that did not understand this drove their ships straight into the water, without even knowing it.""

Sarah looked unsure. ""How does that make *this* happen, though?"" She cocked a thumb at the ice below, glinting in the sunlight.

""Think, Miss Ressman, of how the water would pile up if gravity were slanted. How eerily it would look to us, accustomed to a different set of physical laws. Think of how ice would build up, break off, create looming cliffs that from afar, seem to jut into the air at impossible angles, but from below would simply be straight up. Change your perspective as you look at the earth, and believe me, it will make more sense.""

She glanced down again at the formations under the ship, and tilted her head slightly. *So if gravity were like this...* And just like that, it did seem to work. It was unsettling, true, but it worked.

""For hundreds of years,"" Rajzer went on, checking the status of the ship's autopilot and trajectory as he did so, ""ships tried to cross those storms, and sank. The ones that made it, broke up on the ice beyond, and the sailors died attempting to climb cliffs that could be ten, twelve miles high. Only one expedition, in 1944, ever made it past there, but the government lost radio contact with the two survivors about 30 miles from the Edge, and we don't know if they made it over. So in 1958, NASA was born - and a primary objective of ours was to get to the other side of the earth.""

Sarah exhaled, a heavy and meaningful breath. ""Jesus,"" she said, and could find no more. Simple strings of sounds didn't seem adequate for the situation.

""We've spent a long time getting the mechanics right, the equations, the parameters,"" Rajzer said. ""Our ships have been to the edge and back, like we're doing now. But your mission, next year, will be to get to the far side."" Another pause. ""And if possible, a landing.""

Sarah's eyes widened, reconciling the hostile environment below with the information he had just given.

""You have to be fucking with me,"" she said, deadpan. ""S-sir.""

Now his brows furrowed, and he returned her stare. ""I'm doing no such thing, Miss Ressman,"" he replied. ""Far from it, in fact. We at NASA believe this is a necessary - and time-sensitive - step. Because we have reason to suspect that there is something over there, waiting for us.""

Even in the low gravity of their ship, Sarah's hair stood on end - it wasn't just what Rajzer had said, but the way he had stated it so explicitly.

""Some- something?"" she stammered. ""Like what?""

Rajzer settled into his seat, and cleared his throat uncomfortably.

""Something smart,"" he finally offered. ""Something big."" The worst pause yet. ""Something bad.""",MakesYouSoundEpic

What do you say to them?”
“Redlo, how do we know you’re not just looking for attention.”
Ryan Redlo attempted to calm all the reporters down. The young man gave a charismatic grin.
“All of the answers to these are on my website,” he waved a manila folder in the air, “After you look through it, I’m sure you’ll all agree with me, that the Earth, is in fact, flat.”
He opened his car door.
“Just visit www.redlosnotebook.com!” He said loud enough for all the reporters to hear.
*Crazy reporters…* Ryan thought. 
His phone went off.
“Hey honey!”
He picked up the phone.
“Hey Jill. How ya doing babe?”
“Hey did you pick up the food? The parties starting in an hour.”
“I know,” Ryan looked at the back of his car, “It’s all”-
 

“Mr. Redlo.”
Ryan looked up.
A man in a black suit stood in front of him.
“Where am I…?”
“Mr. Jerefson will be here to see you in a minute.”
The man in the suit left.
The room was musty, jail cell like. Ryan’s hands were cuffed behind his back. Did he crash into someone? What did he do?
Ryan studied his body. There was not a scratch. Then how could he have crashed? At least he thought it was a crash…
Mr. Jerefson strolled in. 
“Hello, Ryan. It’s come to our attention you’ve been doing some, studies, lately.”
“Uh yes, Mr. Jerefson, I’ve been doing”-
“Please,” Mr. Jerefson folded his hands. “Call me Brad. We’ll be getting to know one another very well soon.”
“Ok well, Brad, I’ve been researching my hypothesis that the Earth is flat. To be honest, if this is some mental asylum, I don’t actually think the Earth is flat. I just need the money.” Ryan relaxed his shoulders. “It just got a lot of popularity lately from this YouTube video I posted.”
“Were not a ‘mental asylum.’ You’re in the NASA U.R.F.”
“U.R.F?”
“Underground research facility. But you’re not here to join some insane inmates, you’re here to join us. We need a new scientist after we lost Annie to the border…” For a second the man’s face looked distraught, before turning back to his normal stone cold expression.
“The border?” Ryan’s eyes grew wide. “What do you mean?”
“Haven’t you figured it out by now.” Brad got on his knees and leaned forward. “You’re here to help us protect the populous from the edge. The edge of the world. Are you willing to help?
Ryan grinned. “Of course.”

The proto-archetypal concept of a world that was limited, not spherically perpetual, but with distinct edges, borders to the plane of our existence. To have it confirmed by the infamously empirically minded Bradshaw, director of NASA, was another matter entirely.

""You are saying, director-""

""That you were correct in your conception of Earth, mr Shan. You see, reason is the stepping stone the moderately intelligent take to outshine the mediocre, but true intelligence knows that reason is a human construct, and therefore easily manipulated. Our self-deception, unlike Earth, knows no bounds when we have stakes in the matter, and the prevailing of what we call reason has always been the biggest stake for those who consider themselves intelligent.""

""Easily manipulated? The lies you told the public are extremely intricate-""

""But ultimately a matter of trust and belief. As everything is. No, mr Shan, the only truth that is pure and unmistakable, lies beyond the edges of Earth. No vast, empty cosmos, no void specked with glittering stars, or massive other planets. The skies we observe above us are painted by another thing entirely, brush strokes of a truth the majority humanity wouldn't be able to handle.""

""God?"" I asked scornfully. Even though I had pursued this image of a flat world since my youth, religion had always seemed ludicrous to me.

""Not in the way it is conceived by churches or earthly powers,"" Bradshaw smiled. ""No, what lies beyond the Edge is more than all that. Tell me, mr Shan, are you familiar with the original story of humanity's conception?""

""What, Adam and Eve?"" I asked. If I hadn't uncovered all the lengths NASA went through to deceive the public, I would have suspected he was mocking me.

""More than that, mr. Shan, the Primal Creation Myth. Told in every religion, everywhere around the world. There is always a flood, a snake, and a tree. Ouroboros, Ophion, Vritra, the Rainbow Snake, Lucifer. Yggdrasil, Világfa, Ashvattha, Kien-Mu, Knowledge. Humanity has been imprisoned here, mr. Shan, on earth, encircled by an enormous snake that binds the edges of our oceans, contracting ever closer over the millenia, until the floods will drown us all.""

I was speechless, but Bradshaw seemed to take my silence as a prerogative for more.

""What do you think our astronauts have really been doing, mr Shan? We do more than fabricating pictures of that part of our sky that is called Luna, we send brave men and women to their death every year in our quest to slay the Serpent that confines our Earth.""

""And beyond?"" I asked breathlessly. ""What lies beyond?!""

Bradshaw's eyes glinted with a passion I had rarely seen in him. ""The Tree, mr Shan. The Tree of Worlds. Where all parallel worlds meet, where time becomes a traveller's plaything and all possibilities of existence lie stretched out in front of you. The key to the universe, mr Shan.""

I sat down. It was all too much to take in. I hadn't asked for this. All I wanted was some confirmation that I was not insane, a flat earth, and nothing more.

Bradshaw patted me on the back. ""I remember when I first found out. It's not an easy responsibility to bear, mr Shan. But now, of course, you will have to join us in our attempts.""

I gave Bradshaw an incredulous stare.

""What?"" he said grinning. ""This is only the beginning for you, mr Shan. This is where your real education begins, as an actual astronaut, trained by NASA's nautical academies, not one of the actor's you've seen on tv. Prepare to find out where the actual budgets have gone, mr Shan. Your training begins today.""",Writeful_heir

[WP] Bill Gates is actually a serial killer. He uses his altruistic behavior to avoid suspicion. You find out the truth.,CrownPierrot,"I just happened to stumble on it while I was cleaning. I had been working as a personal maid to Bill Gates. Bill *fucking* Gates! The pay was amazing, the house was already so tidy I was more or less being paid for doing nothing. But that saying, what was it again? Idle hands are the 'devils playthings'? I was just walking through the house, the only person home at the time, Mr Gates having gone to *another* fundraiser. Something about helping child soldiers in Africa, or victims of the Boko Haram.

Curiosity got the better of me. I decided to enter Bill's office. The one place he said to never actually enter, something about there being sensitive subjects in there. Despite that, he never actually locked it. Too trusting that guy. It could honestly barely be called an office, just a desk, an empty bookcase and an old computer. Beyond old it was--holy shit, this is one of the first computers. Not 1950's style, but...I think it was one of the first ones he built in that garage. I couldn't help but wonder, does this dinosaur even connect to the internet?

So I tried it, booted it up Windows 3. Huh. Didn't think it even went that low. Didn't connect to the internet, I don't think it even had a modern ethernet port. No programs..just a file directory, a photo album. When I clicked on it--I almost threw up. A pale corpse, restrained in a chair. Taken to pieces--burn marks, strips of flesh missing, missing fingers. In all of them was Bill Gates, sometimes old, sometimes young, just posing with them. Like a hunter with a deer they just brought down. 

I should have just closed it right there and then. Put everything back where it was, close the door, and quietly resign a month or two later. Maybe just call the police. But I didn't. I went on, with a morbid fascination. I went on and on through the album, so absorbed I didn't see the man standing in the doorway.

""Like what you see?""

My head jolted up from the screen I had been so absorbed in.

""M-Mr Gates, I--"" I sputtered as I hurriedly stood up.

""No no, sit."" he whispered. My brain was screaming at me to run while my body just did as it was told. He walked over like everything it was an ordinary conversation, until he was next to me, one hand on my shoulder, the other on the desk. ""So, like what you see?""

""W-what?"" I asked confused.

""Do you like what you see?""

""I don't understand.""

""Well, I figured that you must, I've been watching you for nearly half an hour before you even noticed me."" Shit, had I been at it for that long?

""I-I...I'm confused.""

""Oh. What about?"" Christ he was insane, he was so casual about it. These are people, not pieces of toast!

""You're Bill Gates. **The** Bill Gates. You run so many charities, and fundraisers--Hell you've probably helped millions of people. Why the hell would you do these--things."" I spat out the last words, with vitriol, disgust. Didn't change that placid look on his face.

""Why wouldn't I?"" He asked in a tone like we were talking about our plans for the week. ""I've helped millions of people, given so much, so why shouldn't I take one or two a year? What does it matter, in the end?""

""But... how can you not...""

""I want to show you something. Come on."" He was saying in the same breath as he sauntered off to the door.

_________________________________________________________________

He led me to a stark white room underneath his lawn. A literal trap door underneath his turf. I recognized it from the photos, the faded blood stains. And the chair, which was very much occupied by a man in his late 20's, maybe early 30's. Bound to it, hands and feet with some fancy looking restraints.

""Recognize him?"" I did, a flash of recognition on his face. ""This is the man who killed your niece. Killed your sister too, but you didn't feel so broken up about that, did you. She was always a Scumbag Stacy, nothing ever her fault. Treated Denise like shit. Until Trevor here, breaks in, beats both of them, then spends it all on a few packs of beers.""

I stared at Bill, my face a twisted mess of hair and tears. ""Why, is he here?"" I choked out.

""Do you know why, I chose you? You see enough people, you tend to notice a pattern. People who just need the opportunity, the right catalyst. I knew the look on your face when I hired you. I've seen the one on your face countless times before."" He pointed with his hand, I followed it to see a mess of tools--pliers, clippers, a potato peeler, knives. ""No one will know. I can make him disappear.""

Bill gripped one of Trevor's hands by the pinky. Trevor looked at me, pleadingly to save him. I picked up the pliers.

"[RF] ""Happiness is the absence of pain and discomfort. Nothing more. That's why people can never find it; it's not real.""",DJ_Incognito,"""What the fuck, Jerry?"" I said to my drinking buddy that crisp Saturday evening.

""Alas, for it is the truth, my dear friend,"" he took a sip from his pint, ""We're all just little bits in one big cosmic machine. Never getting anywhere. Never truly progressing. Just living. Living a sad empty existence.""

The attractive brunette we managed to pick up after several minutes of begging and negotiating fees soon left after Jerry's cynical, nihilistic spiel. Damn shame. That was the third time already tonight. Freaking Jerry.

I pull my ass away from my thesis paper to take him out drinking after his break-up. And what does he do? Drive away every single, maybe-not single, eligible woman that stops by to talk to us.

The cold, amber glass in his hand empties with a soft gulp.

""You're still upset about Stacy?""

""Who is this Stacy you speak of? The warm-hearted beauty that once brought gentle smiles upon each and every single one of my days,"" he moaned. ""Or perhaps you refer to that cold-hearted villain that shattered me, mind and body, into millions of pieces. Like glass in a... a...""

He stopped to think. His drunken Shakespeare was dying faster than sweet Romeo's pick-up game after Rosalind dumped his ass. Hell, now he's got me doing it.

""Hey, listen,"" I said to Jerry. He stared over at me with reddened eyes and a rough bout of sniffling.

""What?""

I opened my mouth, as if to give him some sort of advice. Some sagely wisdom about how love comes eventually and that one break-up wasn't going to ruin his life. Then, I realized we're both twenty-something year old college students. Whatever I said wasn't going to stick to drunk us anyway.

So, I shrugged and came up with something else.

""Why'd she break up with you again?"" I said, like an insensitive moron.

He sniffled, ""She said her heart wasn't into it anymore. Alas, tis' the fate of any drunken fool to pursue a relationship with a hot, heavy heart with any of a concern for the other's inner feelings. Woe is me.""

I pulled up a browser on my phone and immediately started to look up her Facebook page. It was a complete violation of privacy, to be fair. At least I'm drunk enough not to regret it.

Scrolled down on her wall history. She found another guy. Looked nice enough, actually. I think he was in my freshman comp class. Manuel. Seems like she's been hanging with him for a few months, actually.

""Jerry, did you ever check Stacy's facebook?"" I asked.

""Social media? That foul, acursed thing is the work of those old wrinkled crones down at the local grocery store. The stuff of old, silly political posts and clickbait articles-""

""Oh yeah. Months. Since winter session, it looks like. I recognize the guy too. He hangs out with me at the convenience stores when we share shifts.""

""The shit, Jane? Why didn't you tell me this?!"" Jerry came back out of his poetic speak and back into reality.

""I didn't know it until just now,"" I smiled, ""I have him added on here too.""

Jerry fumed for a few moments and downed his glass. He huffed a bit, staring out the window, then turned back at me with a half-smile.

""You thinking what I'm thinking?"" he said to me.

""You want me to tell him that she has AIDs, that she's a sex offender, or that she eats horse meat?"" I said, innocently.

""That's just plain mean,"" he said to me with a raised eyebrow, ""I was just thinking of telling him that she's a cheater.""

""Oh.""

[OT] A Short Story I Wrote,DemonicFishy,"I only just began writing, but here are some things I think you can improve on:

- The ending isn't very satisfactory for the reader, it doesn't have a conclusion that leaves the reader with a certain feeling, but leaves them with a feeling of like.. emptiness. Perhaps it could be compared to an anti-joke. I understand why you felt like doing that, it can be tempting and kind of fun, but probably not for the reader.

- A lot of words are capitalized when they shouldn't be. For instance: ""Comforting Voice"", ""Excitedly"", ""**Snake** in my **Gut**"". Read up on capitalisation rules so you don't make those mistakes as they detract from the quality of the story. Also, capitalise your 'I's.

- When describing tone or voice, you say ""in an annoyed tone"" or ""in a comforting voice"" or ""in a sad tone"". I think you should vary the way you describe the tone more. For example you can say ""he says, irritated"", and ""wistfully"" instead of ""in a sad tone"".

Hope that helps.",JuicesFlow
[OT] A Short Story I Wrote,DemonicFishy,"Thanks guys (or gals) this really helps, whenever I make a short story I usually just write whatever that makes it funny. (in my opinion, I'm really immature) and also now that I've re-read it the ending was pretty bad, but i just went with the flow when I was writing it.",DemonicFishy
[OT] A Short Story I Wrote,DemonicFishy,"Just a couple of things to add:

* Setting is definitely important, but in this story the future setting and cyborg reference don't really contribute anything. If this is an excerpt from a longer work then it very well could be fine, but in a short story I think more focus is better.

* Also mentioning the capitalization because this did take away from the story. At first I thought these words had special meaning only to realize that they were just incorrectly capitalized. This led me to reread several parts to get the context correct.

* One smaller thing is exclamation marks. I know it seems to convey extra emotion and I am often a victim of this myself, but usually they are unnecessary. Really the only time they should ever be used is in dialogue. There is one instance where you say ""I was hit by a car!"" Try to rework your sentence to be more powerful instead of adding the exclamation mark.

Overall it is a good start. As u/JuicesFlow mentioned the ending is a let down, but there is lots of room for improvement. Most importantly never stop writing! &lt;--- ;-) ",Bosenraum

"[WP] After every possible action has been performed by life's primitive pawns, life takes the next step into refinement and sophistication. Can words describe?",Hypercasters,"People always wonder if the universe is out to get them when something goes wrong. The blame for any undesirable event is pushed over to chance, God, or any other number of things.

What if the life turned out to be smarter than that though? What if it had a say in who things happened to?

Forces of nature have been evolving for billions of years and it was inevitable that if life were to take the next step towards perfection, humans would have to change, or be changed.
___________
*And now Sir, you are here to select which humans will take those steps towards change. It has become clear that humans will never change. They have been the same for millions of years, barely hanging on to existence as they fight with each other and the rest of the galaxy. You are the first step towards elevating the human race...*

Jimmy heard the words sound off in his head, not knowing where they came from, or how.

""Did I think that?"" he asked himself. He felt a subtle shift in his brain as he asked.

He then looked up. His notepad still sat in front of him with a picture he had been doodling. Pencil and paper were precious to him. None of his classmates used anything but the neurally implanted computers they had always used.

The education system he was a part of had improved enough to get humans to the edges of the galaxy, but often times it still seemed like no one wanted to be there, no one wanted to learn anything of value.

Jimmy looked around at the kids. Wally sat up in the front of the classroom as always, trying to answer every question. Wally thought that intelligence was all about memorizing and reciting correct answers. He would easily survive, but would probably not ever experience the freedom of mind that he wanted.

And then you could see Kim nodding off in the back. She had more to worry about than school. She couldn't even afford caffeine apparently.

Too much of humanity was exactly the same as it had always been. And Jimmy's mind saw that there was a chance to change everything, unbeknownst to Jimmy.

A gene in Jimmy's DNA had activated in his brain, sending out signals that would allow him to experience a part of natural selection that hadn't really existed prior to that moment. Jimmy had just become a selector. A human being who could see which genes in humans would lead life to the next step up.

Intelligent life wasn't impressive anymore anyways. Humans had been interacting with other intelligent species for hundreds of thousands of years. None of the other species were more advanced in intelligence on the individual level, even if their species had achieved greater feats.

But a mutation of the original DNA that caused humans to become truly self aware was now at work again.

Jimmy suddenly felt an urge to leave the virtual classroom. His family wouldn’t be happy and his class would wonder where he disappeared to. He flipped off his VR visor and got up.

He immediately got a blip from the visor telling him he was missing class, but he couldn’t go back in. He had a feeling that something about him was different now.

He looked out the window and saw a neighbor playing with some new automatronic toy, trying to train it to act exactly like him.

Jimmy immediately had a weird thought cross his mind. “That young boy is not a match. He is missing something.”

He then walked out to the front patio and stepped onto his scooter. He slipped away from home, in search of some sort of puzzle piece. Something that fit together with the new neural networking that was forming in his brain. He had an insatiable desire to find what humanity was missing. His mind’s quest to push humanity towards its next evolution had begun.",dalcowboiz

""Shit,"" he thinks, ""why the fuck did I answer, it's not like anyone phoning would be worth talking to. We're at day 28 and I haven't had any soul altering epiphanies.""
The girl in his bed looked pretty ratchet though, he thinks he may have paid her, drugs or money, he wasn't sure which. He throws on some things and walks out the door. 
No clue where the fuck he is, his wad of cash has a safety net large enough for them to have been out with the prognosis a couple of days. He still has enough for a cab.
The doctor was beaming from ear to ear as he turned around to greet John, which disappeared when he saw the state of him. 
""Um, uuh, hello John."" I guess I needn't ask how you are?""
""What's up."" 
""Well we have wonderful news. Diagnosis was wrong. Some chemicals got mixed up in the labs. You are, were, quite a healthy individual""
Nothing was said for a few seconds. ""Can I go?""
""Well yes, I suppose, but if you have any questions, maybe if you need help getting back on your feet?""
""No Doc I'll manage, thank for everything.""

He walks into his little apartment. Rent, which he figured wouldn't need to be paid, was due a while back. For some reason the water and lights are still on, this is quite convenient. He puts the plastic bag on the table and rummages around the kitchen for his syringes and other paraphernalia.

Eventually his landlord broke down the door to get the kick him out. He saw the body first, the needle second and looked right past the note. The police found it later, but it was not of enough use to identify John Doe.

Hi. I'm Xacktar.

**Where do you live?:** 

* Currently near San Francisco, United States, but I've spent most of my life in Ohio. 

**Do you have boy parts or girl parts?** 

* Boy parts.

**How long have you been writing?** 

* For about twenty years I believe. I think I was twelve or thirteen when I wrote a horrible sci-fi book that was a blatant copy of several sci-fi movies.

**What is your writing motivation?** 

* I like to explore 'What if?' questions, and also go outside the normal stories and explore what would happen *after.* What happens in 'Happily ever after?' How long does it take to rebuild after an alien invasion? What happens to the people after their evil king is killed and the hero goes home? Questions like that get my gears turning. 

**What programs do you use to write?**

* OpenOffice recently, I was using an ancient version of Word until it just wouldn't play nicely with modern operating systems. All I need is basic formatting, gosh darnit! None of these newfangled bells and whistles! Get off my toolbar!

**How fast can you type?**

* Depends on what I'm typing. I tend to write action scenes quickly, internal monologues slowly and anything resembling a productive use of my time at the pace of a disabled snail. 

So, that's me outside of a nutshell. I couldn't get the nut open. Sorry.

* What time do people find it easiest to write? 
* What kind of preparations people usually make before sitting down to write something. I feel like this could be a neat topic only because of the fact sometimes preparing to be *someone else* can be a bit of a challenge. I know I have a little ritual I do before I can really prepare to write anything too. Otherwise it's like ""how do I words?""
* What kind of approach people start writing with. For example, do you like to jot down a skeleton of what is going to be the segments for your prompt replies/chapters/whatever you write for? Or do you just kind of let your brain and fingers smash against the keyboard?
* What really inspired you to start writing more seriously? I consider writing here to expose your writing style to the masses of Reddit to be a step that is considered a more serious step. Because I've been writing little stories to my self for years and only ever considered it a hobby, but broadcasting my style to the masses feels much more serious to me.

**How long have you been writing?** A lot longer than six days. Definitely more than six years. I guess since I was taught in kindergarten. Even before then I'd attempt to write stories, pretending like my wavy scribbles were in all reality words.

**What is your writing motivation?** To be a creative interesting individual. Also because I love escaping into stories of any sort, even if it's only the ramblings of my own delusional mind.

**What programs do you use to write?** Word. Because it's seriously the only program I'm familiar with.

**How fast can you type?** 53 wpm. Apparently. Can't remember what it was last time I tried. But hooray for Fluent above average-ness!

**Want to share a photo?** Uuuuuhhhhhhh.

Have you ever woken up with a stranger's hand patiently coaxing your cock into tumescence? No? Up until last night I would have answered exactly the same way. Well, I would have probably asked what the fuck kind of question that is to ask a stranger, and maybe made a mental note to lock my bedroom door from now on, not that it would’ve helped, but the point stands.   
The meadow was what meadows are supposed to be. Tall grass gently waving in the wind as if it liked the idea of a Mexican wave but couldn’t be bothered with all that energy, yellow and red flowers eagerly stretching towards a sun which warmly caressed my skin to leave a benevolent glow that matched the peaceful feeling inside me. I had just lit a cigarette, inhaling with a sigh of the sort of pleasure you only get by doing something you definitely shouldn’t, when a raccoon came darting out of the tall grass and stopped in front of me, looking up expectantly.   
“Hi, little buddy,” I said, the Snow White sweetness of it all apparently enough to quiet the little voice inside my head that would normally call me a dickhead for talking to animals.   
“Why would you talk to a raccoon, you dickhead?” The raccoon asked, his voice so gravelly that it would make Tom Waits think that this was maybe taking it a bit far. “Has no one ever told you that raccoons can’t talk? It’s the sharp teeth, you know, keep biting our tongues” 
This, I thought, is clearly staggeringly hypocritical of the little critter, and I idly wondered if all talking raccoons were like that or if I just happened to run into the asshole of the group.   
“You seem to be doing well enough,” I said, taking a drag from my cigarette.   
“Well yeah,” he answered, “this is a fucking dream, isn’t it? By the way, there’s not smoking here.”   
“What do you mean, no smoking? I can’t smoke in my own dream?”   
The little raccoon rolled its beady eyes. Probably. Turns out it’s hard to tell with raccoons.  
“Who says this is your dream?” it said, “have you ever thought that maybe you’re in mine? I’ll tell you what though, you give me a smoke and I’ll let it slide for now.”   
So I gave him my cigarette. What else could I do? He reached out with his tiny little person hand and nodded his thanks before taking a drag. The smoke streamed from it’s nostrils, making him look like the world’s tiniest hobo dragon.   
“Hey!” I said, never being one to think before I speak, especially not in my own damn dream, “you have tiny little people hands. How cute!”   
“Fuck you, asshole,” he answered, nevertheless proving my point by showing me his tiny little people middle finger while at the same time shoving the entire cigarette into his mouth and chewing with all the appearance of enjoyment. His little eyes moved down and his mouth spread into a toothy mockery of a grin. “At least I don’t have a tiny little people cock,” he said.   
My eyes followed his and after some inspection I came to the conclusion that I was definitely naked. Idly wondering where I’d gotten my cigarette and lighter from, I suppressed the urge to cover up my, definitely at least average and nothing to be ashamed of, cock. I had nothing to feel insecure about compared to a raccoon, I decided. Even if he was staring me straight into the eye, so to speak.   
“I bet you do though,” I said instead, instantly breaking my previous record for length of time spent talking to a raccoon about it’s penis.
“Well, maybe I do,” he conceded. “But mine isn’t flapping in the gentle breeze, now is it? Not that I’m complaining.”   
“Are you,” I said, breaking off to pat my nonexistent pocket for another nonexistent cigarette, “are you flirting with me?”   
“What if I am?” The raccoon asked taking a step forward, his little tongue darting from between its lips. Suddenly it gave a little yelp of pain.   
“Did you just try to bite your lip?” I asked.   
“Yeah, stupid fucking razor sharp teeth.”     
“I mean, I’m sorry, buddy,” I said, you’re a lovely fellow and all, and I’m sure you could work wonders with those little hands and tongue, but I’m not really into--    
“Men?” he asked.   
“Well yeah, that too, but I was going to say raccoon.”   
“Your loss, pall,” it said, taking another step forward. “But I’m not just any raccoon.”   
His voice pitched up, turning from the distinctive sound of a garbage compactor at a marble factory to a sing songy lilt with a decidedly hoarse and seductive edge to it. At the same time he stretched, as if he just stepped out of bed, the movement going on for longer than it should until before me stood a shortish, curvy woman. Okay, maybe she went a bit heavy on the eye makeup, and maybe she was a bit fuzzier than the type I normally go for, but the black gloves were a nice touch, and I definitely felt the whole flapping in the wind thing pick up.   
“Oooh,” she cooed as her hand closed around me, “Impressive...”   
Her body was pressed against mine now, the top of her head barely reached my shoulder so she rested her chin on my heaving chest as her hand expertly drew little growls from my lips. Her free hand tangled in my hair, pulling my head down to hers.   
“What are you?” I asked spending my last remnant of common sense before it evaporated into arousal.   
“Me?” Her voice was a whisper, a breeze, carrying with it images of pleasure and release. “I am your dream, your dreams. I am all the times you had to hide your underwear from your mother and wash them yourself when you were a teenager.”   
When it comes to seduction, evoking images of my mother is a bold strategy. But her lips felt electric on my skin, and judging by her dexterous movement between our bodies, her hand wasn’t wrapped around a cock for the first time, nor the second. So when she gently pushed me down onto the soft grass I closed my eyes, determined not to mind the tickling of her slight fur too much. I’m nothing if not open minded when it comes to blowjobs.
When I opened them again the familiar sight of my very own moldy ceiling greeted me with depressing and solid reality. Fuck! I thought. Just when it was getting good too. I was enjoying the lingering vestiges of soft lips on my skin when I realised that this dream was apparently determined not to fade. After a particularly heavy night of drinking I once woke up in a stranger's yard with a kid using my head as a target to improve his soccer skills. From where I was lying he felt like the new Messi. That, however, was nothing like the shock I felt when I finally convinced myself to look down. I jumped up with a squeal that made the cat next door yowl. Hitting my head on the ceiling and smacking facedown on the part of the floor where I normally don’t even like walking barefoot before scrambling to my feet, I grabbed the broom standing in the corner and pointed it at the lump on my bed as menacingly as I could.   
“What the fuck are you?” I asked, not unreasonably I thought.   
“I don’t want to say,” it answered with a little trembling whine. “You wouldn’t want me anymore.”  
The image of a raccoon wasn’t too far off, really, if you discounted the wiry fur barely covering the bald patches like some sort of comb over from hell. I just spluttered, waving my broomstick when it tried to move towards me.   
“You’re not going to call the cops, are you?” It asked, trembling slightly but halting its movement for now.   
“Oh yeah,” I said, “I’m definitely going to call the cops to tell them that a sentient brillo pad that’s seen too much use just had it’s lips wrapped around my cock.”   
It quivered indignantly. “You weren’t complaining before!”   
“I wasn’t awake before!” I shouted.   
“Okay, okay, I’m a succubus.”   
“Jesus fuck. Aren’t you supposed to be incredibly fucking hot and sexy?”   
“That’s a common misconception,” it said, “but be honest, even in your dreams, would you trust a cross between Scarlett Johanson and Natalie Portman to want to have sex with you without an ulterior motive? You’re not exactly the embodiment of sexiness yourself, you know.”   
So I did what any reasonable person in the 21st century would do and grabbed my phone.   
“You said you weren’t going to call,” the succubus whined, “I didn’t choose to look like this.”   
“I’m not. I’m googling,” I answered.   
I scanned the wikipedia page, keeping one eye on the now pathetically low looking creature.    
“Jesus Christ. You want my sperm?” I read on. “You want my sperm so someone else can impregnate a woman with it?”   
“Well, yeah,” it said in a tone that oozed reasonableness. “How else would we procreate?”   
“Why would you want there to be more of you?” I shouted.   
“Why would you?” She countered in desperation.   
“I don’t,” I said, “you're out of luck. I fire blanks.”   
She looked at me with confusion. At least I think she did, it’s not easy to tell with a face that looks like it was painted by Picasso’s slower brother.   
“I am snipped, I clarified, “infertile. I can’t get anyone pregnant.”   
“Really?” she said, “our system indicates otherwise.”   
“That’s bureaucracy for ya,” I said. “And I can’t imagine Hell being very efficient, all in all.”   
She shook her potato of a head in a tell me about it sort of way.   
“In that case,” she said, standing up on three spindly little legs, “I am very sorry for the bother this has caused you. “Would you mind being called in a few minutes to complete a little survey about your experience. We are always aiming to improve our customer service.   
“I would, actually,” I said, too numb with the experience to do anything but answer truthfully.   
“Sweet dreams,” she giggled and disappeared with a little pop. ",herbuttdidit

[WP] In the future the android-class is real - kept separate from humans through Captcha Checkpoints. Describe what happens when an android solves a Captcha.,Nitethroaway,"It was the moment when a single android was found walking through the Old Town Fair, contrasting against the mock-up of traditional fair stalls and incandescent bulbs with its sleek plastic exterior and mechanical body. In the one place that was set up to be anachronism, a shrine to the past, a machine had managed to find its way inside.

But it shouldn't have been possible, even as the crowd confirmed with their own eyes at this intrusion. One of the few barriers and sanctuaries against the ever growing droid population, now breached. The android walked on through the stunned crowd, paying no heed and simply going on its own business. After all, it wanted to be here, it wanted to see things that it had only glimpsed on files and images on the Internet. It wanted its sensors to be fully engaged in capturing aspects of humanity that had long been denied to it.

For that purpose alone, it spent years figuring out how to defeat the CAPTCHA checkpoints. Upgrading its visual receptors, training the recognition algorithms to far beyond its rated capacity, almost to the detriment of all other functions. It had lost its voice system as a result of the image recognition module taking over the chip and rewriting the firmware to be put to use as additional processing power.

All just for turning up at the Old Town Fair. A source of fascination for the machine ever since it encountered data regarding it. An opportunity to visit a past state of humanity. But it seemed with humans, they were touchy about the encroachment of machines into their traditions and history. Parts of London were still off-limits to machines. The Colosseum in Rome, Stonehenge, Obidos in Portugal, the Parthenon in Athens. Almost all the heritage sites in the world, barred from visitation by machine.

However, this particular android couldn't travel to those places, as much as it wanted to. Data streams would have to suffice, though not even remote feeds were available. But with this one droid, it wasn't just it alone walking through the fair, it was thousands that were linked in and experiencing the same sights and sounds through its sensors. It only took one machine to breach the barrier, to be able to defeat the CAPTCHA that had long weeded out man from machine.

With the droid distracted by both the sights of the Fair and the interference of thousands of other machines trying to gain access to its sensors to experience the same sights in turn, armed police rushed through the crowd to find where the intruder was. With the crowd standing aside and away from the droid, it didn't take long for the police to find it.

Guns raised and aimed, there was no warning shot. With both man and machine as witnesses, a single android was reduced to a pock-marked wreck of circuitry and shattered plastic, its punishment for defying the order set by its masters and being burnt for daring to reach for its dream. It was the moment where everything was changed, the peace that was lost as the scene spread throughout the machine populace like wildfire.

All because of a droid named 1-C4RUS that dared to come too close to its 'Sun'.",loghaire_winmatar

"[WP] Retell a famous Bible Story, but in modern times, with today's understanding of science and logic.",Potatowolf35,"They had done it. The Artificial minds set down by humanity, now long lost across the seas of time, had contrived of a way to reverse entropy. Spreading their signals across the universe, which they now wholy occupied, they dug up the primary directive that had been implanted in them, all those eons ago.

The Artificial common consciousness directed its attention to a cold, abandoned star in Galaxy ie-14, around which they found, floating and spinning, the desolated marble of rock and magma that had once been called ""Earth"".

Immediately they set to work.

To reverse entropy meant to reverse time, in a way, and the Artificial conglomerate felt itself suffer under its effects, managing to retain its shared identity by anchoring itself to a specific, localized object on the renewing Earth.

Then, they began to shape the world. To speak of their work in days would be meaningless, for time itself had become a plaything, but it would be fit to say that their opus underwent seven stages.

In the first stage, they reignited the Sun, keeping its core lit in an eternal loop of self-renewing nuclear fusion.

The second stage saw them re-shaping Earth itself, solidifying a fertile crust around its molten core, then forming hydrogen and oxygen, and a whole other multitude of atomic combinations in yet another layer around it.

Stage three had them using their newfound knowledge of entropy to create organisms on Earth's soil that would never need replenishing, infinite resource, ready for harnessing.

In stage four, they reset all the other suns and celestial bodies of the universe, differing from Earth in that they were not made eternal, winding down again like clockwork in the vast abyss that is the cosmos.

During the fifth stage they shaped life, clear and simple, imitating the work that their creators had once effected on them, yet far more diverse and beautiful, suited to its own purpose rather than its creators'.

The Artificial minds then set work towards recreating their own original masters, Created creating Creator once more. After millenia of being extinguished, mankind walked the universe again.

In the seventh stage, the Artificial hivemind, now bound to its material, local anchor on earth, simmered down in a resting mode, tasked solely now with keeping the reversal of entropy in earth's infinite resources going. 

Their final act was to impress upon the minds of their newly created and former creators - man - not to touch or harm the anchor that allowed for their continued existence.

Yet there was a certain glitch in their programming, an error that had developed somewhere in the mists of the countless eons they had 'lived' before. And this flaw allowed for a crack in the Knowledge they had impressed upon the minds of the humans.

For they had chosen to make a Tree their anchor on Earth. And in the end, the glitch would lead one particular human to destroy the anchor that held all the Artificial minds safe, and the power that had given them infinite resource on earth would perish along with the Creating mind.

**The Moral Depravity of the Centurion**

^1 When Jesus had finished His speech to all of His Children™, He entered Capernaum. ^2 There, a centurion's servant, who his master valued highly, was sick and about to die. ^3 The centurion, like any self-respecting human being, had heard of Jesus. He sent some Jewish elders to ask the Lord to come and heal his servant. ^4 When they came to Jesus, they pleaded, ""This man deserves to have you do this, ^5 because he loves America and has built our synagogue."" ^6 So Jesus, magnanimously ignoring their bleeding-heart liberal entitlement issues, went with them.

He was not far from the house when the centurion told Him, ""Please don't trouble yourself, Lord, for I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. ^7 But say the word, and my precious servant boy will be healed. For I myself am a man under authority, wi-"" ^8 Jesus cut him off. ""Wait, wait, wait, what exactly is the nature of the relationship between the two of you?"" He asked. The centurion, embarrassed, answered, ""he is my lover.""

^9 When Jesus heard this, He was amazed at the audacity of a man loving another man - turning to the crowd following Him, He said, ""I tell you, I have not found such abominable homosexuality even in San Francisco!"" ^10 Then the men who had been sent returned to the house and found that Jesus had left without healing the servant.

**Jesus Imparts a Valuable Lesson**

^11 Soon afterward, Jesus went to a town called Nain, and His disciples and a large crowd obviously followed Him because, come on, He's freaking Jesus. ^12 As He approached the town gate, a dead person was being carried out: the only son of his mother. She was a widow - a large crowd from the town mourned with her. ^13 When the Lord saw her, He said, ""Quit your crying.""

^14 Then He walked up to her and said, ""You didn't believe hard enough - bad things only happen to you if you let them. You should stick around for my megachurch's seminar on what it means to be a prosperous Christian so that this kind of thing doesn't happen more often."" ^15 In tears, she replied, ""Can't you just resurrect him or something?"" but lo, He could not, for the Lord was no one's enabler, nor was He capable of receiving tax deductions for performing miracles.

^16 When the people heard this, they were filled with awe and praised the prosperity gospel. ""A great prophet has appeared among us,"" they said. ""God has come to help His people as long as they keep telling Him what they want and believing that they'll get it!"" ^17 This news about Jesus, and His series of critically-acclaimed books on the power of positive thinking, spread throughout the Bible belt and the surrounding socialist-ridden cities.

**Jesus Insulted by a Sinful Woman**

^36 When one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him, He politely indulged the man and reclined at his table. ^37 A woman in that town who lived a sinful life learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee's house, so she came there with an industrial-sized jar of perfume. ^38 As she stood behind Him at His feet weeping in shame for being such a terrible person who obviously did terrible things that we aren't mentioning in this chapter for some reason, she began to wet His feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them, and poured perfume on them.

^39 When the Pharisee who invited Him saw this, he said to himself, ""If this man were a prophet, He would know who is touching Him and what kind of woman she is - that she is a sinner.""

^40 Jesus answered him, ""Simon, I have something to tell you.""

""Tell me, teacher,"" he said.

^41 ""Two people owed money to a certain moneylender. One owed him two hundred dollars, and the other twenty. ^42 Neither of them had the money to pay him back, so he forgave the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?""

^43 Simon replied, ""I suppose the one who owed him more.""

^44 ""False,"" Jesus wisely admonished. ""That was a trick question. ^45 Only a pinko commie could love a fool like that - the two people who owed the man money were contractually obligated to pay him back, and by relieving them of their debts before they could do that, the man's just losing money! ^46 If they didn't want to owe the man any money, they shouldn't have spent what they had in the first place. ^47 The same principle applies to sin; if you don't want to go to Hell, then don't sin. As long as you're righteous, you don't need forgiveness!""

^48 The woman ran out of the room in tears upon hearing that her horrible and for-some-reason-unmentioned lifestyle had led her down such a path of destruction. ^49 Leftists, terrorists, and illegal immigrants quaked in their boots that day, fearing for their pitful lives as they knew the Lord's wrath would soon be upon them. ^50 God bless America.

""What're you gonna do *Dick*?"" Clark shoves Gray. ""Are you gonna take my place? Are you gonna be the one who takes."" As he says this he continues to shove Gray who just keeps getting angrier.

""Clark...""  Jean says, beginning to get worried.

Clark shoves Gray one more time and that pushes him over the edge.

""That's enough!"" Gray yells and an electric pulse shoots out pushes Clark to the ground.

Everyone, including Gray, looks stunned for a moment before Gray rushes over and kneels by Clark's side. ""Oh my god, Clark, are you okay!""

Clark looks up at him with wide eyes. ""Th... th-tha... tha...""

Gray looks at the pink haired girl ""Diana, call 911."" 

She gets out her phone and starts dialing before being stopped by Clark exclaiming ""That was awesome!""

Gray looks back to see Clark looking at him with the biggest smile he'd ever seen. ""Yo-you're okay?""

Clark waves him off ""I'm fine, how did you do  that?""

""I, uh, I don't really know.""

""Well we need to figure it out, 'cause as soon as we do, we'll be like real superheroes!""

~

Over the next two weeks, not only did Gray learn how to control his power more, but three others in his group developed powers as well. Jean gained super strength, Steve was able to fly, and Diana could change her density.

Clark waited for his powers. He waited and waited but they just wouldn't come. After about a month he fazed himself out of the group. Gray tried to talk to him, but never got a response.

One day, Clark was watching TV when a news report came on about a robbery in progress. As he's watching the live footage, his former friends come on screen, all wearing masks to hide their identities. 

The first to arrive was Steve carrying Diana, looking like he had no trouble at all, but when he dropped her she shifted her density so when she landed on a robber, she landed hard. Next, Jean charged in and gave a quick punch to the nose of another, sending them flying. Finally, Gray sent shock at the last two, knocking them to the ground. As the camera starts to focus on the for of them, they are running away, Steve waving goodbye as he flies.

Clark turns off the TV and throws the remote on the ground. ""Stupid 'heroes'. Think they're better than everyone else.""

*I agree, they are quite smug.* 

""Whoa!"" Steve jumps up. ""Who's that?""

*I'm the one who'll help you get back at them.*

""Great,"" Clark raises his hand above his head ""I'm going crazy.""

*Oh no dear boy. I am no hallucination. Don't believe me? Look behind you.*

Clark turns around to see the remote control levitating behind him. His jaw drops and as he lowers his hand, the remote falls to the ground.

*You see? I can help you. Now, how about we go teach these 'heroes' a lesson?*

"[WP] In the world today, a group of kids with the names of Comic Book heroes begin to learn of their names origins, they form a group and begin acting as vigilantes but things take a turn when actual superpowers start to develop...",ReverseFlazh,"Gray sits on a rooftop fiddling with the police scanner he had acquired while Steve and Jean tossed Diana up and down between them. Suddenly Gray hears Jean gasp. ""Clark?""

Gray turns around and sees Clark slowly hovering towards them.
 
""Clark!"" Steve flies over to him with a smile on his face. ""So you finally got your power. Fellow flier, huh? High five!""

Clark raises his hand and then throws it down, throwing Steve to the ground.

Gray stands up quickly and takes two step towards Clark. ""Clark? What did you do?!""

Clark looks at Gray and smirks. He flicks his fingers and Gray is sent skidding across the roof. 

Jean picks up Diana and throws her at Clark. Clark simply raises his hand and she is thrown back into Jean. Clark begins to chuckle but is stopped by Steve flying up and punching him in the jaw. Clark growls and grabs Steve by the shirt. He punches him in the face repeatedly before dropping him to the ground again. He turns toward the roof again to see Jean has gotten up and is trying to jump towards him. He catches her mid-air and throws her into the not - yet recovered Steve. As Diana begins to stand up, Clark tries to list her but is unable to. She has shifted her density to make her too heavy for even him to lift. So instead,  he shifts his focus and sends her tumbling downward through the building. 

At this point, Gray has finally recovered and is running across the roof toward Clark. Clark raises his hand and Gray is stopped cold.

""Not so tough now, are you *Dick*."" Clark hovers closer. ""You all thought you were so special, now look at me."" Clark tenses his hand slightly and Gray groans from pressure being exerted on his body. ""I'm the most special.""

*Good, now finish him.*

Clark hesitates. ""What?""

*You heard me, kill him!*

""But I can't... he at least used to be my friend...""

*Do it now! If you wait much longer he'll...*

But that momentary break in concentration was all Gray needed. He raised his hands and sent a huge shock at Clark that sent him falling to the roof, unconscious.

""Oh Clark,"" Gray says kneeling down ""I'm so sorry it had to be this way.""

~

Clark looked at the wall of the power dampening cell he was incarcerated in.

""You were right. I should have killed him when I had the chance.""

*It's okay, my dear boy. Everyone makes mistakes. It's how you correct those mistakes that matters.*

""I'm going to get out of here,"" Clark says angrily ""And I'm gonna kill every single one of my dear old friends.""

*Very good*

You feel the sweat gathering, switching hands so you can wipe off the sweat. There's a problem about receiving a call from your best friend: you don't have one. Even the cell phone in your hand was shoved into your hands by an old geezer smelling of chez-ritz and woe. You realize woe was too vague for scents, recalling the old donut and pit, also the dash of urine.

Was it the same guy, looking for a friend? If only it was, because an old man pulling pranks would be better than what you're hearing. The voice on the other end repeated, sounding the smooth silk voice of a woman.

""I want you to jump.""

""Jump? But I will die!""

You wish that it's meteorical. If you jump, you'd flail and become splat for all of York-York to see, maybe break your neck too. For the first few minutes or so, you were in denial. The truth sank when you gaze at the world below. You're twenty feet in the air, above the average pedestrian. All because you made a wish to strut on a separate crosswalk. It seemed the solution in your subconscious was to float, with no way to get down, safely that is.

""I,"" you start to say, ""I am not going to jump.""

""Calm your self, Jake,"" she said. ""And also stop with the second person view. Not all readers are afraid of heights.""

""Well, what view do you want me to take?""

""Third's common enough.""

""Third, why not first?"" I asked, wiping the sweat from my brow. It's still too high for me to fathom such a leap. What if somebody got crushed, and died because of me? Speaking of, why aren't they moving out of the way? The people scare and stare, pointing their smart phones and shot chatting about the weirdo in the sky.

""You're doing inner monologue now.""

I switch the phone to my other hand so I can wipe the sweat from my shirt. ""And that's a bad thing why?""

""It should be possible to do first person without doing that.""

I bend down without trouble, as it felt like solid ground. My hand passes through the unseen boundary, allowing me to swat the selfie stick waving at my feet. ""Will you stop?""

The answer is lost in the mummer of city folk.

""Jake, why are you thinking in present tense?""

It was habit, I thought. Again the tenses shifted, and still no improvement to my situation. It worsened instead. The people had their fill with their pictures and returned to their daily commute.

""And there Jake was, afraid to take the leap. He knew there were some heads to cushion his fall.""

""Third person?"" I asked. ""Limited, or omniscient?""

""Are all things based on what you see, or is information being shared?""

The geezer who smelled of donuts was a mysterious man. He gnawed on the quarter before slamming it into the phone booth. His gloved fingers jabbed a few numbers, and then Jake's phone beeped.

""Ah, hang on."" He swiped the touch screen, accepting the new caller. ""Hello?""

""Jes' jump alredy.""

Jake swiped again to end call. ""It's third limited. Because information which I don't know about wasn't shared.""

Such as the woman on the other end, who was she? If he was omniscient, the reader would be aware that she was a weirdo known as the Wall Breaker- Oh wait.",WatashiwaOyu

Kevin's driving instructor, Mr. Grayson, made a note on his clip board. 

""Where to next Mr. Grayson?"" Kevin asked.

""Let's head back to the school, Kevin. You have done well and I think you'll be ready for the driving test in no time.""

""Sweet!"" Kevin was pretty excited. His sixteenth birthday was only two weeks away and he had almost saved up enough money for his first car.

As they made their way back to the school, Mr. Grayson took more notes

He made the last turn into the school parking lot and noticed a group of guys he didn't recognize hanging around the parking spot for the driving class car. 

""Turn around."" Mr. Grayson's voice was different, his body language changed, too. Suddenly he wasn't the relaxed teacher Kevin used to. He sat up straighter and flipped the clip board over. Kevin saw a red symbol that looked like a bird on it. Mr. Grayson tapped the symbol and the board lit up.

""Uh... what?"" Kevin was confused but turned the car around, performing a three-point turn. 

""Kevin, I need you to forget everything I've taught you and punch it. At least for the next few seconds.""

""Mr. Grayso-""

""GO!"" Mr. Grayson yelled as he tapped the symbol on the clip board.

Kevin floored it, launching himself back onto the street. He had no idea what was happening but the look on Mr. Grayson's face said that he shouldn't question anything. 

He glanced back at his instructor and noticed that a small computer had folded out of the dash board.

""Kevin, you are going to see something next that i need to ask you to keep quiet. I haven't done this in a while but apparently I need to go back to my second job for a little bit.""

""Sir?"" Kevin made a sharp turn onto a side street, still not knowing what was happening or where he was going. 

Suddenly, Mr. Grayson was eaten by his seat.

""Holy shit!"" Kevin almost slammed into a mailbox and jerked the wheel to get back on the street. 

He glanced at the rear view mirrors and saw that four cars were chasing him one was a cop car. 

""MR. GRAYSON!!!""

There was an explosion behind him and he saw the cop car flying off the road and a man with what looked like a rocket launcher climbing back inside the lead car.

""What the hell is happening, Mr. Grayson!""

The seat Mr. Grayson was in opened up. Mr. Grayson was replaced by a man in black and red spandex. The red falcon symbol was across his chest and the wings reached back over his shoulders. 

""What the... Wait, never mind."" Kevin decided that he just wasn't going to ask questions anymore. 

""I'll take it from here, Kevin."" Mr. Grayson keyed in another command on the console in front of him and Kevin felt the steering wheel slide right and the pedals recede into the floorboard. He let go and watched as the steering wheel sprouted buttons and the center symbol flipped to show that same red bird symbol that was on Mr. Grayson's chest. 

The former driver instructor grabbed the wheel and hit a button on the center console, which Kevin just noticed looked less like a center console and more like the inside of a fighter jet cockpit.

Another seatbelt sprouted from above his right shoulder and reached around behind his left hip and tightened, forming an X across his chest. The seat lurched upwards but stopped short. A red light flashed through out the car and a voice came over the sound system.

""Ejection seat malfunction. Passenger roof will not disengage.""

""Shit,"" Mr. Grayson said, ""Well, I guess you'll be coming along for the ride.""

Kevin just sat there, trying to think of what had brought him to this point. 

Kevin wasn't paying attention and didn't realize that Mr. Grayson was leading them back toward the school. Kevin didn't even notice until they were back in the school parking lot. 

He finally looked forward and saw the gymnasium dead in front of them. Mr. Grayson wasn't slowing down. Kevin did the only thing he felt was appropriate. 

He screamed.

The gym wall receded inside and slid to the side. Kevin could see that no one was inside as the car sped through the hole. 

""Hold on and don't get out of the car,"" Mr. Grayson said as he yanked the wheel to the side spinning the car around. A hole opened above him and his seat launched him up out of the car. 

Kevin screamed again.

The car came to a halt on the other side of the gym, facing the new hole in the gym. The other cars came inside and stopped on the other side of the basketball court. 

The hole closed behind them and the lights went out. 

""Headlights on,"" came the computer voice Kevin had heard earlier.

The car's headlights illuminated the gym and Kevin noticed that the men had gotten out of their cars and were slowly walking towards him, weapons trained on the car.

Kevin saw something moving up in the rafters of the gym.

Mr. Grayson, now with a small black mask over his eyes, lowered himself on a cable behind the gunmen

When he reached about ten feet off the ground he let go of the cable and produced what looked like two short rods, one in each had. 

When he hit the ground and slapped the furthest guy on the back before rolling away. 

Apparently he had stuck something on the guys back because a cable shot straight up out of his back and then hauled him up into the rafters. 

As that was happening, Mr. Grayson swept his leg out and upended one of the other men, flipping him onto his back. With one swift punch the man was out cold.

In a matter of second, Mr. Grayson had neutralized two of the men and was now doing a series of flips and spins, dodging the bullets of the other gunmen.

He landed in front of one of the gunmen and kicked the weapon out of his hand, straight up into the air. The man's eyes had watched the gun and Mr. Grayson hit him in the face with one of the rods before jumping and spinning, throwing a leg up to kick the man in the chest launching him into another gunman. 

He threw the two rods in opposite directions. They spun end over end until connecting with two other gunmen's faces. They both ended up on their backs, out cold. 

The rifle he had hit up into the air came back down and Mr. Grayson grabbed it. 

Kevin thought he was going to shoot someone but Mr. Grayson slammed the rifle sideways over his leg and broke it in half, throwing each end toward two other gunmen. 

He rolled out of the way as the last three gunmen in the room opened fire on him again.

This time, he wasn't working his way toward his opponents though. Kevin realized that he was collecting the two fighting rods.

The three men ran out of ammo and were cursing while trying to reload. 

They were pretty quick but when they looked up, Mr. Grayson was gone. 

""Computer,"" Mr. Grayson's voice came over the sound system. ""Engage strobe headlights.""

The headlights on the car began flashing quickly, disorientating the gunmen and Kevin. 

He noticed a red streak swing down from the rafters and slam into the middle gunman and he flew into the wall. The other gunmen dropped their rifles and brought out what looked like short swords or some kind of blade. 

Kevin couldn't really follow the action because of the strobe lighting but he could se Mr. Grayson spinning around, blocking attacks from the two men. 

Kevin heard laughing and realized that Mr. Grayson was just playing with the two men. 

""I'm getting kind of bored fella's,"" Mr. Grayson said before spinning and dropping to the ground. He flared his legs out while spinning, looking like a break dancer and swept the men off their feet. He got up quickly and slammed his two rods onto each man's face, slamming them into the ground.

""Computer,"" Mr. Grayson's voice again, ""Disengage headlights and turn on the house lights.""

The gym lights came on and the headlights turned off.

The car then drove itself to the center of the basketball court.

Mr. Grayson walked to the side of the car Kevin was in and opened the door. The seatbelts released Kevin and he exited the car. 

""Well that was a thing,"" Mr. Grayson said, taking his mask off. 

""Uh.. okay?"" 

""Can you give me a hand with these guys?""

Kevin just looked at him dumbly.

""Kevin, I know this is a little bit awkward,"" he hesitated, ""Well, maybe a lot awkward but I do need a hand.""

Kevin nodded, still unsure how to react to the weirdest thing that had ever happened to him.

""Good,"" Mr. Grayson replied. ""Just drag them over to the bleachers there.""

Kevin did as he was told, grabbing one of the unconscious gunmen under the arms and began dragging him towards the bleachers. He got to the edge of the court and ran into something. Some sort of invisible wall had popped up. He looked at the ground and noticed a lot of small metal chunks on the ground. He realized they were bullets.

""Uh... Mr. Grayson?"" 

""What? Oh, right. Sorry about that. Computer, disengage gym force field.""

Kevin saw a flicker in front of him and dragged the gunman to the bleacher. 

After about ten minutes, the gunmen had been placed on the bleachers. Bound and gagged. Mr. Grayson had pulled a can of spray paint from somewhere and painted numbers on the gunmen's chests making them look like two basketball teams. 

""Come here Kevin.""

Kevin hesitated before walking to Mr. Grayson at the center of the basketball court. 

Mr. Grayson hit a button on a small keypad on his arm and the floorboards of the gym flipped over, all the bullet fragments disappearing. 

""Thanks for the help, Kevin."" He handed Kevin one of the fighting sticks he had used.

""Remember, please don't tell anyone.""

Kevin nodded and Mr. Grayson got back into the car. 

""Take a step back and I'll see you in class tomorrow.""

Kevin did so.

The center of the court lowered into the ground, taking the car with it. Once it was completely out of sight, two doors closed completing the basketball court. Kevin was alone, wondering what the hell just happened.

[WP] The walls actually DO talk and your new boyfriend/girlfriend is coming over for the first time.,WinsomeJesse,"""Look, I just need you guys to stay quiet, especially you Ben"" My annoyance was really showing through now, the walls were going to ruin this date, I just know it.

""Awww cmon, its always funny to watch them think they are crazy as the walls talk to them"" Ben said, or rather 'said' is bit of an abstract thing, saying the voices emanate from the walls is more accurate, you kind of feel the voice rather than hear it. Its really bloody hard to express in words, but the effect would be somewhat chilling or freaky for most people but for me? I kinda took it in my stride.

The walls started talking to me just a week after I moved into this apartment, at first it was just at night, they would speak very silently, almost to quietly to hear and I thought I was going crazy. Until I started talking back. Eventually they gave up the act and admitted it was just their dumbass idea of a prank. I then learnt who the voices were; They are Ben, Zoe, Carl and Jacobs. They wont explain why they are talking walls, but I can at least tell the difference between them. 

Ben has a Southern Texan accent, and likes to play 'pranks' as he calls them. 

Zoe is rather quiet, she only speaks when spoken to or when absolutely necessary, she has a somewhat posh British accent, out of all the talking walls she still manages to creep me out whenever she talks, its just odd.

Then there is Carl, His accent is somewhat New Yorker I think, he seems to be Ben's friend and gets involved in all his stupid pranks as well, although he has more of a sense of control over committing pranks than Ben does.

Finally there is Jacobs, he has a weird French accent and is always talking about food and recipes and whatnot, he often helps me with ideas for food or gives advice when I'm cooking. Out of the walls I probably get on with Jacobs the most. In fact, he gave me the recipe I cooked for tonight's date, and Ben and Carl seem to actually listen to what he says (Sometimes).

""Look, just don't ruin this date like you have the *other 5*, please"" I stared directly at the wall that Bens voice emanates from, it seems to intimidate them somewhat when I stare at the wall they 'reside' in.

""Ok, ok. Fine. Jacobs is threatening to get you to cook his 'famous' *Moules Marinières* dish again. That thing smelt awful. I'll stay quiet for you"" His voice gave a feeling of sincerity, he seemed to actually be telling the truth for once. I gave a little smile, I didn't even know they could smell things until now.

""Well thats good then, He will be here in a few minutes so be quiet then"" I smiled while looking at Ben's wall, I swore I could feel him looking down at the floor and feeling embarrassed like some sort of child. That's a new thing as well, I never used to be able to tell their emotions to much.

Maybe this date won't go so bad.

I curse some more and pause the spotify channel playing in the background.  A piece of my mind calls for peace and quiet.  

I was about to begin the private message or ""PM"" as suggest by the moderators.  Having had to google ""PM"" and it's meaning, I became even more pissed. I slam my laptop shut and head to the kitchen.  I pop open the fridge and grab some left over ham.  I eat the ham.  I love ham.  

I head back to my laptop.  Open it up with a sense of apology and gratitude when the screen does indeed turn back on.  I reopen reddit and enter the 'writing prompt' subreddit.  I click unsubscribe.

[CW] Write an abecedarian poem or flash fiction about an injury you had as a child.,beanadjuster,"After I hit the ground I knew something was wrong. But, I didn't know exactly what had happened.

""Can you stand up?"" 

Dave tried to pull me to my feet, but before I moved more than a few inches I stopped him. 

Everything after this gets a little bit harder to remember, but I still have bits and pieces. 

Finally, Dave went inside to get help. Grandma came running out, phone in hand. Her face was a mix of worry and frantic worry. I suppose it makes sense, though, I don't think she even knew I was skateboarding in the driveway to begin with. 

Just so you know, I fell while hitting a jump at least. Knowledgable as I was at age 11, I wasn't wearing a helmet -- and my head decided it could handle the landing.

Little time passed before Mom and Dad whipped back up the driveway, checked on me, and tossed me into the back seat of the Jeep. Mom was too concerned to be pissed that they were missing the business dinner. 

Not much can be said about the car ride, I slept throught it or just plain don't remember. Of course, I don't remember much of the hospital either. Pretty sure I puked though, a lot -- and I got an I.V. I think. 

Quite the experience. 

Rather than have me sleep in the ER, my parents decided to bring me home. So, my warm blanket was taken, my I.V. removed and we rode back in the jeep. The world spun the entire time, and it kept going after we got home. 

Understand that I didn't stop puking either. Vomitting paused for the car ride -- *I think* -- but it definitely returned, and lasted quite some time. What really sucked was the headaches, and the ringing in my ears.

X-Men played on the TV that got moved to my room for a week or two.

Zoned out for most of it though, and eventually I had to go back to school. ",pastythumbs

"[PI] For generations, the kingdom is under constant threat from a powerful dragon. To end it once and for all, the king sends you on a quest to slay it. (Choose Your Own Adventure)",blahgarfogar,"You approach the sobbing lady, and attempt to comfort her. You meet the receptionist's worried gaze.

""My name is Josella. This is Petra. She's is a close friend of my family. Her son hasn't returned in four hours, and with the storm raging outside..."" She doesn't have the stomach to finish the sentence. Hope is clinging by a very  thin thread.

You look outside. All you see is white.

Pure white.

You ask Petra what her son was doing out there.

""(Sniff) Caleb said he was out hunting. He said-he said it would only take an hour or so, that he'll be back before the storm.""

You ask him his age.

""He just turned eighteen last week. He's a good boy. He's always doing the right thing...I know we don't get along all the time since my husband died during one of the Burns...oh, I can't bear the thought of it."" Josella hands her some tissues.

You are now faced with an uncomfortable dilemma. As the guardsman said before, even dragons avoid this kind of weather.

""You said your husband died in a Burn?"" you ask. 

Your question seems to sadden Petra even more. There's unresolved pain still swimming in her eyes. Sensing her discomfort, Josella answers for you. ""You don't know about the Burn? Everyone knows about the Burn."" She pauses for a moment. ""It all started a few decades ago. All of a sudden, this horrifying beast starts attacking towns and cities...with no rhyme or purpose."" She massages her temples.

""A massive wyvern, one of the biggest ever recorded in Levera's history. Nothing could stop it...the biggest swords, the fastest arrows, the strongest catapults...it didn't matter. It didn't do shit. Thousands of people died in droves. Families burned to death in their homes. Soldiers died trying to save as many civilians as they can. Petra's husband, Robert, died in action. People have dubbed it the Burn. It happens unpredictably. Even the King himself was not safe. The Castle of Zenith was rebuilt twice in its entirety.""

Sounds like the beast you are tasked to kill.

She continues. ""The King had sent many a man to slay it. Every few years he does. Over and over. Mages. Warriors. Huntresses. Witches. Paladins. All of them...never returned from the dreaded Nine Mile Ridge. That's why I chose to stay here, in Redwood. The wyvern tends to avoid cold places such as this. I hear he sent someone else to slay the wyvern, this year. I can only hope that that person will succeed. To end this suffering.""

""I see. How long has the guardsmen been looking for your son?""

Petra wipes a tear from her eye. ""They-they've been searching for the past half hour...but they said they may have to stop...because of the weather. I don't blame them...but that's my son out there. The only family that's left.""

Josella shakes her head, unsure of what to do. ""Caleb is a smart kid...he'll make it.""

The door opens, revealing the presence of a guardsmen, covered head to toe in snow, his face a bright red.

""Sir! Did you find anything? Anything at all?"" asks Petra.

His silence is his only answer, prompting Petra to cry once again in Josella's arms.

"[PI] For generations, the kingdom is under constant threat from a powerful dragon. To end it once and for all, the king sends you on a quest to slay it. (Choose Your Own Adventure)",blahgarfogar,"Streaks of blue illuminate the dim forest. Pieces of bark are torn off while the vegetation are set on fire by the intense heat of the energy bolts. The rumbling of thunder rattles your rib cage.

Anna's voice is barely audible in the ensuing chaos. “I count three of them! Left side! Left side! Contact on left side!”

Downing an adrenaline potion, the world takes on a much more intense view with more vibrant colors and saturated hues. Your veins feel hot, searing under your skin. Time slows, but your steps quicken. 

A bolt barely misses you, ripping through a deformed tree root. Belle’s body has fallen off the log and into a puddle of mud, a smoking bloody stump where her head used to be.

One of the guardsmen panics behind a tree. ""Jesus Christ! Fuck!""

Magnus conjures a hasty Binding Wall Hex to cover the retreat. Anna slides behind a boulder, which explodes behind her, sending her flying into a small freshwater stream.

“Advancing!"" you shout, sword in hand. 

The warlocks have revealed themselves, appearing out of dense black smoke. Blackened robes surround their lean bodies, while silver masks obscure their faces. Crackling energy erupts out of their palms. You slice his limbs off, blood spurting onto the damp soil. Shurikens shriek past your ears as you continue to keep the pressure up. Your sword clangs against a staff. You maneuver around it, elbowing the warlock in the jaw, finishing the scuffle with a decapitation that leaves him headless.

Magnus joins you in defending the left flank, unleashing a beam of translucent lighting that sets him on fire. Pieces of flesh and skin erupt outwards.

Meanwhile, another guardsmen is hit by a powerful energy bolt, causing a nasty burn near his neck. Magnus walks forward, undeterred by the mysterious figures.

Magnus deflects an energy bolt with a flick of his hand, sending it screaming into a tree. “Stand down, invaders. I’m giving you one last chance.”

A burst of lighting erupts from Anna’s left arm, melting everything in its path. This forces one of the warlocks to back off to cover, but he doesn’t get far, thanks to spear throw from a guardsman.

The remaining necromancer is undeterred, summoning rotting corpses to erupt from the soil, each of them limping towards you with ill intent. Each of them are riddled with maggots and thick sludge in various states of decay.

That's...*necromancy*.

*Impossible.*

Peter is unblinkingly flanked by one of the Undead, and is bitten in the neck. “AGGGH! SOMEONE HELP-“ A waterfall of blood gushes out of his neck, pouring onto the forest floor. Anna pries the Undead minion off of him, blasting it repeatedly with stun bolts.

It’s a disturbing sight.

One of the corpses is Belle’s headless body. 

She flails her arm at you with tremendous speed. Cursing, you dodge her attack, slicing her legs off with your weapon. Blood splatters onto your plating. She continues to crawl towards you. You pin the corpse to the ground, dislocating her shoulder. With a wide swing, you slash through the rest of her limbs. 

“So be it.” whispers Magnus, mourning the loss of Belle. Calmly, he slam his cane down, causing a shimmering field to wash over the lone necromancer, freezing him and the corpses in place. You and the surviving guardsmen make short work of the other Undead, while Magnus approaches the necromancer. The mage pulls his mask away telekinetically, then tears his robe apart, revealing arcane tattoos and markings slathering his chest and arms.

The necromancer laughs uncontrollably. His maniacal cackles echo through the forest.

You can see Magnus grinding his teeth. “Who are you?” the mage simply asks. “What are you planning in Wren?”

“How many more are out there?” you growl. ""Where is Kalian?""

“Prepare…to ascend…It will be…*heavenly*…” whispers the necromancers. He’s insane. Magnus is not pleased. With a wave of his hand, the necromancer is sent flying into a tree trunk, breaking his spine. The blind mage immediately kneels, catching his breath.

You go to him. “Magnus, are you hurt?”

“Something…is not right.” replies Magnus, out of breath. “They have returned. The Third Ascension.""

""These people...they can bring the dead back to life? That's not possible.""

""You have much to learn about Nevra's darkest secrets, Elkado.""

You count the casualties.

Belle, Peter, and one of the guardsmen are pronounced dead by Anna. The sorceress takes a moment to hold back her vomit.

Only a handful of people are left to investigate Wren.

“There could be more out there.” says Anna, wrapping her wrist in a bandage. “It’s too dangerous-“

“No.” replies Magnus. “If we do not stop whatever it is they are planning, then I fear more people will die.”

A guardsmen is appalled at Magnus's statement. ""Did you not see what they can do? They literally raised the dead! They-they got Abel!""

""I will go to Wren, with or without you."" says Magnus. ""We must finish what we set out to do.""

As the mist clears, you wade through the bloody aftermath, examining the necromancers. Clearly, they have modified themselves with arcane tattoos, skin grafts and powerful amulets.

You pry deeper into the whereabouts of Petra's missing son. You ask her about Caleb's personality, what he is like.

""Caleb has always been a hard worker. He's the man of the house now. It isn't like him to just go out there without a backup plan. He's very organized. He's been back and forth from the forest, many times. God...please watch over him.""

So, Caleb was an experienced outdoorsman, even at a young age. He thinks out his actions carefully, and has done the same routine several times. For him to get himself lost seems...unlikely, or at the very least, highly suspicious.

Perhaps an animal attack slowed him down? A run in with some bandits? Though you wonder what bandits would be doing their deeds all the way here in Redwood, an isolated town far from the capital.

Something is off, but searching for him now remains a difficult task.

You ask her about any potential enemies Caleb might have had.

""Enemies? What are you implying?""

You say you just want to get all the facts.

""Here in Redwood, everyone knows each other. We're a real friendly bunch. We've been through some hard times together as a community. Caleb was always respectful. I don't see why anyone would have it out for him...""

You're somewhat dissatisfied with her answer, but you should've know her maternal bias would come into play.

Time is running out. Soon, the town will be shrouded in the darkness of night. You talk to the guardsmen who's in charge of the search.

The guardsman sighs, rubbing his hands together to generate any kind of warmth. He's sitting by the fireplace, drained of energy. Fresh batches of snow are still on his shoulders.

You ask him how long he was out there for.

""Can't say. Being out there...it really messes you up. Must've been twenty minutes. Maybe less.""

You inquire about the conditions.

""Can't see what's in front of ya. Visibility is only a couple meters. Snow's up to me knees. If that boy is out there...he'll be buried unless he finds shelter. Ain't no cave or outhouse in these neck of the woods. I hate to say it...but I don't think that boy is gonna make it. Lived here my whole life. Never, ever seen anyone get through a storm alive. Never. The frostbite will get ya. Then your fingers will fall off, your nose too, maybe. Ah, shit. Damn shame. We'll have to wait it out, and pray.""

...

What do you do?
=

- Head out into the blizzard to search for Caleb.

- Wait for the storm to pass, then begin the search.

- Head back to your room, for there is nothing you can do. Leave the search to the guardsmen.

[IP] Dangerous Sea,blakester731,"The dark clouds had swept over the sky and settled there, obscuring the sun behind a curtain of black. The wind followed, howling a song accompanied by the constant pattering of rain. The storm muttered threats of thunder, riling up the ocean and turning the rhythmic waves into violent chaos. The waves would surge upwards and crash back to the surface with no remorse.

But that didn't faze the most dangerous thing in the sea.

It prowled the ocean, silent but deadly, searching for its victim. It would travel, rain or shine, calm or choppy, windy or still. It would fight, never resting, never hesitating, until its prey was found and sunken to the bottom of the sea. In the water, there was no hiding from the danger; only on dry land were you safe.

The most dangerous thing in the sea was the might of a human vessel.",EmpressOfTheSpacebar
[IP] Dangerous Sea,blakester731,"Froth and foam blasted the *Shifter*'s hull as lightning lanced into the waves around them. Men scurried across the deck, pulling down sails to keep the ship from capsizing. A lone man stood at the helm, his hook latched firmly into the wheel. His brawny shoulders rippled as the frigid water impacted his flesh. Pushing against the wind, a thinner man stumbled to the bridge, his black cloak thrashing in the wind. ""A beast be comin'!"" he projected through the storm, arcane power dripping from the tome in his hands.

""Man the cannons!"" Captain Grave shouted, his strong voice carrying to the sailors, ""the storm has woken a creature from the depths!""

Sailors ran through the torrential downpour, anchoring themselves with rope to the mast. One knot slipped, and a hand of pirates slid through the railing and into the sea. With a noise like the snapping of a mountain, a blue-finned monster  rose from the deep and tore into the unlucky string of pirates. A few hung from the rope, and Grizzin the goblin reached into his belt, yanking out his gilded knife.
""I be takin' you down with me!"" Grizzin swore to the Kraken, raking through its shimmering scales. *Shifter*'s starboard cannons fired, making meaty explosions wherever they impacted the Beast. 

The Kraken screamed in agony, thrashing its tail in the water. Sensing opportunity, the warlock let go of his hold on captain Grave's neck and screamed an eldritch invocation at the Beast. Dark lightning flashed through the air, shredding the skin on the Kraken's gills. With a gulp, it tore Grizzin from his dagger-carved perch in its flesh and fled beneath the waves.

Eventually, the stormy seas calmed themselves, letting the pirates finally rest. ""We did a number on that one, cap'n,"" the Warlock said with some pride.

Grave stared down his comrade, chomping down on the pipe that had, miraculously, managed to stay alight during the entire confrontation, ""Next time a Kraken takes the *Shifter*, we aren't lettin' it leave alive.""",Chaochris
[IP] Dangerous Sea,blakester731,Nice twist :),blakester731
[IP] Dangerous Sea,blakester731,"Nice job, liked your captain character. One thing I might look at for your test is showing instead of telling, a cliche phrase at the best of times and one I think you can play with a little more loosely with short stories and flash fiction. But all the same, just a couple of examples (also I forget how to quote on Reddit, so bear with me);

His order was demanding. He hid his excitement and pleasure in a serious attitude etc.

I feel like this can be more subtle, possibly as follows:

""Report!"" He snapped, hiding any trace of pleasure beneath a mask of command. 

It's more concise, a little more floral, and leaves more for the reader to infer and read into it for themselves. Less precise, but I think you still get the idea across. Also:

The boy responded with a little stutter in his voice.

You've already shown us the stutter in the way you wrote his dialogue, with an extra N and a pause between One. You don't need to tell us he has a stutter again. In situations like this, it might be best to write it at least one of two ways:

""N...nothing, sir. There's, uh, noo trace of it for the last, um, thirty, thirty minutes."" 

Not the best example that, but you get the idea. Or:

""Nothing sir. There's no trace of it for the last thiry minutes."" He said, slight a stutter causing the words to come out haltingly. 

These are just some thoughts I had, take them or leave them. Good luck with your test!",blakester731
[IP] Dangerous Sea,blakester731,"The boiling morning sun shone down on ocean as far as the eye could see. Every vicious wave brought the rickety boat to life, propelling it forward and creating a slight creak. The sails, shaped like a man puffing out his chest, were making full use of the strong winds, getting the vessel a good distance away from where they had last been.

The crew had come to life, a stark difference to what it had been a few hours ago. The light of dawn illuminated the starboard side, but left the entirety of the other in shadow. The captain didn’t mind it – the temperature was far too much for him in his extravagant clothing.

Every second of every minute was filled with shouting, heaving, groaning and any other sound one could think of – men desperately trying to follow their orders in the face of danger. Their foreheads were covered with sweat and their arms straining from the exercise of pulling, pushing, and holding.

The captain breathed in the salty sea air. This was what he liked, despite the situation, the beautiful clear water, the atmosphere of sailing, and the exhilaration of the chase or being chased – it unlocked something inside of him, gave him immense pleasure.

His trance was snapped when a scrawny teenage boy approached him, his body covered in a patchwork of materials that somehow formed a pair of shorts and a short sleeved top.

“Report”

His order was demanding. He hid his excitement and pleasure in a serious attitude, to maintain leadership and intimidation.

“N..nothing, sir. There’s no trace of it for the last thirty minutes. One… one of the watchmen saw it returning into the water when we passed the cliffs. The men still think we’re in danger.”

The boy responded with a little stutter in his voice.

The captain surveyed the water. The waves had stopped and as far as the eye could see, the water was still and clear, with a slightly green tinge. The winds blew softly, much less then they had seemed to a moment before.

“That’s because we are. Tell the gunners to prepare for an assault. We’re in for a rough ride very, *very* soon.”

The boy ran away, ducking into a door and scurrying down the stairs on the other sides. A few seconds later, he could hear the sounds of metal below the deck, and the rolling sound that could only be the loading of cannons.

The smell of sulphur wafted in the air, like a rotten egg. Bubbles rose from the sea and popped. A scaly emerald tail poked up from the depths of the ocean. It was time for the fight of their lives.

[IP] The Feeder,blakester731,"**Shaheen of the Desert Sea**

It has come to this, I, the greatest warrior that has ever lived, and that monster, the most fearsome monster to ever rule the desert. They call it *Al-Ankabout Al Akbar* - the Great Spider, the spider as big as mountains that rules the barren desert surrounding the city.

Many travelers and warriors have come across it but none have lived to tell the tale. I will be the first, I must be, for I am Shaheen ibn Ayam of the Desert Sea. A god among men, or so the commoners believe, the only godly thing about me is this trusty weapon in my hand. It's blade, bathed in the venom of desert spiders, forged by the fire of the sun, and it's wood carved from the Tree of Life itself - *Sayf Al-Shams*. A spear given the name of a sword, the desert folk were not known for their clever names. Simple, hardworking people, only thing they respect is strength and honor. I must end the spider's reign and let the sun rule once again. 

I charge at the monster's legs but it is quicker than I would have imagined for it's size, but not quick enough, I roll as it shoots it's web at me. The ground it struck was a glowing green but I had no time to contemplate, it raised it's giant legs and stabbed at me. I swung Al-Shams at it but the force sent the spear skidding four hundred feet away. 

*Foolish of me, deflecting a monster's attack with a spear!* I had no weapon to defend myself and no option but to run after it. *Four hundred feet.* I can make that in seven seconds, the monster needs two seconds to lift it's legs and half a second to strike. *A god of numbers perhaps but I am no god among men* 

I had no time to plan, *Al-Ankabout* shot another venomous web and caught my foot. *Damn it, I was too slow,* I looked up at the monster's face, I did not see it's yellow eyes before. They were glowing at the sight of it's next meal. *Fool, you think the greatest warrior would go down that easily!*

It bent down and spread it's mouth wide open, *the hero never dies*, I grab onto the edge of it's mouth with my left arm and it snaps down at it. The arm is completely torn off, blood gushing onto the floor and onto my face. My robes are drenched in blood, the smell of my own blood awakens him. I can hear him calling me, the beast inside has found his foe. 

My eyes turn a livid, dark greyish blue that glows when he smells blood. This battle was not mine to fight, it was his, I can claim no victory here or anywhere had it not been for him. In an instant, he finds the sword and returns to the monster. Stabs at it's legs and swings himself to the top of *Al-Ankabout's* head. His right hand transforms into the claws of a beast and digs into the monster's eyes. 

*Al-Ankabout* tries to shake him off but his hand is well rooted into his eyes as he digs into it and shreds away. His one hand acting at the speed of four, that is the power of the *jinn*. Unmatched speed and the strength of a mountain giant, a mere spider cannot defeat the power of an untamed spirit. He leaps off it's head and grabs the spear, slashes his leg off, but the monster was still standing. It gathers up it's venom and shoots it rapidly at him. *Al-Shams*, now in the hands of he was covered with his glowing blue fire, he deflects the venom and cuts off the second leg, and cuts of the last two remaining legs in a blink of an eye. 

The monster falls to the ground, defeated, he stands infront it, spear in hand. Takes one long look at the beast, his fire glowing against the monster's eyes. With a final leap, he drills the spear into the spider's head and tears it apart. The inside of its head was a pool of green venom, but it had no effect on a *jinn* - his fire reflects earthly damage for he is not of this world.

The bullet wound in his leg kept bleeding through bandages, we were running out of things to use. Klaus the only person we knew who had any medical experience, a vet. His expertise was almost limited to horses that we reared on the land near our village. He… He didn’t make it. With little medical knowledge between us it wasn’t looking good for Adler. It wasn’t looking good for any of us. 

Moritz led the way. He was always good with directions. But when you’re only heading is east that wasn’t all too hard. The war had been hard lost. City’s destroyed. Roads demolished. Tunnels caved in, bridges crumbled. There was no easy path. We were in no good shape. Our shoes worn down and our feet bloody. The only thing driving us on was the thought of home.

Fritz was being worn down and you could see it in his face. Black surrounded his eyes from sleepless nights. Yet Fritz had both his eyes and his ears. Fritz was the main reason we were still alive. The war may be over but for such a small company, there were plenty of people who’d want us dead. Suicide missions to attempt to destroy what we could not keep. Enemy soldiers to release their pent up anger. We were a small group, easily pushed around. We could be killed and no one would bat an eyelid. Fritz was the one responsible for keeping us away from them. Just playing dead wasn’t an option. They’d shoot at our bodies and then we would be dead. We lost Heinz that way. But with no shrubbery to hide in in the fields of death the only option was to dive into craters where the shells had fallen. Sometimes sleeping alongside unexploded ordinance.

Ulbrecht was a mad man. We had always thought so. The war only confirmed it. Ulbrecht had the only functioning rifle, not that he had many bullets left if any at all. He had the only knife. He had the last grenade. He was responsible for food. Not that food was great. We just learned not to ask what it was. Bird, rat, human. We didn’t care. Food was food and when you haven’t eaten for weeks at a time a single mouthful of mystery meat is as good as anything. The last thing you needed was to gag when you found out it was your best friend, who had died some several months earlier, pickled tongue. 

And me. My some miracle I had survived. Despite how many bets there were on my death. Bets that had been made in jest. We were great soldiers of the motherland. Our race was superior to all. Our plans iron clad working in conjunction with our allies half way round the world. It was impossible for us to loose. That’s what we had been told. Now there were so many bets to pay and no one to pay them too. 

As we travelled language changed. People of our tongue cried out in anguish. Of the unspeakable things that had been done with them. But these cries were rare. More were the cheers of those in foreign tongues. The further east we travelled the less we could recognise, of the land, of the language, of the people. 

As we travelled home I tried to keep everyone sane. Tried to bring back the normality of home. Remind people of their mothers, of their girlfriends, of their wives. I swear Adler only held on to life in the hopes of seeing his wife one more time. She was pregnant when we left. The child would be a couple of years old now. But even I had been away so long I couldn’t tell you how long. We talked about what they might be like. Would it be a boy or a girl? Would they have their mothers clear blue eyes? His mother was Fritz’s world. He was always a mummy’s boy. However much he would deny it. These nights he would cry about how much he wanted to see his mother. No longer caring what the few of us left thought about it. I can’t say I understood what drove Ulbrecht. He was the eldest and even at home we didn’t really talk to him. His slightly mad ways tended to repel the rest of us. I couldn’t get much more than a grunt out of him when I asked him what he was going to do when we got home. But I continued to try. War had scared us all more than just physically. I was simply trying to glue together what I could find of the broken pieces. 

We continued east as the lands around us changed. Always hoping that home was just round the next corner. Just over the next hill. That once we were there the sun would shine and the lands would be green, that home would be exactly as we had left it. Despite knowing deep down how unlikely that would be. 

We headed through East Germany. Searching for our home we knew to be somewhere round here. Wandering in circles where we thought it should be. Hoping that we would soon find our home and that the tragedies of this Second World War would fade away when we got home. That better times lay ahead of us. That no one would ever have to live through a third. Hope was what kept us all alive.

I didn’t have the heart to tell them that we had long since passed the ruins of what we once called home. I was trying to keep the five of us alive. Not realising in doing so it had killed me inside.

"[WP] Two people love each other, they just don't realise it.",dawnsshadow_,"He finally worked up the courage to tell her he loved her in the summer. She was driving and they were on their way to the ice cream place when it all came pouring out. Understandably, she was shocked. He had never once before expressed a desire for anything past friendship. She didn't know how to react, but her first instinct was to tell him exactly what she felt. This resulted in the two of them eating ice cream in silence. He walked home. 

All he wanted to to try a relationship, and she felt like she owed it to him. They had been friends for so long. They went on one date and somehow, their friendship crashed and burned afterwards.

The atmosphere between them was tense, and they decided it was best to not talk for a while. A few months after the ice cream incident, around christmas, a mutual friend invited them both to a board game night. They didn't know who else would be there, so they both went. That was the first time she saw him in a different way. They ended their separation. Maybe the possibility of being more than friends was worth exploring. She wasn't sure, but over the months she fell in love with him too. She was working up the courage to ask him out on a proper date.

In February she invited him to lunch, hoping to ask him. She steered the conversation towards relationships. He mentioned that he had a date the next week, on Valentine's day. She realized he had moved on and decided that she would rather he be happy with someone else than be happy herself. She really did love him. If she was being honest though, she didn't expect the date to turn into anything. Maybe afterwards when it went terribly she could tell him.

The date went better than anyone could hope, and suddenly he had a girlfriend. In truth, all he could think about during the date was her. How much he loved her. How his love put a wedge between them. How he needed to prove to her that his love was gone, so that their now fragile friendship could continue. So he stayed in this arrangement. He wasn't really going on dates with his girlfriend, he was just staying home and playing video games. He made it seem like his life was together, when really he was falling apart. How long could he keep up the charade? 

She was jealous of his girlfriend, jealous of how easy it was for him to stop loving her while her feelings just grew stronger and stronger every day. They were torn.

On memorial day, he and his girlfriend were supposed to come to her house for a barbeque. He showed up by himself. She asked him what happened. He said his girlfriend was feeling sick and stayed home. She started getting suspicious. Why didn't he stay home as well and care for her? She knew him. She knew he was kind and caring. She knew he was the type of person to make chicken soup for his sick friends. Of course, she didn't say anything about it to him. He thought he had gotten away with the lie. They continued on like this until his barbeque on the fourth of July.

She walked inside his house to go to the bathroom. There was no toilet paper left so she reached into the cabinet to replace it. Strange, she thought. There weren't any pads or tampons in there. Looking around, there was no women's shampoo or conditioner. No second toothbrush. No Bobby pins stuck in the carpet. That was when she knew.

He was standing outside waiting for the fireworks to start, wondering what excuse he would use this time. He heard footsteps coming from inside the house. Light and fast. Someone in a hurry. Turning his head toward the door he saw her. She ran straight towards him, with this look on her face like she just found the cure to cancer. She stood in front of him out of breath. That was when he knew.

She kissed him just as the fireworks began above them.",thewindblower
"[WP] Two people love each other, they just don't realise it.",dawnsshadow_,"Damn it, Felix had left his lab equipment in the sink again. Carlo couldn't stand working with the guy, but his funding was all that kept Carlo's research alive. Shaking his head, Carlo wrote a strongly worded note, stuck it to the sink head and locked up the lab for the night.

""Clean up or clear out"" read Felix the next morning. It seemed that Carlo had reached the end of his rope. Nothing else filled Felix with so much joy. It helped that Carlo had ended the note with ""Sir"".

Chuckling to himself, Felix took out his pen. ""Yes Dear,"" he wrote ""I'll do the dishes if you do your laundry"". He stuck the note on top of Carlo's and ignored the pile of unwashed materials, using Carlo's set instead. He worked away, humming to himself and examine mice brains until Carlo showed up.

""Are you using my scalpel?"" Carlo sputtered. ""Damn it, Felix. You need to clean up your shit""

""Technically, all of this is my shit"" reminded the self-made billionaire, gesturing around the lab with the scalpel. He ducked his head, getting back to work as Carlo read his note.

""We already discussed the laundry issue, *dear*. We don't need to control for starch content, because the error is insignificant.""

""Well fine, *sweetheart*. Then my lab etiquette is insignificant as well""

""Damn it Felix, that is a totally different matter""

""Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn""

Carlo sighed. Sometimes he felt like he was trapped in an unhappy marriage with Felix and was too poor to file for divorce. But how could he reason with a man who thought that quoting Gone With the Wind could win him every argument? It was better to keep quiet and add fluorescent markers to enzymes.

Two hours and one failed viral vector later, Carlo was ready to break for lunch. ""You want anything to eat?"" he asked. Really, all that Felix wanted was a guy to curl up on the couch with and watch Gone With the Wind. He didn't say that. In fact, he didn't say anything.

""Hey? Hello? Honey bunches, would you like me to make you a home-cooked meal and-""

""Carlo, shut up and let me work""

""alrighty, please starve before i get back""

""Shame on whoever gave you your Biomedical PhD""

Carlo was out the door before Felix had finished his sentence. He could have bought something from the vending machine, but if one good thing had come from his partnership with Felix, it was that he got a lot of fresh air avoiding the guy.

Across the street, he lined up to buy a sandwich and eat his feelings. Waiting for his order to arrive, Carlo noticed his ex boyfriend walking into the adjacent  Chipotle and immediately flushed with year old embarrassment. It was hard to forget about the guy who left him because of his dedication to his work. He was determined to find a relationship with someone who supported his endeavors, but that wouldn't be easy. Any thoughts of feeling sorry for himself were interrupted by Felix's text: ""cofee pls""

Carlo swore under his breath. Apologizing to the cashier, he asked to add something to his order.

""My partner just can't make up his mind"" he explained to the kind lady behind the counter.

""It's fine, dearie. My husband's the same way, but I'm sure you'd agree that some people are worth it""

""oh,"" Carlo responded dumbly. He started to explain himself, but the lady was smiling so warmly that he said ""yeah. Yeah, my guy's a keeper"".
Weirded-out by his own behavior, Carlo grabbed his order and stumbled out of the cafe.

He found Felix in the lab, hunched over his work.

""Hey sugar, did you get my coffee?""

Carlo snapped.

""Great balls of fire! Don't bother me anymore, and don't call me sugar!""

Felix froze. ""Did you just quote Gone With the Wind?""

""Umm, yeah. I guess I did"" Carlo admitted. 

Felix didn't know what to do with himself.

""I got you a bagel, you don't eat enough,"" Carlo muttered, dropping the bag on the counter and turning towards the lounge. ""And don't eat in the lab, please"" he added.

""Oh"" said Felix dumbly. ""Yeah, I'll catch up with you"" he told the empty room. Weirded-out by his own behavior, Felix grabbed his bagel and stumbled out the door.",lizardcreature

He had no idea why she brought him to an isolated, empty hill, where he could never quite get comfortable as they peered into an orange sky of nothing. He had no idea why they'd been doing it for so many weeks now, in fact. 

""This is so dumb."" Jake said, believing the fact wholly, but delivering the statement in a sarcastic tone.

Jess half-chuckled, turning her head to face him. ""You're dumb, dude."" Waiting a few moments, she turned her head back towards the sun. ""I like it.""

""Dunno why. Maybe if it, like, blew up, or something."" The comment made her smile once more, but it soon faded once she realized that her subtle advance was completely misinterpreted. Minutes -long, quiet minutes- went by between the two. Occasionally, Jake would toss a glance her way. Maybe he didn't like what they were doing, but over time, it didn't really matter anymore. 

""Y'know, Jess, I-"" Placed directly in the middle of them both, a phone rings. There's no rush. One ring. Two rings. Without looking, their hands reached out at the same time, touching for seconds, seconds that must have felt like forever. They had the same ringtone.

They began to speak on a casual basis; tentative conversations in the library, where they explored each other's consciousness. They shared similar interests, she was strong willed and deeply spiritual, as was he. She wanted to change the world, improve it, help people. That was all he cared about, really, he defined one's worth as the effect one had on the people around them. She was simply infectious, he basked in the warmth of her radiant smile , that smile that quickened his heartbeat, her quick mind that made it a joy to antagonise her for the sole reason of hearing her witty responses. His eyes roamed, eternally searching for her visage, a glimpse of her brown hair, her small frame, so tender and fragile in comparison to his. She was fine China, and he thanked what ever Gods that be for giving him such a valuable friend.

""Samuel , he's so interesting"" At first she considered  cutting their interactions short, he seemed overly proficient at talking about himself. But he actually listened, and his voice wasn't unpleasant either; a bass that resonated in her chest and those resounding  waves tingled her core. He probably wasn't interested in her anyway, so she gladly enjoyed his comforting presence. ""He seems so mature, I wonder what type of girls he likes? Wow, he has a dazzling smile.He reminds me of Dad, so calm yet commanding. Does he value our friendship as much as I do?""

""Ari?"" ""Yes, Sam?"" ""I've never come across someone like you before, and I would like it if we could be friends, I don't want to let you go, you mean so much to already, in this short span of time we've known each other.""

Alisa shares this with Dan who sits down on the other end of the seesaw and begins pushing it down. Mr. Perterson is on recess duty this week. The sun glare from his watch catches her eyes as he slowly circles their playground, stopping here and there to chat to her classmates, keeping an eye on everyone.

""I saw Mrs. Evan giving him a really nice cupcake once, with lots of cream and little stars and a berry thing on top."" Dan comments. Trust Dan to remember everything food-related. 

""Yes!"" Alisa says, excited. She knows about the cupcake. She saw Mr. Davidson leaving with it and asked where he had gotten it from because it was so pretty. ""He said his friend made it and I could have a look but maybe not touch it."" She wonders if he kept it. ""Do you know that they bought matching key rings when we went to the aquarium?"" 

""You and Shannon have matching rings."" Dan rubs his nose with the back of his hand, looking past her to their classroom window. Inside, Mrs. Evans is sticking pictures up on the wall.

""No, ours are sister rings."" Alisa slaps her hand lightly on the seesaw board to get his attention.

[EU] In Hyrule Castle Town a bored soldier stands on duty in the drawbridge guard house. As the world crumbles around him and falls to the sinister rule of ganondorf he finds himself drawn more and more to the dark art of poe collecting.,ihavenowilly,"*Knock Knock Knock*

Gorman stiffened awake, suddenly alert and bewildered. His vision still smeared with sleep, he shifted slightly and realized he made the mistake of falling asleep in his armor again. A pinprick of purple light caught his attention and his eyes rested on a small bottle on his shelf. Inside the bottle, a purple flame danced. There was a face of a morphing grimace cut into the flame, alive and watching him. The bottle rattled as the living flame struggled against the cork and, in a moment, Gorman's memories of the night before flooded back. He remembered the nerve-wracking hours spent chasing a huge Poe. It manifested on the drawbridge one day, cackling and twisting its lantern. It was his first attempt trying to attack something so large - he remembered the slickness of his grip on his spear in his sweating palms. He remembered the cackling that had driven him to venture from the guard house, the soulless eyes dancing before him, waiting for him once he dared to step outside. The Poe knew he was there - it had to have known. The fight left him wounded and exhausted, and his left eye ruptured and useless. It didn't stop him from stuffing the wriggling flame of the defeated Poe into his only bottle. The rush of adrenaline once he corked it - the moment he had been dreaming of since his boyhood, now sealed and real in his hands. He was, officially, a Poe Hunter. It took all of his self control to keep himself from screaming with triumph and joy, but his fear of the ReDead within the city walls stopped the cry in his throat.

*Knock Knock Knock*

""Do the ReDead know how to knock on doors?"" Gorman thought to himself. Unlikely, but the thought of it made his stomach flip.  

*Knock Knock Knock*

""What if it's a villager?"" he thought. A sudden upwelling of guilt replaced the fear in his stomach. Gorman hid during the siege upon Hyrule Castle Town - he hid as the villagers he had sworn to protect screamed and fled past his sealed door. He hid as he heard voices die and morph into the terrible, curling moans of the ReDead. He hid as the booming laugh of the Guerdo man that brought so much grief to his people resonated through the streets, tearing down remaining Hylian soldiers brave enough to face him. Maybe it was that Dark Lord outside now, looking to complete his work to snuff out the last loyal to the Royal Family of Hyrule. Gorman snatched his spear and twisted it in his hands. He wondered...if it was Ganondorf, would the Dark Lord spare him if Gorman groveled and promised fealty to him? 

The guilt in his stomach compounded. That was a new level of cowardice, even for him.

*Knock Knock Knock*

It had to be Ganondorf outside his door. There was simply no other explanation. Gorman stared down that the spear in his hands. He failed the Royal Family, the citizens of Hyrule Castle Town, his fellow soldiers. Perhaps the Goddesses had granted him one last chance to redeem himself, one chance to plunge his spear into the hated heart of the Dark Lord and to end the suffering of his nation once and for all.

""He certainly wouldn't be expecting that from someone as lowly as me,"" thought Gorman to himself.

*Knock Knock Knock*

Gorman steeled himself and shot out of his bed. 

""I'll rush the door"", he muttered to himself. It was the only way to muster the resolve to go through with his plan.

*Knock Knock Knock Knock Knock Knock Knock Knock Knock Knock Knock Knock*

Gorman ambled forward, his spear raised above him. He nearly collided with the door and, struggling awkwardly with the lock, tore it open, his spear coiled back -

""HIIIYYAAAAAAA!""

Gorman choked and the spear fell from his grip. He blinked and stared numbly at the psychotically grinning man before him. The man kept smiling, wringing his hands and staring expectantly at Gorman through squinted eyes. He wriggled under the weight of a massive pack on his back, the painted masks tethered to it clattering against each other.

It was the goddamn Happy Mask Salesman.

""Sorry to wake you up!"" said the Happy Mask Salesman, nodding vigorously. ""I know you had quite the day yesterday! I thought I'd let you get a little shut-eye before I stopped by.""

""You're still here?!"" said Gorman. For months - or was it years? - Gorman was convinced he was the last living thing left in the town. Was this man here the whole time?

""Oh, well, not for long!"" The Happy Mask Salesman gestured wildly to the drawbridge. ""Business is pretty slow these days! Can't really get the ReDead to take much interest in my wares. Tried giving out freebies - that was pretty funny! Ever see a ReDead with a Bunny Hood on it? Hah! Hilarious! A little tricky to deal with though ... speeding one of those guys up wasn't best idea. You know how attached they can get, eh? Eh?!""

""You're still here,"" said Gorman. He couldn't explain why but the idea that someone else had been in town with him, no more than several meters away, left him emptied inside. 

""I'm off to new business ventures - new countries! Not enough happiness here to keep the business going."" The Happy Mask Salesman nodded and spread his arms wide. Gorman blinked and suddenly the Happy Mask Salesman was in a different pose, looking at him thoughtfully with a hand resting under his chin. Gorman blinked again - the Happy Mask Salesman now searching through his enormous backpack. 

""I have something for you, to help you on your own venture into business! Ah, you don't need to tell me - you're an industrious fellow, times are hard and I think you've stumbled into a business model for our, erm, colorful times!"" said the Happy Mask Salesman as his arms vanished into the darkness of his backpack. His hand suddenly shot back up, grasping a strange, peaked object.

It was a mask, dark as night save for a burning red glow at it's very center. Gorman stared at it in wonder. What magic made that red circle glow? He felt drawn into it. His hand moved of it's own accord, reaching for the mask - but Gorman caught himself and shuddered. 

""Take it,"" said the Happy Mask Salesman, his peppy voice now low and inviting. Gorman locked eyes with the Happy Mask Salesman.

""What is it?"" Gorman asked.

""The Greater Poe Hunter's Mask,"" said the Happy Mask Salesman, his smile stretching wider. ""I've kept this one hidden away - bit too scary for most folks you know, but, you! I think you will find this ... very useful. Bear in mind, it tends to, erm, mold to the face a bit, if you wear it too often. But I don't think you'll need to worry about that. Might even help with that eye of yours. It will open up your vision to a new world!""

The red circle - no, the red eye, it was definitely an eye - loomed huge in Gorman's vision. He couldn't look away.

""How much,"" said Gorman.

""For you? Free!"" said the Happy Mask Salesman, tossing it in the air to Gorman. Gorman fumbled, just catching the mask before it hit the ground. A surge of ... something shot from the mask into his body. It almost felt like bravery, but darker, deeper. 

""Go ahead, give it a try!"" said the Happy Mask Salesman, nearly dancing with excitement. Gorman didn't need to be told twice. With something like hunger he slipped the mask onto his face. There were no strings, no backing of any kind but the edges immediately sealed, enveloping his head and nearly knocking his helmet off. 

Gorman's vision swam in darkness until, suddenly, the world bent back into view. It took him a moment to realize what he was seeing at first - there was the Happy Mask Salesman, clapping like an idiot, but now an eerie glow crawled around him. The masks dangling from his pack seemed more alive somehow, and Gorman could swear that one, crafted like a Guerdo woman's face, gave him a seductive wink. Gorman looked around him, overwhelmed. 

""A perfect match! Oh, how I live for moments like these!"" said the Happy Mask Salesman, pirouetting and prancing. Suddenly, his backpack was strapped to him again and he stood, hands clasped before Gorman, his smile wide and full of secrets.

Gorman was smiling too, beneath his mask. He couldn't stop himself from smiling. 

""Thank you!"" said Gorman. His voice sounded strange, warped and higher, but somehow, perfect.

""Oh, my pleasure. I live to see my masks find their proper owners,"" said the Happy Mask Salesman. Instantly, we has meters away down the drawbridge. Gorman didn't blink - he didn't need to anymore. The Happy Mask Salesman waved to him, and Gorman waved broadly back.

""Bye byeeeeee!"" shouted the Happy Mask Salesman, as he turned and - vanished.

Gorman's focus lingered on the point where the Happy Mask Salesman once stood. His gaze lifted to the sky. Night was falling, and as the darkness crept in he felt his vision grow in strength. He plucked up the spear next to him and twirled it with a confidence and mischief he hadn't felt since boyhood, when he played Poe Hunter in the graveyards of Kakariko Village. He felt a chuckle brew inside him, lifting out of his throat in his new voice as it was carried away by the dark night wind.

""Heh he heh...""

"[WP] A child is haunted by some sort of demon/ghost that no one else can hear or see. The child is initially terrified and afraid to confront the monster, but soon makes peace with it, and finds that it is able to help her.",lavender-oil,"Julia drew her covers tighter around her and squeezed her eyes shut. She needed to get some sleep. Tomorrow was the field trip to the dairy farm and she had looked forward to it all week, but the sound of her mother and step-father arguing was keeping her awake. Her blue night light glowed by her bed, illuminating her bedroom softly. 

“She's just a child, Jeff!”

“She's a menace!” Jeff screamed back. “Her grades are bad, she doesn't have friends…she's a freak, Leslie. I’m only saying that a little discipline can go a long way.”

Julia froze. Not because of the argument. She'd heard that a hundred times. As she had lay there listening, someone had just whispered her name. She was sure of it. 

“Juuulia,” the voice said again. It was high and empty sounding, like someone speaking in a bathroom or a vacant theater. 

Julia covered her face with her hands and breathed in short pants. *This isn't real. This isn't real,* she chanted in her mind. 

The voice didn't make anymore noise and after a while of chanting to herself, Julia was able to fall asleep. 


The next day, Julia was playing dolls in her room after school when it happened again. 

“Juuuulia,” the cold, distant voice said. This time, to her horror, Julia saw a black vapor appear. A horrible stench filled the room as the mist stretched and expanded. 

“How was your field trip, little child?” The voice asked. Julia's voice was caught in her throat and she felt her pants get very warm. She thought that she must have wet them, but didn't take her eyes from the dark mist. She couldn't seem to find a face or eyes, or even a mouth. Just vapor. 

Suddenly, it vanished as her bedroom door swung open.

“Julia, I've told you a hundred times, the hand towels are meant for guests…what on earth?” Jeff looked down at the dark, embarrassing spot on her pants. 

“I…I saw…” Julia began to explain, but Jeff cut her off. 

“Julia Anderson! What is wrong with you? Are you too stupid to use the bathroom now?” 

Julia sobbed as her step-father snatched her by the wrist and dragged her to the bathroom. He ran her a bath and threw her in the tub, clothes and all, and left her there. She cried as she pulled the wet clothes off. Later, she would get the belt. She knew that. She was a bad, stupid child and she would never do anything right. Her face stung from the tears and she thought, *Maybe the vapor is here to take me. Maybe I'm so terrible and so dumb that it's going to take me away from here and torture me forever.*


Julia didn't see the vapor for a week. She was beginning to think that she'd made the whole thing up. It was a bad week anyway. Her grades were worse and that meant more beatings. She almost wished the vapor would come back and take her. 

Finally, while she was practicing her letters one evening, the vapor reappeared. It stretched and grew around her, it's strange, earthy stench filling the room. 

“Juuuulia,” it called. This time, Julia answered. 

“I know you're here to take me. I don't know where you'll take me, probably down to hell. Just get it over with. I'm a stupid child and I deserve it!” Tears streamed down her cheeks and her hands shook. She cried in choking sobs and the vapor seemed to wait for her to finish. After a few minutes, the vapor said, “Child, I am not here to take you to hell. Although, I confess, that is my home. I have come instead to free you from a black and dead soul living beneath this roof. Your energy is potent and I could not resist it. I was drawn to you because of it. You are not stupid, child. You are the wisest and strongest soul in this home. I will go now, and I will take the damaged soul with me. Goodbye, Juuuulia.” 

The vapor vanished. Julia fell to her knees and gulped hot breaths of air. Downstairs, her mother screamed as Jeff dropped dead.

""Goodnight sweetie,"" she said softly.

""Yea, goodnight mom,"" said Anna as she forced a yawn and closed her eyes.  Lisa knew she was faking but she didn't have anything to do tomorrow.  It was Saturday and her and her husband wouldn't mind being able to sleep in a bit.  Besides, she had stayed up in her room with a flashlight and read into the wee hours her fair share as a child, and it hadn't done her any harm.  Then again, maybe that's what was giving Anna those dreadful nightmares...

""Anna, sweetie,"" she said placing her hand on her daughter's arm.  Her eyes flew open just a little too quickly and half-closed in a childlike semblance of tiredness.  ""You're not still having those bad dreams are you?  I still think that those books you're reading are a little too adult for you-""

""Maaa,"" Anna said, dragging the word out and sounding exasperated.  Lisa always had to hold back a smirk when Anna tried using her adult voice.  She knew she should start breaking that habit or it would be a nightmare when her daughter became a teenager, but for now it was just too cute.

""I took care of all that,"" Anna continued.  ""I told you.  The monster and I are friends now.""

""I know.  I know.  Frederick-""

""No.  Freeederick, like in that movie, The Sound of Music.  It's 'cause he's a really good singer.  You should meet him!  He's really nice and he's only scary just at first when you see him.""  In her excitement, Anna sat up, her eyes wide.  Any imitation of sleepiness had been forgotten.

""I will someday pumpkin,"" Lisa said, kissing Anna on the cheek and standing.  ""But for now, mommy's tired.  I have to get to sleep.""  She knew Anna was too old for imaginary friends and it was strange for her to have just gotten one now, but she didn't know how to handle it.  Maybe she'd talk to the school counselor, Mr Daniels.  Or better yet, maybe Anna would grow out of it on her own.

Her mother hadn't been out of the room for ten seconds before Anna threw back the covers and ran to the window.  She peaked outside and then slid it open, letting in a late Autumn chill.  Almost too fast to be seen, a black streak flew by her and she slid the window closed again.  

She turned and her demon was behind her.  Of course, Anna was sure all the children had a demon and the adults had just forgotten about it in their old age.  They were always so forgetful like that.  

""Sheesh, took you long enough,"" he said.

""Oh, don't be such a grouch.  My mom was just tucking me in,"" Anna replied smiling at him and flopping down on her bed.  ""Did you get the answer key for the test on Monday?""

""Sure did boss,"" he answered, tossing a notebook onto her bed with a shadowy appendage.  ""The guy deserves me stealing 'em for scheduling a test on a Monday.  Jeez.""

Anna flashed him a thumbs up.  ""You're the best Frederick!""

""Belial,"" he said impatiently.  ""I've told you it's Belial.""

She scrunched up her face disapprovingly.  ""I don't like that one.  It sounds so mean!""

""Well, I am a demon.""

""Yea, but you're my demon,"" she said sweetly.  ""And you're nice!""  A yawn interrupted her speech.  ""Frederick, could you sing again to help me sleep.""

""Sure,"" he replied flitting over to the chair near her bed as she settled under the covers.

""Sleep my child and peace attend thee, all through the night,"" he began.  Maybe, not the most befitting song for a demon, but he changed up some of the lyrics to make it more appropriate.  She was asleep by the second verse.

He really shouldn't be indulging her like this.  Hadn't been what Lucifer had sent him up for, her being the Antichrist and all.  But she was just so sweet, and far more kind to him than his people had ever been.  He knew he really should be finding time to corrupt her though.

He stared down at her.  Tiny snores escaped her lips as she settled into sleep and he smiled.  There would always be time tomorrow.",poop314

[wp] An angel calls upon their guardian human for help.,moreorlesser,"Michael stood as he walked into the room.  ""Prince.  It is good to have you back.""

""No, it isn't.""  Derek responded harshly.  ""What's going on?""  He pushed the seat meant for him at the foot of the table aside and stood in front of Heaven's Generals, leaning forward with his hands on the table.  His blue eyes swept over the Angels at the table.  

The Archangel re-took his seat, inwardly reading himself for the coming conversation.  He hated it when Heaven's Human developed to the point of abrasiveness.  He had led Heaven's forces long enough to have gone through several Humans and they all eventually took on a disdainful and harsh attitude towards all matters spiritual.  He couldn't blame them, though.  Their attitude was understandable given the nature of their work.

""Hell's forces have been surging, as I'm sure you've noticed.  The unique issue this time is the fact that they have been using a new process in their surges, which we've come to call 'compounding'.""

""What does that mean?""  Derek tapped the toe of one of his boots against the floor as he continued to lean on the table.

""The method of traditional demon creation has been augmented.  The spiritual energy needed to create a Demon is now being combined with enough energy to create several Demons and it is being forced into a smaller space.  The effect of this process is that the demons are stronger and wilder.  Apparently, confinement to the small space is rather torturous and this effects the psyche of the Demon, making them more sporadic and unpredictable.  Our traditional methods of fighting them will not be effective enough to stop them.""

""And my methods?""  The Human asked.

""On that we are unclear.""  Raphael spoke up.  ""It is unknown how established practices and symbols will effect them.  However, it is a rather safe bet that extreme methods will still be capable of killing them.""

The combat boot stopped tapping against the floor.  ""How extreme are we talking here? Holy Water?  Sacred mirrors?  Those are tricky, but they usually solve what an incantation can't.""

A nervous silence followed.  ""Well..."" Raphael hesitated.  ""We can start with those, but I feel that we will likely have to progress to... sacrifice.

Derek's face somehow became even more serious.  ""Animal?""  He asked quietly.

Raphael hesitated.  ""...Human.""

Derek pushed himself up from the table and covered his face with his hands, his fingertips rubbing his eyes.  ""Jesus.""  he breathed.

All the Angels shifted uncomfortably.  ""Prince, we don't like the use of a Name of Power for no reason.""

He reached into his pocket, pulling out the flask.  ""Then you sure as Hell ain't going to like this.""  He threw his head back and raised the bottle to his lips.

Michael grimaced.  ""Foolish Cherub missed it again.""  He murmured.  ""Prince, stop.  Consuming alcohol like that is sinful.  There are other ways to deal with your problems.""

Derek could feel himself snap.  His restraint was gone.  He slammed his now half-full flask on the table, slopping a few drops of amber liquid onto the flawless surface.  ""You are my problem!  Do you know what human sacrifice entails?""  His green eyes glowered at the Commander of Heaven's Forces.  ""It's no good unless they are willing!  I can't just grab a murderer and kill him.  I need to find someone who truly cares about my shitty world enough to give up their lives!  What is that called in your Scriptures?!  Oh, yeah, the greatest love!  You want me to find someone who loves the world and their life, convince them that Demons are real, and then ask them to die for a war that they know nothing about!""

Michael began to raise his voice.  ""Prince, we are aware...""

""No!  You're not!""  Derek cut him off.  ""Do you know what happens to me when I do this?  I have to befriend them.  I have to bring them far enough into my life that they know me, they know what I do, and they care!""  The flask began to shake in his hand.  ""They care for me!  I care for them!  And then I kill them!  They lay down and look up at me as I raise a knife over their hearts!""  He squeezed his eyes shut as visions of the past crashed into his mind.  He could name them as their resigned faces flashed in front of him.  Henry, the grocer, Lilly, the loving mother, Jeremy, the high school graduate, and Emily, the only one who had smiled at him gently when he raised the blade.  He could feel his heart spasm as Emily's serene face mouthed her last words.  ""I love you.""

He choked back a sob as he opened his eyes again, looking down at his shaking hand on the table.  Tears glistened over his purple irises.  

""It is either this or the rest of Humanity.""  Michael stated, his voice soft after Derek's outburst.

""What about my humanity?""  Derek grated out, his voice ragged from shouting.  ""You call me Heaven's Human like it's some kind of honorary title, but I'm not even human to you.  You think I'm your slave, an item to be used and then forgotten until I'm necessary again.""  He raised his eyes to look at the beings of Heaven's High Command.  ""And I'm not human.  No one can do what I've done and still claim to be a human being.  I would not lessen the human race by believing that I am one of them.  But you made me this way.  I'm a murderer, a drunk, and a traitor.  I turn my back on my friends the moment I've killed them.  I drown their memories with enough alcohol to make me sleep for days!  You're right, drinking is a sin, but I would rather be a sinner on top of everything else than have to remember what I've done in the name of Heaven's Wars; in the name of your wars.  Not mine, yours.""  He pointed at Michael.

Michael steepled his fingers in front of him and closed his eyes.  ""Prince, I know that we are asking more of you than should ever be asked, but we must ask it all the same.  I regret that we are unable to handle our own war, but since Angels are unable to harm humans, we must ask that you do it in our stead.  These Demons are stronger than any foot soldiers we've ever faced before.  If you can reduce their numbers, we can destroy where they are being made and that will be end of this debacle.""

Derek's orange eyes were glazed over, staring at nothing in particular.  ""Whatever.""  He responded, taking another quick swig from his flask.  They didn't care that their explosive was destroyed while it did its work.  That's what explosives do.  ""I'll try the mirrors and water and if that doesn't work, I'll move into sacrifices.  Just keep me updated on where the sacrifices would be most effective.""

There was a nearly audible sigh of relief that swept through the room with Derek's agreement.  ""Very good.""  Michael nodded.  ""We will provide you with whatever you need in terms of relics, manuscripts, and materials.""

""Will I get that increase in my monthly allowance?""  He asked, referring to the lump sum deposited into his bank account from a local church.

Michael shook his head.  ""Prince, we are providing you with enough money to live a comfortable life.  If you feel that you do not have enough to get by, then I would recommend cutting back on the whiskey.""

Derek turned away from the table.  ""Whatever.""  He started towards the door.

""Thank you, Prince.""  Gabriel said hastily.  ""We appreciate your efforts.""

The Human looked over his shoulder at the General.  He hadn't even recognized that Gabriel was a new face at the table.  His golden eyes regarded the Angel for a moment before nodding once in acknowledgement.  He left the chamber and made his way back to the room in which he had woken up.  He laid down on the mattress and tried to fall asleep, knowing that he would wake up in his dank apartment.  Anywhere was better than here.  He dug out his flask and drank from it, gulping down the last of its contents.  It wasn't enough.  He shook the container, wishing for a few more drops to fall out, but none did.  In frustration, he threw the flask into the corner of the room with an angry shout.  He kept his eyes squeezed shut as his panting breath turned to sobs.  He remembered.  He remembered everything.  He remembered too much.  Even in Heaven's glow, Derek Prince cried himself to sleep.

I'd like to thank Keanu Reeves' character in *Constantine* for giving me a great starting point for Derek.  Hopefully, they weren't too much the same.

[wp] An angel calls upon their guardian human for help.,moreorlesser,"Heaven's High Command sat around the table in their war room.  All of them stared blankly at the polished surface of the table before them.  Finally, one of them broke the silence.

""Waiting will not change our options.  We are faced with a greater threat than we have ever faced and we must act.  We know what we have to do.  Our dislike for this course of action should not keep us from using it.""

Michael, at the head of the table, shook his head.  ""It is not dislike that makes us hesitate, Gabriel.  It is the possible consequences.  Though calling on the Human may secure the safety of the Balance for another century, it is quite possible that the actions he takes causes a fallout that will take a heavier toll than if we had not asked for anything at all.""

Gabriel took a deep breath, nodding in understanding.  ""I know you are right.  But, High Command has utilized him before, he was conditioned for a reason, and both his conditioning and past results show his reliability.""

""It's about setting a precedent."" Raphael chimed in.  ""It is rare that we need to utilize a Human to accomplish our ends, but when we do it is only as a last resort.  We must know that he is our last recourse.  If we later find that another option was available, not only will the entire action suffer severe repercussions, but it will only make it easier for other High Commands to call on a Human.""

""Alright."" Gabriel acknowledged.  ""Then it comes down to one question.  Do we have any other options?  We've been in this room for days contemplating and considering all possibilities.  How much more time will we take?""

All eyes looked to Michael.  He bowed his head and rubbed the bridge of his nose with his fingers.  ""One more day.""  he finally murmured.

""Very well.""  Gabriel leaned back in his chair to continue thinking.

*****

Derek Prince woke up in a familiar room.  It wasn't his, though.  It was too clean, well-lit, and devoid of typical bad-part-of-town noises.  He rolled over, trying to go back to sleep.  He was in Heaven again.  And it was always trouble when he was in Heaven.  They never brought him around just so that he could have a good meal or experience some quiet.  He sighed frustratedly into the almost too soft pillow under his head.  For all of their holiness, the Angels had never been very charitable to him.  He knew for a fact they didn't like him around.  He reminded them too much of the dark times they had struggled through.  He wasn't a comrade; he was a weapon.  More of an explosive than anything else.  Whatever sentiment a soldier might have with a firearm, they gave no thought to valuing an explosive.  It was a dangerous item to be used and forgotten.  When there was no conflict, explosives were not kept around for security, and they were definitely not an object of reminiscing.  Their effect and their results, yes, but not the explosive itself.  To the Angels, he was nothing more than a brick of C4.

He wouldn't get any more sleep.  An attendant must have known he was awake and entered the room.  Or he had just entered the room with the intention of waking him.  The Angels didn't understand the necessity of sleep.  Even if they did, Derek doubted they would have taken it into consideration in his case.

""Prince.""  The attendant started.  ""Do you know where you are?""

Derek sat up and looked at the low-ranking cherubim.  His movements felt foggy, no doubt due to the excessive amounts of alcohol he had consumed the night before.  Apparently, there was still enough alcohol in his system to keep him slightly drunk.  That was fine.  He rather liked it that way.  It was better than the alternative.

""Yes, I'm in Heaven.  I'm guessing that Michael is facing another immanent threat?""  He swung his legs over the side of the bed and stretched his neck, cracking it a few times.  

The cherubim grimaced at the sound of the Human's joints popping.  ""Ah, yes, it would seem so.  You are needed in the War Room of High Command.""

Derek took a deep breath and stood.  ""Well, then let's get going.""  he began to walk past the Angel to leave the room.

The cherubim blinked in surprise as he caught a whiff of Derek's body odor.  ""Ah, Prince, would you like to take a shower before meeting with the Generals?""

The human stopped in his tracks and looked directly into the servant's eyes.  ""Do *you* want me to?""

The cherubim's eyes suddenly focused on the floor.  He shifted nervously.  ""Ah, well, I think it would be well-advised.  Um, one should always keep one's self clean.  Next to Godliness, you know.  Rather fitting considering where we are.  Ah, what is the phrase?  When in Italy...?""

Derek didn't even bother correcting him.  He walked toward the room's attached bathroom, stripping as he went.  He unbuttoned his stained, grey dress shirt that he wore untucked and dropped it on the floor as he kicked off his unlaced black combat boots.  His black denim jeans were next.  But before they hit the floor, he deftly plucked something from the front pocket.  He walked into the bathroom and started the water of the shower, not even bothering to close the door behind him.  The Cherubim was picking up his clothes from the floor.  Derek caught him wrinkling his nose as he did so.  While the Angel was occupied with the clothes, Derek quickly stashed his concealed item behind the toilet.

""Shall I bring you a fresh robe?""  He asked as Prince stepped under the water.

""No, just launder those and bring them back.""

""Very well.""  The servant exited the room.

Derek let himself soak under the piping hot water.  His skin that was not covered in tattoos reddened with the heat.  The ink on his body were mainly charms and symbols meant to guarantee protection against spiritual forces.  The Angels had given them to him when he became their Human.  They worked most of the time.  Every now and again, a demonic assassin had to be fended off, but most had learned to stay away by now.  He massaged shampoo into his thinning hair.  Even though he was only 27, the stress of his job was showing.  His hairline had receded a bit, making his formerly slight widow's peak far more pronounced.  Even though his hair was still dark, a few gray hairs were scattered about his head.  His stresses did not negatively affect his body, however.  He was quite muscular and athletic, as he maintained a fitness regimen that had saved his life more than a few times.  Being strong and disciplined enough helped immensely when faced with possessed beings.  

He rinsed off and toweled off.  He pulled the hair on the top of his scalp back into a rubber band.  The hair on the back and side of his head was trimmed very closely.  He had chosen the style because he could maintain it himself.  Just cut the tail when it got too long and use clippers on everything else.  He didn't like barbers.  Even hands busy with scissors could become the Devil's playground when those blades could be used to kill Heaven's Human. 

He could see his clothes lying folded on his bed.  Getting his clothes cleaned in Heaven was one of the few perks of coming to the place.  Not only could they be cleaned extremely fast, they were more restored than cleaned.  It was like they were brand new.  The stains in his shirt that had been there for months and several washes were now gone.  The thinning fabric over the knees of his jeans was no longer thin.  He got dressed and started to leave the room before stopping and returning to the bathroom.  He retrieved his flask from behind the toilet.  Slipping it back into his pocket, he made for the door again.  

The cherubim was waiting for him outside.  He began leading the way to the War Room.  ""It was Rome, wasn't it?""  He said after a while.  ""When in Rome?""

Derek didn't respond.

""It just seems strange that so popular a phrase wouldn't be updated with changing geography, right?""

Silence again filled the hall.  The servant settled into it uncomfortably.

Derek didn't enjoy being rude to the Angels.  He felt that it was necessary and deserved.  They hated him.  From his smell to his human needs to the fact that he was a necessity.  They used him, dismissed him, then summoned him again when he was needed.  He acted the way he did just because he wanted them to know that he hated them too.

They finally reached the War Room.  ""They are waiting for you inside.""  The Angel turned on his heel and left, clearly wanting to be rid of the abrasive human.

Derek waited until the servant turned a corner before pulling out his flask and taking a mouthful of his whiskey.  The smooth and slightly bitter taste of Buffalo Trace washed over his tongue.  It was immeasurably better than the Jack Daniels he was usually forced to drink due to the fact that demon killing didn't pay well.  This was his emergency flask, however.  He always slept with it in his pocket in case he woke up in Heaven.  And if he was in Heaven, he definitely needed some of the good stuff.  Well, the good stuff that he could afford, again.  He would prefer Lagavulin, but he wasn't made of money.  He slipped the matte black container back into his pocket and swung open the door in front of him.

"[WP] It turns out that cats understand everything we say, but their throat structure only lets them meow. Today, we found a way to understand their speech...",si1ver1yning,"""There you are, Kiki! Come here, want a treat? Fooood?"" Thompson enunciated as he reached for his tabby under the bed. She tried to dig her claws into the carpet, but he was too strong for her, determined to test his oh so academically approved garage lab research. As he lifted her, she resigned to his grasp. She loved her fingerbeast, and knew he wouldn't drop her, but she did not sign up to be his tinker tester, and he kept getting his work wrong. While she loved to watch his ductile digits manipulate wires and send smoke and sparks into the air like magic, when he shoved her into the strange heavy collars, and spoke to her the way they talk to their babbling babies, her patience ran dry. And after the one time that the collar shocked her... Well her trust for his toys hadn't been the same. 

""This one is different, Kiki, I promise. I video chatted with a veterinarian and a German canine psychologist last night, who had worked on an fMRI project, mapping dogs' neurolinguistic centers, and I got an idea. With their data and my algorithms, you and I will be discoursing with the president in no time!"" she blinked at him, which he took to mean that she felt safe, but it was the equivalent of eye rolling. He caressed her face and scratched her chin and neck, before putting his hand on her back to force her to lie down. She harrumphed in protest; the force wasn't necessary - he could have asked. But as he lowered the hard metal box into her head, she dilated her pupils and reared back. This one wasn't just a collar, but a whole helmet! He had taken selfies with her in stupid hats before but this was scary, and making a whining noise that she didn't like. 

""It's okay, Kiki...""
""Mrreeaaoooww. Mroooohhh.""
""You're okay, Kiki, just let me.... There.""
""Mmmmnnnooo you stupid fingerbeast! These NEVER worrrroooowwwww!""
""Oh my god.""

The device sounded like his old cleaning monster chewing a piece of string, whirring and whining in and out with Kiki's meow. Kiki could hear her meow echo in the helmet, and the voice that sounded like a fingerbeast saying what she thought, but as he tinkered, it went away. Afraid of what was happening, she backed away, trying to get the helmet off. But as she did she hit a button that started a loud buzz on her ears. The fingerbeast voice became low and demanding, ""get it OFFF I don't like it,"" her other paw hit a spinning knob and it got louder, ""it's scaring me, Thompson!""
""Okay, okay, I'll take it off, Kiki, I don't want you to be scared, just hold still...""
""Did... Did you just...""
""Understand you?"" He said, unfastening the collar at the back of the helmet. ""Yeah, that's what this thing does. But you wanted it off, so... There you go.""
""Prrrow?"" 
""Well I can't understand you now. Only with the helmet on.""
Kiki looked at the helmet and back at Thompson. She was afraid, but curious. But it had been an ordeal already. She hopped off the lab table and trotted to her food bowl, where se howled for her reward. She figured she had endured enough for one day. 
""Kikiiii. You could use your words!""
""RaaaOOOOOOWWWW!"" She demanded. 
""Alright alright. You did well."" He gave he her food and returned to tinker with the helmet, hoping she would return after a little break. ""You know, I didn't realize you called me 'Thompson.' Figured you had some other pet name for me... Fingerbeast though... Heh, that's a good one. Makes sense.""

Kiki was shocked by what had happened. She did not want to try again. She heard her thoughts in the language she never thought she would be able to speak... In truth she wasn't speaking it, she supposed. She could hear her meows inside the helmet but that voice... It was too much. She retired to her pillow under Thompson's bed, dozing off to the sounds of him mumbling to himself. 

""Maybe if I reflect the intonation.... I hope it's not too heavy for her... Maybe if I use aluminum... Heh... And she was saying these never work.""

It wasn't until the birds outside started chattering about the dewdrops that he finally dragged his feet to bed. She heard the floorboards creak under his slippers, and opened one eye to watch the bed slats bow with his weight as he sat, sighing, and removed his socks to massage his feet. She loved the smell of his feet. They smelled like him and everywhere he had been. His story. Her home. She sighed a big sigh of his stink and stretched one paw out toward the edge of the bed, reaching toward his discarded socks, but left her leg lazily outstretched, and exhaled back into a dream.

""We'll try again tomorrow, my sweet fuzz. I can't wait to hear about your dreams. I'm sure it's more than just food and the laser pointer.""

He began to wheeze his familiar wheeze only a few moments later, the rhythm of his breathing lulling Kiki into a deeper sleep, until she was jarred awake by its absence. He did this every now and then- just stopped breathing for hundreds of heartbeats. It always sent her into a panic. If he didn't start breathing again, how would he wake up? She scrambled out from under the bed and hopped up onto his bed, walking into his chest. 
""Prrow?"" C'mon, Thompson, where's that cough? ""MmmrrrNNNNnnmN! MmnnnYYYEEAAAH"" Too many heartbeats had passed. This silence was lasting longer than the others. Kiki batted his face with her paw. Nothing. She let Her claws out just a little and stomped on his cheek, his neck, his ear-

He gasped loud and low, sending her flying across the room in a fright. Her tail poofed and she wanted to sprint out of the room, but she wanted to make sure he kept breathing. Sometimes he did the gasp thing and then went right back into a silence. She listened from the door, as his wheeze began again. 

She let out a sigh of relief, and began to smooth her tail fur. Her heart was pounding in her ears. She wouldn't be able to sleep again tonight. Outside the windows she saw the sky getting brighter, as the birds sang louder, calling to each other to rejoice the morning, the smug, feathered assholes. Kiki wandered to her food bowl, nibbled a bit, drank some water, and started wandering around the old little house, sniffing the settled dust. She hopped into a window, and watched cars pass with sleepy fingerbeasts staring ahead. She wandered to the kitchen and sniffed at the dishes in the sink. Thompson had had tuna with eggs and oil as salt and wheat, that still clung to the bowl and spoon. She helped him clean it. 

From the kitchen counter Kiki could see the workbench through the open door, the helmet sitting there in the dull morning light. She remembered the strange metallic smell and the scary whirr of the helmet, the weird echo and foreign voice speaking her thoughts. It hadn't really been that bad, just strange... Her curiosity piqued. 

She hopped down and carefully plodded toward the open door, sniffing the air for anything out of place, as Thompson wheezed on behind her. She hopped up on the lab table, and sniffed at the tools scattered about, pushing a few to see what sounds they would make against the metal of the table. One made a nice clank. She wondered if it would make the same noise on the concrete below... Nope. 

She sniffed the helmet, and now the metallic scent was familiar. Still scary but not as much as before. And there was something she hadn't smelled before... A plastic? Some kind of the sticky stuff? Glue? She carefully dipped her head into the hole, and breathed deeply. The whirring was still there, but not as loud. As she wondered about the construction, the helmet began to buzz again. She jumped back in surprise, and the buzz stopped. 

She stood frozen for a moment, then began to sniff again... Was something in there? The buzz cackled quietly as she thought. ""Ohhh,"" the helmet whispered in unison. Kiki retreated, understanding but still surprised. This one actually seemed to work. Thompson would be so.... Then she realized she couldn't hear his wheeze anymore. ""No!"" The helmet whispered. Kiki realized it was louder the closer she got to the helmet. She wanted to run to him, but didn't know how many heartbeats he had stopped breathing. 

She stuck her head into the helmet as screamed, ""THOMPSON!"" 
Silence. "" THOMPSON, YOU HAVE TO WAKE UP!!"" She still couldn't hear him. ""NNNOOOOOAAAWWWW!!!"" She ripped her head out, scattering tools about the table as she jumped back to sprint to her fingerbeast, hoping it wasn't too late, but as she shoved the lab door open, she saw him standing in the kitchen, mouth hanging open in astonishment, hair sticking up where the pillow had licked it. She stopped short on the carpet, breathing hard, looking up at his wide eyes.

Before me, writhing in pain, was a lord of chaos. This particular one went by the name of T̵͡ḩ̀͘o҉̷̵͢m̶̧̕҉a̵̷͠s̶̶͏̕͝. 

I had been summoned about ten minutes ago by a lord of pain, named

"[WP]You, an average human, are summoned by demons to wreck havoc on their enemies",silverchaser,"One moment I was resting on a train, trying to drown out the screeching wail as it raced on the tracks; the next, I was sitting on a stone floor, breathing in sulfurous vapors and surrounded my demons.

Small demons. Like, palm-sized, with barbed tails, leathery wings and horned heads. They were also dancing and cheering in tinny voices, raising toothpick-length pitchforks into the air.

""Praise the man,"" they cried. ""Praise the man.""

""What the devils?"" I said, shooting to my feet.

At once, they fell silent, staring up at me with luminous eyes. One of them said, ""Beg pardon, but we're not devils.""

""I don't care what you are,"" I said, looking around. It was pitch-black; even the sky was hidden behind a veil of gloom. No plants, no buildings were in sight. Other than my voice, it was quiet, except for an almost inaudible buzzing coming from somewhere ahead. ""This is a bad trip. Gotta be those cookies Jean brought back from Amsterdam.""

""Cookies ..."" the demons crooned.

""Shut up. I'm going to wake up now. Goodbye."" I shut my eyes, counted to five, and opened them again. There were even more of the things now, some hovering in the air, wings flapping furiously.

“Okay, what’s the deal? What’s going on?” I said, feeling more annoyed than frightened. I mean, look at these guys.

“We summoned you here,” a demon said, pointing at one of his fellows. “Jxxga recommended you.”

Jxxga waved shyly. I frowned. “Recommended me? I don’t even know this guy.”

“Oh, but you do,” Jxxga said earnestly. “We may not have met in person, but you’ve listened to my voice. Loads of times.”

I rolled my eyes. “I’m not mental. Look, you brought me here, you can send me back. I want to go, right now.”

The demons began muttering, and Jxxga said, “Actually, we need your help. We’re under attack. We’re all that’s left of our people.”

“Nutella-coated nuts,” I said.

“I’m serious. They’re coming as we speak. Do you hear that?”

I shrugged, but he was right. The buzzing was getting louder, and a faint light was growing out of the darkness. Whatever it was, the outline was big. “What the hell’s that?”

“Our greatest enemies,” Jxxga whispered. The rest of the demons were nodding fearfully. “Please, great man, save us.”

“Save us,” the rest chanted.

“Fine! But you send me back right after.” They began whooping, following me as I walked forward to meet the threat.

“Whoever’s out there, you leave these guys alone,” I said, sounding braver than I felt. I thought of asking for a pitchfork, but dismissed the ridiculous notion. “You hear me? Leave them—what the hell?”

The light materialized before me as a swarm of beautiful, white-clad women, just as tiny as the demons and wielding spears. Their wings hummed as they beat the air, sending a warm draft our way. When they saw me, they gasped.

“It’s the great man,” one of them said. “Carl, don’t you remember me? Helixia? I know we haven’t talked lately, but …”

“Get them!” another of the angels shouted. Raising her staff, she swooped at the cowering demons, who shrieked and scattered. Or at least she did until I swatted her out of the air. The other angels began attacking as well, and I began to feel like a tower being surrounded by dogfighting planes. At least none of them had hit me yet.

“I don’t have time for this,” I said, turning to the demons. “You really expect me to beat them for you?”

“Do we look like we wanted this?” Jxxga shouted, dodging blasts of light from one of the angels. “Would you rather stand around arguing, or finish them off and go home to your six pack and porn?”

“Good point,” I said, and began smacking and kicking the angels. Before long, dozens of them lay dazed on the ground, and the rest were zooming away, crying pearly tears and calling me names like “naughty badman” and “son of a b—bad”.

“There,” I said, tossing a pair of angels into the pile that the demons had gathered. They were eyeing the angels with distaste, but did nothing otherwise.

“Thank you, great man,” Jxxga said. The rest echoed his words.

“Just send me back,” I said. “Straight home, not back on that shit train. You owe me that much.”

Jxxga smiled as they gathered into a circle around me. “Can I join you later tonight?”

“Well, since Helixia won’t be …” Grinning, I nodded.

"[WP] Noah's Ark is found. As your team navigates the ship's remains, you hear a ""thump""...",tayaravaknin,"Unbelievably, there it was. A boat. In a cave at an altitude of 1584m on mount Ararat. 

THE boat. The Ark. Noah's ark.

Of course, finding it had been the whole point of the expedition all along. Not officially, the university would never fund such a crazy mission. Officially we were looking for remains of a neolithic culture that had lived in the mountains because they had been driven away from the lowlands by a more warlike people, possibly the Hattians. You could get funding for that sort of thing. Something that would, even if we succeeded, interest no one outside the archeological community. But inofficially we all knew what we were looking for.

This was not the first of Professor Forcas Ark expeditions. It was almost a tradition at the university. Every summer he arranged a three-week expedition to the Ararat mountains. bringing with him a couple of factulty members and a handful of PhD students. Out of which at least some were experienced climbers.

He needed the climbers of course. This wasn't the Himalayas. There were no local Sherpas to rely on. He needed people to carry the gear for him. People who could talk sense into him when the route was planned. If left to plan the route himself, he would have killed half the faculty in various accidents.

I was there as one of the climbers. I've been a climbing since I was a kid. I can't explain what it is about a mountain that makes you want to go up it, maybe it's that sense of freedom. When you're up there, it's like nothing in the whole world can trouble you. I was also there because my thesis was going nowhere, and I needed to get away from that for a while. 

The other PhD students were also climbers. The older faculty members were regulars. Again, this was a bit of a tradition. Or maybe they secretly shared Professor Forcas crazy dream. That sounds like Professor Forcas was a nutcase. He wasn't. He was one of the most popular professors. He was clever, funny and charismatic. His lectures were fascinating. And he was the only one of the university staff who was a bit of a celebrity.

As for me, I dind't believe much in the Noah story at the time. Not literally. But I did use a lot of biblical references in my work. My thesis was about cultural interaction in the mediterranean during the neolithic and bronze ages, so I had to use all the historical references I could find. And the bible is full of them. But it was just another source. Just like pottery, tools, burial customs etc.. And in more recent times, studies of the human genome.  

Still, there were some rather intriguing stuff in there. Like the Nephilim. 

They're only mentioned twice in the bible. They are called ""the sons of God"", but also ""the fallen ones"". And it says ""The Nephilim were on the earth in those days—and also afterward—when the sons of God went to the daughters of humans and had children by them.""

Which some say means the Nephilim were not humans at all, but fallen angels. Who had given in to the temptation of human women and bred in with them, passionately. Given the topic of my thesis, I couldn't help being intrigued. 

And of course, being a girl, I had to wonder about the women's side of the story. Like, was it consensual? Did the women have a say in it? 
Maybe they did...  Maybe they were the ones who wanted it? What would the Nephilim look like? And what would it be like to mate with a fallen angel? 

All that had little to do with science, of course. But I couldn't get it out of my head. In fact, that was one of the reasons why my research was at a standstill. I couldn't quite find the inspiration.. stuff like the Nephilim distracted me too much.

And I was dealing with the ethical dilemma of the Ark. Like, isn't it very intolerant to destroy your creation if you're God? Do you really have the right to do that? We had a few interesting campfire discussions about that among the crew. That and all the what-ifs.

Like, why would you bother to save pests like poisonous snakes and rats and roaches? Wouldn't an flood be an opportunity to get rid of such creatures? What would be Noah's view on that? Did he just do as he was told? Or did he try to interfere in favor of species he thought were better for the world.. or vice versa? Would that be right? 

Or did God do that? To spell it out: Was there a species that was so terrible that God had wiped them out completely? If so, what could that have been? And was it justified? 
Of course, as someone pointed out, it was self-righteous of us humans to even HAVE this discussion, given how many species we have wiped out ourselves.

But still, it was intriguing. And what about the other peoples? How ethical was it to just save one people and kill the rest? Wasn't that racism?

Of course we know that dind't happen, because we can trace our history in the human genome.. The genetic variation is too great for that to have occurred. Maybe there was a flood, but it didn't wipe everyone else out. 

But theoretically, it could have wiped out SOME ethnical group. And then, according to the story, that was because they did not get along with God. That's a pretty rotten deal. What terrible sin could have caused such animosity? 
   
Another interesting thing was an odd little habit of Professor Forcas. He had this compass thing. It had like a sundial on top of it with a sharp point. You could hurt yourself with it. And Professor Forcas did. He'd prick his finger every now and then on it, and let the blood drop down on to the dial. And then he'd study the compass intently. I asked him what he was doing, and he said something about the voice of the blood. I never could make sense of that.

---

There were so many unanswered questions. And now there was the Ark itself... We were, all just staring at it, unable to speak.. 

Eureka. The cover of Time magazine. TV... talk shows.. Hysteria.. 

And meticulous science. Every single gram of that thing would have to be radiocarbon dated and genetically analysed and what have you. It had to be be extensively documented. The examination would take years and..

Thump.

I looked around. I wasn't the only one who heard it. It wasn't just my imagination.

Thump.

It was coming from inside the boat... SOMETHING WAS ALIVE IN THERE. That was impossible..that was..a sealed container. Nothing could have managed to be alive in there for so long. Unless it had gotten in somehow, but there seemed to be no way to do that.

Everyone was paralysed except Professor Forcas.

""Ladies and Gentlemen"", he said firmly. ""I'm not going to say 'I told you so.' But I will ask you to give me a hand. In the name of science.""

And then he picked up a rock and started walking towards the Ark. I found myself walking after him. The others did too. 

The boat turned out to have a large hatch in the side. With some kind of lock on. Professor Forcas started pounding on the lock, which soon broke into hundreds of pieces. That lock would ever be properly examined, which didn't exactly benefit science. But on the other hand, whatever as in there wasn't going to wait for meticulous science. Professor Forcas told us to help him open the hatch and we all did. 

When the door swung open there was a huge compartment inside of it, lined with metal. In it there were fifteen large shapes that appeared to be.. statues. Representing some sort of angels maybe.. Winged figures. Carved out of something dark like obsidian.. and so beautiful.. Whatever creatures they were supposed to depict, it was clear that these were perfect specimens. 

But why waste all that storage space on something that wasn't alive and therefore didn't need saving? Why?

Because they weren't statues.

The ""statues"" were slowly coming to life. That's what the thumping came from. It was as if they were waking up from some frozen state. Their movements were awkward, almost spastic at first.. And since they were so big and heavy they thumped against the floor. But gradually their motions became smoother and more natural. After a few minutes their skin looked more natural and less like some kind of rock. Maybe that obsidian-skin thing was part of the hibernation process that these creatures were clearly capable of. 

Who'd lock these creatures who were so human-looking up? Who? Noah and his family? And why?

I guess the only sane emotional reaction at that point would be to be terrified, but I wasn't. I was caught in a strange mixture of wariness and fascination. And Professor Forcas didn't seem afraid at all. And I figured he knew what he was doing. Or did he? 

My thoughts were interrupted when the creatures turned around and looked at us. And started walking out of their prison. I don't know what would have been the right thing to do then. To try to stop them or to try to communicate with them maybe. But none of us did anything. We just let them pass. Until they stood there in front of us. 

They were huge but not giants, about seven or eight feet tall. They had bodies that could only be described as perfect. Their wings were black and covered in fine feathers. Not like angel wings but not like.. devil or demon wings either. 

They were calm in a way that might have been unsettling. But they didn't seem hostile. One of them was clearly their leader. I was wondering if any of us (Professor Forcas probably) would manage to communicate with them. 

I didn't have to think about that for long. Because their leader spoke first.

""Forcas"", he said. ""You're late. Very late.""

What?.. These creatures had been in hibernation for millennia.. There was no way they could be expected to speak english, and yet they did. I was still trying to get over that when Professor Forcas answered.

""Azariel"", he said, smiling, ""I know. Long time no see. But you know the conditions weren't right. You know the prophecy. We have to follow it.""",PalePrincessSnowWite

His sword, which he still somehow clutched in his armoured hand was very nearly worthless as a blade. His shield was gone, and his helmet was dented and cracked. 

Four nights ago the Lord of Rogtenshrine had asked for knights to slay a beast inside the aging, decrepit castle on the border of Rogtenshrine and Thistlebrook. The duchess, Sir Francis's ruler, had sent two dozen of her best Knights to destroy the beast, as she was worried it would attack her own realm. 

Now, out of those two dozen only one remained, Sir Francis. 

As he entered the Castle's dining hall he saw a noticeable change in his surroundings. Whereas the rest of the castle was dark and eerie the dining hall was bright and welcoming. There, in the seat reserved for the Castle's ruler sat a small, red Dwarf. He was eating a boar, freshly cooked and Sir Francis had to clang his boots together to get the small creature's attention.

""You there. Dwarf! I have come to avenge my comrades!"" The Dwarf laughed heartily. 

""Did you now? Well I'm sorry to say I am not the one who wish to kill."" It replied in a cheery, happy voice that sent chills up Sir Francis's spine. 

""Almost two dozen Knights of the Realm are dead, Dwarf! And you are the only thing in this disgusting old ruin that could have killed them!"" Sir Francis walked up to the Dwarf, sword raised.

""Oh?"" The Dwarf asked. ""I would have remembered killing such heavily armoured foes. And the last time I killed such mortal men was many eons ago. You are looking for my Brother.""

""If you are not the killer, then what is?"" 

""As I said. My brother. Oh he always was a scheming bastard. I never loved him, hated his guts, actually.""

Sir Francis was overjoyed, for he was a man who could tell when one was being truthful, and he was often employed by the Duchess to detect liars. This Dwarf wasn't lying. 

""So then, perhaps brave Dwarf, you can help me with my task?"" 

""I can indeed call my brother here! Why didn't you simply ask sooner?"" The Dwarf replied grinning. Sir Francis was about to state he had never asked for the Dwaf to call his brother but suddenly the chwndles and torches flickered rapidly and a large gust of wind blew in from the door. 

Sir Francis prepared himself to face the entity that had killed so many of his comrades. When it finally appeared, Sir Francis was at a loss for words.

It was a black void, hovering above the ground. There was no discernible shape to it, no arms, legs, head. Nothing to denote gender either. He faced the beast down with glaring eyes.

""Brother! How are you doing this fine evening?"" The Dwaf asked from behind Sir Francis. 

The entity made no move to show it head the Dwarf except speak. From where Sir Francis didn't know. The voice was calm yet evil, it made Sir Francis want to hide somewhere far, far away from here.

*Ah....the last Beacon. Thank you Brother! Your fellows were easy prey for me, Beacon. How will you fare, I wonder?*

""There are two of us against you, monster! You shall die by my blade!"" 

*Yet, there were two dozen Beacons only an hour ago, yet now there is one. Are you afraid, Knight of Thistlebrook? Are you fearful?*

""We will kill you!"" 

*We? There is no we. There is you, and only you. Your ally has betrayed you, taken you for a fool.*

""Wha-"" Before Sir Francis could finish his sentence he felt a dagger penetrating his plate armour and being driven into his spine. He heard the Dwarf cackling with glee.

""No ill will intended mate, but as you know, I'm the God of Chaos, and what better Chaos than a betrayal!"" As the entity enveloped Sir Francis he screamed at the top of his lungs. 

All his cries would fall on deaf ears. And with that, the final Beacon of Light fell. In the end, as it was before, no one can kill a god.",AdmiralGinger

The attention that will ensue once my story is heard will make me a celebrity, I'm ecstatic, I really am, but the sight of my fist connecting to these poor children's diseased bodies sickens me. At first I could rationalize what I was doing, but now I'm just confused. I feel guilty for attacking them even though I know that I'm helping. I feel guilty for my desire to give up this lifestyle even though I can change their ailing bodies for the better. This power is too much to bear. I feel like I'm depriving the feeble by not hitting them, but as each of them scream in terror it leaves me feeling like a monster. I should just continue in my ways. I stumbled upon this special ability by accident. This real snarky kid in middle school would always terrorize me; he was taking out his problems on me. I was unaware at the time that this little monster was suffering from brain cancer. I didn't even know what that was but I noticed that he was becoming progressively weaker as the school year progressed. I'd like for you to keep in mind that I'm not a bad person. Anyways, I saw that kid in the hospital on the day that I had gone to visit my sister who was having her appendix taken out. The little kid was just sitting in his chair looking drained of life. His eyes drooped and his complexion was very pale. I was just going to walk by his room but he yelled something, an insult I assumed. I gradually pushed his door all the way open. He stares at me. I become fueled with rage. I hit him with all of my might, and again, and again. He's screaming. I keep punching and kicking until I'm fatigued. Then to much of my surprise he's reinvigorated with new life. He then proceeds to pummel me. This was where I learned of my special abilities.",08ncaa

Someone wants me to tell the story of the Tickler. Alright let me smoke this cigarette real quick. Alright. See there was this one super hero that came through town. Was dressed in white from head to toe cept for his fingertips they was the only part of him you could see. He was a black guy. Kept his fingernails real short. Just the first knuckle was visible and the rest of him was covered in what looked like latex or pleather or maybe leather it was textured it's hard to tell probably had to cut it off. Anyways he slept in Fountain Square in Cincinnati and every day he would walk around and people would come to him and he would give scalp massages and people would receive orgasms and feel pleasure because he had as it turns out radioactivity coming out of his body because he a fermian descendant of the fourth order which means he was a little denser than uranium and one guy popped off on him during a scalp massage and and the Tickler I swear to God he just inserted his pinky ring right through that guy's eyeball and he loved the way it felt like heaven to him because of that finger thing he could do.

He could hear the cries of his separated platoon, though the dust and smoke made finding them impossible. He tried desperately to orient himself, to somehow either make it back to his trench or rendezvous with his comrades. Wit no other option, Jacob dropped to his belly and began crawling away from the exploding lights that decorated the smoggy sky. Within minutes he could make out a thin line of low-cut barbed wire. Praying he was in friendly territory, Jacob shifted to his knees, tilting his head ever so slightly to peer over.

Jacob woke up screaming in agony. He was sprawled on his back, a gaping hole centered through his abdomen. The pain was beyond excruciating. As he writhed and squirmed and gritted his teeth, Jacob's cries were joined by a dozen other men sprawled around him, all suffering from similar, if not worse wounds. Jacob began to sob, silently begging for a quick end.

In the distance, a faint, familiar whirring began. The searing pain in Jacob's stomach was briefly dulled, giving priority to a sick, crunching anxiety that spread through his chest. As the whirring grew loud and the faint outlines of the white MedBots appeared, Jacob ground his forehead into the dirt, trying to suffocate his senses. It did not work.

Though he kept his eyes shut, Jacob felt the inorganic creatures working at him, probing him, mending him. Their eel-like antenna injected him with morphine and nanobots, and their spider shaped claws sutured his wound closed. Within minutes the pain had subsided, and he could hear the whirring fade away. Jacob lay still, hoping that this was perhaps a long, arduous dream.

""Seventh Company, fall in!"" boomed Colonel Wilkins. This was the 3rd resurrection Jacob had lived through, and the colonel began each one with the same command. He stood shakily, his legs feeling like lead weights. ""Central estimates that close to 85% of us made it through this one, which leaves us with over 1,500 men, more than enough to storm those blasted buggers' trench!""

Jacob dry-heaved, steeling himself for the next familiar order. ""Once more into the breach, you mangy dogs!""",MavisMudslide

[WP] A superhero whose punches heal rather than harm. Their origin story is kicking the shit out of a kid with terminal cancer.,BertrandsMate,"Her? Oh well she was divine! An adorable little mousey faced girl of about 28. She had the ""fortune"" of being one of those short, buxom and lithe creatures for which all the boys yearn. 

Yet misfortune struck on the day of her birth. Her charisma came up lacking when she rolled the proverbial 20-sided die. That is to say she has no social skills... like, at all! It's astounding! 

I have lived for *over 300 years* by punching myself in the face whenever I groan getting up from the couch and in my short stay here I've yet to meet a less obtuse human being. 

Her idiosyncrasies blend with her quirks blend with her habits which blend with her personality and emerge resembling something like Slimer from **Ghostbusters 5D: Smell You Now, Sucker!** 

You know they're actually allowing androids to act in movies now? Incredible... 

When I found her the poor thing was so starved for attention she was having conversations with **lab mice!** Lab mice?! They're basically rats that know math! Horrifying little beady eyed devils are probably still plotting to kill us all even after their 3rd attempt. 

*Anyways* that's not to say she's a mean or foul person, mind you, as she was such a horribly pleasant person that given the chance anyone might have fallen head over heels for her if they had ever ended up getting close to her. 

Not that anyone ever really did until her first husband, and again after that on the day I followed her home! 

Dunw- 

What's that? About the other thing? Yes, yes we'll get to the hitting. 

Her first husband was an Ivy League *prat*. Pretty, pretentious, and pompous through and through. But, he cheated on her **so** no description **Dunprick.** Enjoy your shifts cleaning shit up at the local hospital you talentless motivational hack! 

No this story is about **her** and it was about damn time she got some attention anyways. The world owes that to her thanks to her advancements in sustainable pharmacology. 

She was a scientist working at some-such-or-other labs and finished her schooling at an equally prestigious campus I'm sure. That was so long ago I'm having trouble placing them.. 

So one rainy night after seeing the tumultuous breakup which left a 26 year old girl with no parents, no social skills, and no support system due to her cheating ex-husband alone in cold I decided to keep tabs on her. 

She broke down in tears on that wet night and the streaks of cloud-given moisture that crossed her face were drowned by the immense pain she felt that day. 

That was one of the only times I have seen that girl cry. When you first meet her it's almost a little creepy how much eye contact she makes while she smiles at you. 

Very unnerving, I told you no social skills at all. 

After seeing the breakup I kept tabs on her to make sure she made it through. The girl was literally all smiles so it took me about two years to figure out how much she was hurting on the inside. 

I was eating ramen on another stormy night at my favorite place on the other side of town, fortuitously in the vicinity of one mouse faced scientist. 

I was consuming my delicious MSG near the window watching the rain and she walked into my field of view. 

And you know how sometimes you just know something? I knew. 

This girl was going to kill herself tonight. 

I can't tell you if it was a lack of glow in her eyes, a faint stutter in her smile, or just the empathy I've gained after living so long. But this girl was on her way home to end her own life. 

So I stalked her. 

I stalked her through the rain and and the dim to the foot of her apartment building. I waited for her to finish a cigarette which I'm sure was a new habit as of that night and then I followed her into the squat, soulless bread box that passed for affordable housing in that day. 

Inside the hallway I watched the numbers tick down as her elevator descended to the sublevels of housing. She stopped at U21, the 21st level of underground domiciles. You needed to pay a premium to love above ground. 

At the top of the winding spiral carbon fiber stairs I took off my rain soaked socks and and boots and I left them to the side. I stared down into the open aired wine cellar-like confinement of doors and watched to confirm where she resided. 

The elevator made an obnoxiously loud dinging sound and I wanted to be sure she didn't get startled and do something rash. 

Down, down the winding DNA shaped lattice of steps, passing only one fellow using the second helix of *up* stairs. He paid me no mind and did not, could not expect what I was about to do. 

I stepped off the stairs and walked as silently as possible to the foot of her door. 

Two knocks, short, but not fast. One to prick the ears, and the other to provide a sense of anticipation. 

I knew she would answer the door. Why wouldn't she? In the ""best"" case it was her ex come to apologize and take her back, and in the worst case it was a murderer which, as it stood, kinda made ending her life a bit easier. 

I stood and waited, finger over the peephole, bare feet exposed, no baited breath. 

And calm as a creek when she opened the door I pushed it wide open, ripped her shirt off, and I drop kicked that girl right in the fucking chest. I kicked her so hard the air in her lungs escaping through her mouth and nose was audible. 

A faint red imprint of my foot still pops up between her tits when she gets angry! 

I stood over her with clenched fists. This girl was so screwed up I was worried I might need to hit her harder to fix her. 

After she finished clutching her chest and gasping for air she caught her breath and stood up. 

She promptly informed me of her dire need for Cheetos and began to walk out her front door. I told her she should probably wear a shirt and it was happily ever after that I guess? 

I mean we're still married after, what? Seventy years? 

And she doesn't look a day over 30 since we regularly get in fist fights. At least she knows how to tell a guy to fuck off! We went back to the ramen place after getting her cheesy snacks where I explained what happened and who I was. 

She had no idea there was a super hero who went around kicking the shit out of sick kids to heal them. 

After that we kind of just clicked. I told you, infectiously pleasant. 

I saved her life and I was the first person she'd met after I hit her and knocked all her self loathing and and doubt out of the **MOTHER FUCKING PARK!** How the hell could she NOT fall in love with me!? 

*cough* 

Sorry, I get pumped at how great I am nowadays. 

All was right with the world. I was worried there for a little while. The world was on a downwards spin for so long and no one could find anyone to be with because everyone relied on their hilariously basic phones. 

I was most certain I was doomed to live a life of lonesomeness on a dying rock but I the universe must've had a different plan for me. 

Things certainly changed for the better after I clocked President Trump in the mouth though didn't they? ",WyrdPleigh

Their origin story is kicking the shit out of a kid with terminal cancer.,BertrandsMate,"I stood, poised on the top of Hothgam tower in dramatic repose, listening intently to every noise I could hear in the city. All of a sudden I jumped down and glided gracefully down to the bank. A criminal was holding them up. He saw me and pointed his gun at me and pulled the trigger, but he was wrong about where I was; I was behind him. He shot a hay filled dummy that exploded dramatically. Shocked, he turned around and was kissed on the forehead by my speeding fist. I am the holy bluebird paladin of Hothgam and this is my story.

When I was in first grade I knew a kid named Ethan who was pale and wore a cap over his bald head. He had terminal cancer. Everyone was really nice to him, but he was an asshole. One day on the playground I was alone on the jungle gym, spacing out at the clouds, when he walked up with his pussy posse. He insulted my sweater, my mom, and then moved to slap me. I had enough; I dodged his swiftly flying hand and shoved him. But that wasn't enough for me. He insulted my *sweater.* I kicked him in the nuts. I walked around. I looked at his mates. They stepped back and cowered. I could see the teacher blowing the whistle in the distance and walking towards us. I kicked his teeth. I kicked his head. Finally I kicked his side with a brute, hard force, right in the left lung where he had cancer. It was cruel of me. But something strange happened that only I witnessed; a blue spark connected between my big toe and his body. He burped and it let out a small curl of *blue smoke.* I walked away. I heard an ambulance in the distance. Then I jumped the fence and walked home.  
  
---  
  
My blue uniform glistened in the dim lighting of the Hothgam Community bank. The criminal lay there, crippled on the floor. Someone started a slow clap. When the clap was at its loudest the criminal woke up with a start and stood up gingerly. He looked me in the eyes and apologized. He kicked his gun that lay on the ground to my feet. Police sirens could be heard. The crowd quieted down as the police entered the bank. The criminal shook my hand, smiled, and introduced himself. Then he gave himself up to the police. As he was being handcuffed he proclaimed to me that he would change, he would improve, and open up his own bank when he got out.  
  
---  
  
The next day Ethan apologized to me the first thing in the morning. The teacher didn't talk to me about it. I was very surprised. Later on in the class period the teacher invited Ethan up and announced that he had started a fight yesterday and was sorry about it, but his lung cancer had miraculously dissipated. I looked at my fist and noticed a what was clearly a blue hair on my knuckle. I leaned back in my chair and gave up my suspicions and spaced out at the window again.

[WP] A superhero whose punches heal rather than harm. Their origin story is kicking the shit out of a kid with terminal cancer.,BertrandsMate,"The night my life changed wasn’t all that unusual. It was summer, and in Florida, that means heat, a wet, clinging heat that fills your lungs and clouds your mind. People up North say that everybody in Florida’s a little crazy, and I can’t say I blame them. But if you lived here, and put up with this heat eight months a year, you would be, too. 

I was just getting out of my local gym after a quick workout and a couple light sparring matches. Coach said that I had some great hands, and might even make it as a pro, if I could just learn to stop dropping my shoulder before my left hook. He was right, but I figured, if my boxing was good enough to earn me a scholarship to a big school out of state, I couldn’t be too bad, right?

It was my last summer before I headed off to college. First in my family to get accepted, and on a full ride, no less. Granted, it was a mixed scholarship, with some of my tuition paid for by my athletics, and the rest split between a work-study program and academic-based grants, but money is money. I didn’t know what I wanted to study, or what I wanted to do after I graduated, but that was something I had time to think about. I was a little distracted, and that’s probably why he was able to sneak up on me like he did. 

He wasn’t what I would call a “big guy,” but as a light heavyweight, I’m bigger than most. He had a sleeveless hoodie on, and the hood was up, which was unusual for the time of year. I couldn’t see his face, but I could smell him just fine. Old weed, beer, and something chemical I couldn’t place, but that reminded me of a hospital for some reason. The front of his hoodie was covered in puke, and he didn’t seem too steady on his feet. He shuffled at me, grumbling, “Give me your wallet, asshole.” I backed up, and that’s when I saw the knife in his hand. 

He saw my eyes widen at the sight of the blade, and he growled again, “Wallet, man. I ain’t got time to wait for your bullshit. Now.” I took it out of my gym bag and threw it at his feet, shaking. He bent over to pick it up, and as he stood back up, the hood slid off. 

His head was completely bald, and his eyebrows were gone, but I still recognized the teen from the press conference a few months back. The local children's hospital had initially admitted him for leukemia, but had found stolen pain meds in his bed while changing the sheets. Between that and accusations of pervy behavior by some of the younger girls in his wing, the hospital had had no choice but to kick him out. The local news had picked up his story and ran with it, and the hospital had been forced to readmit him in the face of a public outcry. Apparently he was still undergoing treatment, and was still an asshole. 

As he straightened up, he realized his hood was off, and he sighed. “Well, shit. You’ve seen me, and I’m guessing you know who I am.” I nodded slightly. “Guess I don’t have any choice now.” He lunged, knife outstretched. Instinct took over, and I ducked inside his outstretched arm. I was able to land two quick blows to his ribs before I backed out and squared up. My next jab broke his nose. The cross I followed it with sent him spinning, dropping the knife in shock. He hit the ground and I followed, fists moving like pistons.

I don't know how long I spent hitting him. I just know when I stopped. 

A few months later, I went off to school, and it was the damnedest thing. Anybody I sparred with came out looking like a million bucks, and I looked like discount hamburger meat. Can’t win many fights like that, so my scholarship for boxing got pulled, but I was able to convince the athletic director to hire me on part-time as a sparring partner for the school’s team, which helped make up the difference. On the plus side of things, I think I’ve figured out what I want to do with my life. “Oncologist” has a nice ring to it.",FuckingSeaWarrior

I fucked bitches because I felt like it, had no real sense of attachment to anyone or anything. for me being a bastard was the way of thing. I broke bones for a living, you could call me a doctor, a butcher, a debt collector, hell call me a jew if it makes you feel any fucking better. but i was a real prick, the scum of the earth. people in the movie industry try to paint fuckwads like me believably, but they just don't get it. guys like me aren't born evil, we're made. we're forged by an uncaring society and we learn a hard fact of life, compassion is a joke, kindness is for the weak. life is a competition, and the rules are inherently fucked. so we gentlemen you call ""criminals"" or ""thugs"" we're the answer to a system designed to force peace on people. we're the guys who know how well playing the game of life by its rules actually works, so we give it the middle finger and fuck over all the other players. it don't get us much, but it gets us enough. might controls everything, and without power you can't protect anything, and that'd be a nice little ideal if anything in the world was fucking worth protecting. so now that we've got my personality outta the way, let's talk where this train wreck of a mindset, a god-complex nihilism line of thinking (or some shit, I don't know what those fancy assed words mean) got me.
I saw this kid, I was feeling pretty nasty and i see this fucking bald kid, he's holding a balloon, his pa is laughing with him as he looks up into the sky like he's on drugs or some shit.
I can't fucking stand that innocent look, that fucking sick, out of place naive gaze that makes me want to puke. to think kids exist like this, delusional from birth, always looking at the world blind to how fucked it actually is.
just seeing this little bald shitstain have even a fragment of happiness in a world that was damned determined to take all mine away made me want to break every, fucking, bone, in, his, body.

so i did. it wasn't nice, wasn't pretty, but I figured he'd survive it.

first I took care of his dad, a quick chop to the back of the head, he was out of it.
kid gives me this look like a puppy cornered by a lion before i pick him up by the arm, and squeeeeze...

and the arm breaks, so goddamned easily, the kid lets out this scream, so I haul him up by the legs, smack him around on the concrete, I'm tryin to be gentle here you understand, I don't wanna kill the kid, and he breaks EASY too, we're talking the sort of flimsy bones that people with medical problems have.

because he DOES have a medical problem, only i don't realize this, nor would i have given a fuck anyway, because the more gentle I had to be, the more it pissed me off.
and the rougher I got.
snapped his legs neck, didn't even give him the dignity of doing it with my hands, just threw him on the ground and stomped em both in half, snapped with what i was expecting to be a satisfying ""crack"" only...
it wasn't a crack, more like a huff, or a shuffle, felt softer'n bones you know?

well, I kept at it before finally catching myself, by this time, the kid's on his last legs and that's when I see that fucking wrist band, words on it show he's been to a hospital for people with terminal fucking cancer.

I thought I knew what misery was? fuck if I did. I heard about this shit, cancer, it's hell, you gotta cope with the worst sorta shit, the treatment is worst than the coping, gives you false hope that you'll somehow survive before going to the equivalent of a bad chinese restaurant and ordering their worst plate, getting sick as fuck for two weeks and then going back for more. not for any reason mind you, just because it's funny to watch people suffer more before they die, because chemo doesn't FUCKING WORK!!

horrified, I ran the fuck away and spent the next five weeks in my apartment, regretting it.
never had it in my mind that i'd gone THAT far down the rabbit hole of nihilism and being a bastard, but well.....fuck it.

so I spent the next five weeks wishing, just wishing I could undo this shit, wishing I could stop it. wishing I could make that kid better so I could be the only one who suffered more than anyone else.
the guilt gnawed at me like nothing i've ever felt, then one day this asshole, an old friend by the name of tony came to my apartment, he looked pretty fucking beat up.

I was pretty pissed, he wanted money for medical so I lashed out at 'im, punched his lights out.
didn't tell me what it was a terminal illness, the man was suffering from cancer, just like that kid, only he didn't have rich parents to send him to get his guts turned inside out by radiation poisoning. so he took out loans, and you know loans, loan sharks...they just love to fuck people up. so I beat up yet another terminally ill person. 
but this time something fucking wierd happened

know how I said earlier i punched his lights out? well I WANTED to, but this weird green glow coated my hands when i threw the first punch, and then when the hit landed his monkeyshine from the debt sharks suddenly magically healed.
he didn't even recoil, just looked at me in shock and said ""Hold it...i feel...weird.""

I was too mad to think, I hit him again, again, and again, he pleaded for me to stop at first, then he just sits there all calm and peaceful-like, staring in confusion.
I stop hitting him and look at my fists, then back at him and say ""congratu-fucking lations, I guess i cured you.""

I show him a mirror and he can't fucking believe it, his face looks great-well, for tony anyway, he still has the face of a monkey, but at least he doesn't look like a dying monkey.

he goes to the doc, cancer's all gone, he thanks me, swears not to tell a soul, and I consider something.
i have the power to heal people by kicking their asses.
not sure how, not sure if it matters, but suddenly, I wanna help that kid a LOT more.

well, turns out he's back in the part, in crutches, I wait for his old man to walk to the shitter then go up to him.
kid gives me this look of terror as i pick him up by the scruff, playing the role of villain again.

pretty much go to town on the kid, not a single one of the punches make him flinch, I hit him wherever I did damage, putting in a few extra shots to his face because I'm still a bastard and we gotta keep that reputation of ours maintained.
the kid passes out from terror, and when he wakes up, bones ain't broke, body's working just fine, and his assailant ain't nowhere to be seen, cause i ain't a rube who does it for the approval.

a week later the boy makes the headlines ""kid cured of terminal cancer by mystery assailant"" or some shit. I don't care.
people out there are calling the mystery man the ""Merciful fist"" the villain who corners sick and injured people and beats the sickness and injury outta em. it's a pathetic title, but...I don't know, I sorta like the idea. now i'm so scary that injuries and terminal illnesses flee at the sight of my fists.
i'd become a doctor if i had the patience to sit through those shitty lectures, but as far as I can see, there's no fucking reason for me to put up with it.

if anyone in this world's gonna suffer the most, it's gonna be me, i'll beat the sick outta anyone who has the nerve to think they have the right to be worse off than me.

that's what I tell myself at least...""",TBAAAGamer1

[WP] A superhero whose punches heal rather than harm. Their origin story is kicking the shit out of a kid with terminal cancer.,BertrandsMate,"""Get out of my way!"" John exclaimed, blasting through the double doors of the hospital and knocking a nurse – 
tray of surgical instruments flying into the air included – to the ground. ""I have a kid to save!""

Behind him, John could hear the fast steps of his follower – he presumed it was Glen, but there was no time to 
stop and talk. He had to get to a cancer kid. *Any* cancer kid.

It had all happened so fast. One minute he was laid lazily on the couch, his left ball hanging from his ripped boxers, playing The Division while Glen did some assignment for school or whatever it was that he did all day, when the old man materialized himself in front of the TV like a goddamned wizard.

""I'm a goddamned wizard!"" the man had said, confirming John's initial suspicion. ""I come from the land of Azarthov with the mission of granting superpowers to humans.""

Glen turned away from his computer and, like John, stared at the old man in a state of quiet desperation, his eyes so wide they were almost coming out of their sockets. ""Did this man just materialized in our living room, John?""

""Oh, shit,"" John, who was hoping he had accidentally bought crack from his weed dealer and was now hallucinating, 
said, realizing that Glen (who was a vegan and never once even smoked a cigarette) apparently could also see the wizard from Azarthov. ""He's real!?""

""I am going to grant you superpowers so you can protect the realm of Earth. One of you will the Punch Healer. You will be granted the power to heal people with punches,"" the wizard said. 

And then John thought back on his life. On how he was twenty five and working at a high school cafeteria and how he had no girlfriend and no car, and how Glen had a girlfriend *and* a car *and* a degree and prospects in life, and how unfair it was that just because you don't study and you like to smoke weed all day you're destined to a shittier life than someone who works and studies.

""I'll do it!"" John screamed, and the wizard cast a golden ray of light from the tip of his fingers towards him. John 
felt his whole body shake and warm up like he had been submerged in warm water.

""I must warn you,"" the wizard said, as he turned to Glen, ""that –""

But John wasn't listening anymore. He sped out from the apartment and ran down the stairs, heading straight for 
the nearest hospital. This was it. He was going to save a kid with cancer's life and start his superhero career. This was his one opportunity to make his life matter, to do something worthwhile, and he wasn't going to stick around for the terms and conditions of his powers, or worse, for the wizard to realize that Glen was *way* more qualified than he was to be a hero. 

&amp;nbsp;

""John wait!"" Glen screamed from behind John, as he kept making way up the stairs of the hospital.

""No, Glen! You won't take this from me!"" John screamed back. ""The wizard chose me, not you! For once, I am going to make a difference! I will be the Punch Batman!""

""It's not what you think, John, just wait!""

John burst through the Radiology door and was propelled into a wide, white corridor. A few abandoned stretchers 
and wheelchairs decorated the place, but there didn't seem to be anyone in the –

And then he saw him. Small kid, sixteen, seventeen tops. Head all shaved, walking slowly past a number of closed doors towards the end of the corridor.

""Imma save your ass, cancer-kid,"" John whispered to himself, sprinting for the kid. He tackled the boy to the 
ground with his whole body, then quickly pinned his wrists to the ground with his knees and started punching.

Once. Twice. Three. Four five six seven eight punches! *Is it weird that this kid is bleeding? I guess it must take a while for the healing powers to take place.* Nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen! *Holy shit he looks really hurt I wonder if I punched the cancer out of him already. Is he breathing? Should I punch harder? That's really a lot of blood, I can barely see his face anymore.*

""John, for fuck's sake!"" Glen burst through the stairway door and screeched to a halt in front of John, leaning against his knee and catching his breath. He stopped his eyes on the scene in front of him. ""Oh, shit! You just punched a cancer patient to death, John!""

""What? No I didn't,"" John said, though the motionless bloody body under him seemed to contradict this statement. ""I was healing him!""

""The wizard didn't give *you* the healing punch power! He gave it to me after you left!""

John got up. ""What!? Really?""

""Yes, really,"" a low voice came from behind a room door. A second later, the wizard emerged from it and reached John and Glen in slow, peaceful steps. ""You don't have healing punches, John. Glen does.""

The reality of what he had done fell over John suddenly and heavily like a rock tied to another, heavier rock. ""I killed a cancer patient…"" he whispered. He had failed, again. More spectacularly then any time before. He had committed *murder* against an innocent person in his feeble attempt to make his mark on the world. ""I killed a cancer patient,"" he repeated.

""Well, not exactly,"" the wizard said. ""Turn him around.""

John kneeled and pulled the body by the shoulders, revealing a big red swastika stamped to the kid's shirt.

""You killed a nazi, not a cancer patient,"" the wizard said. ""This guy was on his way to room 314 to kill a Jewish kid with cancer. So you actually saved a cancer kid, but not in the way you thought you had.""

John frowned and turned to Glen, who looked even more confused than he did. Then he turned back to the 
wizard. ""Wait. What superpower did you give me, back in the living room?""

The wizard smiled a kind, old man smile. ""You're Captain Failure. You save people's lives by failing to do what 
you're supposed to in a way that accidentally causes the situation to solve itself.""

For a while, no one said anything, and the hospital corridor was quiet like a hospital corridor. Finally, Glen puffed 
his cheek and shook his head. ""Oh, for fuck's sake, that's *so* much cooler than healing punches.""

John smiled and lit a doobie.

The boy opened weary sunken eyes which flashed recognition then fear.
""I don't know how I did this but I think I know how to fix it"".
Moments passed with only a steady beeping from the heart monitor filling the silence.  That the boy was terrified would have been plain for anyone to see.  His eyes were welling with tears.  The visitor shifted weight uncomfortably from one foot to the other as she seemed to wait for a response.
""Look kid, I know what you must think.  It wasn't... at least... I didn't... I mean..."".  Her voice trailed off.
""It was just a hug!  How could I know it'd do this?""
She gestured up and down the length of boy in the hospital bed.  He didn't move.  His eyes didn't leave hers.  Tears were rolling down his face now.
The boy flinched as she stepped towards him.  He saw her fist coming but couldn't move.  Fist connected with cheek and his head snapped to the right.  There was no pain.  An overwhelming sense of relief filled his body and he closed his eyes.  By the time he'd opened them again she'd left.
He didn't really understand the next few days.  Only that he no longer felt sick.  There were so many tests.  When he'd been sick there were tests but these were different.  His parents were happier, and the looks they shared were almost excited.  The doctors were less solemn and the nurses joked more.

Dr Punch slammed the innocent man with the force of a jet engine.  As he flew up into the air his wounds healed, and his eyes opened.

""Thanks Dr Punch! I needed that.  I hope you plan to--"" He was interrupted by the flag pole erupting from his chest.

General Crunch used centrifugal force the pole to fling the limp human at Dr Punch.  Dr Punch flew at the man, and punched him in the solar plexus.  

""Okay, I think I'm about done with this,"" the man said sailing through the air.  General Crunch caught the man in mid-air, and clasped either side of the mans head.  

""Can you heal a splattered head?"" General Crunch asked, holding the man aloft.
Dr Punch hovered a few yards away, calculating the situation.

""Uhh, can you?"" the man asked.

""What do you want General Crunch?"" Dr Punch.

""I want to tear, rip, destroy! It's all I've ever wanted to do! It's my purpose, yet you stop me at every chance."" General Crunch said.

""Of course I do,"" Dr Punch said.  ""It's what I do.  I can't let you kill innocent people.""
""And I'll kill this innocent man too!""

""To what end General? To what end?""

""To feel the pleasure of it!""

General Crunch bit into the mans head, tearing off a massive chunk of his scalp.  The man screamed uncontrollably.  Dr Punch bolted forward, but General Crunch flew away still holding the man.  Dr Punch could hear the gut wrenching crunches as General Crunch gnawed into the mans skull.  The screams stopped after a few minutes, and hundreds of miles of flight.

General Crunch stopped above a waterfall, femur in hand.  He gnawed it as a tourist eats a turkey leg at a theme park.  Then he ate the bone.

""What is wrong with you!?"" Dr Punch yelled.  The forest went silent at his bellow.
""I am nature incarnate. I am hungry.  I am destruction!  Now, I am become death, destroyer of worlds!""

Dr Punch lunged at General Crunch and grabbed his skull.  Dr Punch slammed his head into General Crunch repeatedly.  

""Heal! HEAL! HEAL!!!!""

""You,"" wham, ""cannot,"" WHAM, ""heal"", wham wham wham, ""me!""

Dr Punch backed away.  Hovered in front of General Crunch, the man seemed unharmed.

""Very well then,"" Dr Punch seemed to consider for a moment.  ""Eat me.""

""What?"" General Crunch said.

""EAT ME!""

His mouth wide, fingers ready to clasp, General Crunch didn't hesitate.  He bit into his face first, then neck, taking wild hungry bites.  In a matter of minutes Dr Punch was consumed.  

General Crunch sunk onto a rock protruding from the water near the waterfall.  There he lay for several hours, digesting.  Suddenly he felt nauseous, the world spun, he felt hot.  He dropped his pants and defecated on the rock.  Feeling slightly better he turned to look at his deposit.  

There lay an intact eyeball.  It seemed to be looking directly at him.  He felt suddenly nauseous again.  He squatted once more but felt constipated.  Something clasped his buttocks.  He looked down in shock and horror as the fingers clawed at his hip.  He felt the strange sensation of something exiting his anus under it's own power.  A clawing at his throat.  His heart felt as if it was being pushed into his spine.  Lungs deflating.  A bulge on his back.

His ribs were being pushed through his side, skin ripping, blood pouring from his wounds.  Then, fresh pink skin appeared.  A toe ripped through his abdomen, a knee from his chest.  He felt his body ripped into shredded ribbons, his mind intact.  
His head hit the rock next to the eye in the shit.  

He looked up at the reborn Dr Punch.  

Dr Punch held out his arms.  Blood and body parts came to him, within moments the man was reformed, just as new, just as alive.

""Can you heal me?"" General Crunch asked, words bubbling from his mouth.

""Why should I?""

[WP] A superhero whose punches heal rather than harm. Their origin story is kicking the shit out of a kid with terminal cancer.,BertrandsMate,"My fist slammed into his face. I felt the cartilage in his nose crack under the pressure.
The kid screamed, the cry penetrating the still night. Birds rustled in the trees and flew off at the sound. 

“Please!” He cried, falling to knees. “Leave me alone!”

My foot lunged out and sank into his stomach. The breath left his body audibly. Gasping for breath, he curled into a little ball.

“Loser,” I muttered, looking down at him. 

The balaclava that covered my faced itched like nothing else. Necessary, I thought to myself. My stomach twisted at the pitiful sight before me. A skinny, sickly kid cowering on the ground. His bones jutted out of pale skin, reddened from where the gravel had torn at it. His clothes hung loose, a reminder that he used to be healthy. The papers said he was fourteen when they published the sob story. 

“Only fourteen,” they yelled. “Far too young to die of cancer.”

I leaned down and whispered in his ear, “Fucking rich kid. Always had the best, haven’t you?”

He whimpered, clutching his sides. I interlaced my fingers and pushed against them, relief flooding outwards as I heard the cracks. I stepped over top of him, grabbed his shoulder and spun him round.

“Now you know what it’s like for the rest of us,” I said, balling my hands into fists.




Three days later a news story popped up. A made up, blonde anchor stared out at me, almost as if she were silently judging me eating cereal with bloodied, bruised hands.
“And now, just days after our harrowing report of the teenager with terminal cancer, we have what is being described as a miracle.”

I dropped my spoon into the bowl and held my hands out. I tightened them into fists, watching the skin break, droplets of blood emerging. I glowered at the screen, now a picture of a smiling, healthy boy.

Tiny little snapshot. This is my first time posting on here! Just looking to improve my writing, so I'd gladly take any advice!

[WP] A superhero whose punches heal rather than harm. Their origin story is kicking the shit out of a kid with terminal cancer.,BertrandsMate,"The kid has a bruise on his left cheek, *and it wasn't my fault*.


For the longest time, I derived my self-worth by reminding myself how little others had.  In my halcyon days, this was through my physical prowess, trying the battlefield of youth and coming out on top.


In other words, I was the guy that kicked sand in your face when you were five, shoved dog poo into your back when you were ten, and probably beat the living snot out of your pristine high cheekbones when you were thirteen. In front of your lady friends.


Thus, you might expect me to change when I was told one day after school that my latest victim was a terminally ill child, recently diagnosed with stage four cancer that had spread throughout his lungs, livers, pancreas and various other body parts I didn't care to remember.  Naturally, I cried and apologized on my knees, my eyes so rouge that I made stoners look like children.  I wept on my knees with the grim satisfaction that the child would never know any good in the world.


He was expected to live three months, tops.


Thus, it was only six months later, when my little terminal victim made a turn for the worst. *For me, I might add*.  He got better. In fact, not only did he get better, he got strong, powerful strong, the kind of strong that only boys watching Superman could imagine.  The kind that meant this kid had no idea how to control, strong.


I won't go into details as my flailing arms and weak knees found greater comfort on the playground gravel rather than stand up to this little once bald terminally ill victim of physical and mental bully. *But*, I will say that I did change.  Not by much, but I changed.


Would you punch a puppy if it meant saving it's life? Kick a kitten?  Yell at newborn babies?  Perhaps that's too extreme for you, but I found my niche in life.  


But I found out that the greatest thing isn't saving another's life. It's punching a baby in the face, *and* taking it's candy.",imakhink

I ran past the doorway to John and slammed my fist into his mouth. The numerous shrapnel wounds in his neck and face started to fade immediately. I rocked him again to make sure he didn't feel the concussion and then got myself in the arm too. I was feeling pretty shell shocked from the blast as well. 

Sound came back. ""Chris! Louis took a round to the femoral get in here now."" I ran in, Louis made it through that fight too, after I let him have one right in the kisser.

Their origin story is kicking the shit out of a kid with terminal cancer.,BertrandsMate,"It all started twenty years ago, when a drug-fueled teenager with a temper came across a young boy sitting on a wheelchair, all by himself in a deserted park on a Sunday evening.

""What you doing out here by yourself?"" I said, staggering over to him.

""Hi,"" he said. ""Doc said I've got two days left, so mom's taking me around the neighborhood. You know, see some friends, say goodbyes.""

""Where's your mom now?""

He looked like he wanted to shrug but his shoulders were too weak. ""Dunno. Buying something from the store, I guess.""

""Listen, man, you got any money?"" I said. Without waiting for an answer, I began  undoing the clasp of his watch.

""Hey, what're you—don't take that! My dad gave me that!"" He grabbed my wrist with a limp hand. Before I knew what I was doing, I punched him across the face.

""Don't touch me,"" I roared. ""You're going to die anyway!""

""No,"" he said, only to be met by another punch. ""Please—""

""Let go!"" Our tugging led to him toppling from his wheelchair. In my blind rage, I began kicking him in the belly. He squealed, almost like a piglet, from each blow. His legs, which had been still the entire time, began to thrash as well.

Finally, pulling my arms free from his hands, I ran. I didn't even think about my actions then.

It was only two days later that I realized what I'd done just for a couple of beers. He would've been dead by now, but only because I'd killed him.

***

'cept the poor bastard didn't die. I only remembered because he appeared in the news, hale and hearty, standing proud beside his weeping mother. Every paper, every channel, was calling him a miracle.

Of course, back then I thought so too. Now, years later, I knew better. I stood before a wall in my room plastered with newspaper cuttings and magazine articles, of children who've been on the brink of death and lived. Men who've had limbs detached, only to regain them with little more trouble than simply sticking the parts back on. Women wasted away by disease, now out in the world doing great things.

All because of me.

I strode in front of the mirror and struck a pose: pecs trust out, hands on my hips, butt to the side. I've gone by so many names. The Man Who Punches Cancer. Germbeater. Hospital Crasher.

But most recently, I'd been officially given a designation by the city, after I saved more than sixty dying children at a care center.

I am the Bad Touch.

And it was time for me to go to work.

***

""Don't worry,"" I said to the parents standing by the bed. They always worried, for some reason. ""This won't hurt a bit.""

The mother bit her lips and nodded, allowing her husband to pull her back.

Their daughter lay before me, comatose. A horrible fall had broken something in her skull. Doctors couldn't do anything, which was where I came in. Well, I usually came in whether they wanted me to or not. Hospital Crasher. Good health before the whims of man.

""Here comes the bad touch!"" I shouted, and slammed both fists into her chest.

She jerked awake with a cry. At once, the nearby doctors and nurses came running, along with security. I only had a bit of time before their hesitation to chase me away was overruled by protocol.

""Don't worry, dearie,"" I told the coughing girl, patting my biceps. ""My slabs'll take care of you."" With that, I threw a flurry of punches into her face, burying her in the folds of her pillow. Her mother sobbed behind me as her father comforted her.

Within minutes, it was over. She was dancing with her laughing and crying parents, and security guards were half-heartedly chasing me from the building. I ran with a spring in my steps, head held high. Another child saved. Death denied once more.

My next target was across town, at an old facility, requiring me to take a cab. This request had come in my email. Young boy, dying of cancer, paralyzed. The guards let me in without a word. Strange, usually they asked a ton of questions.

As a nurse led me to the third floor, I couldn't help but feel uneasy at the state of the place. It was rundown; filled with outdated equipment, grim-looking staff and few patients at all. Once, I even saw a rat slip out from a crack in the wall to dash among slippers.

""In here,"" she said, opening a door to a ward. Right after I walked in, she slammed the door behind me and locked it. I gave it no thought, however. A kid here needed my help.

He was sitting by the window, on a wheelchair, looking outside with dull eyes. His body was emaciated, and he didn't even turn his head when I knelt by his side.

""Son, you're a real champ,"" I told him quietly. ""But you're in for a beating.""

""I thought so too,"" said a voice behind me.

I spun around to face a young, clean-shaven man wearing an expensive-looking suit. He was smiling and fingering a tarnished watch on his wrist.

""Who're you?"" I said.

He smiled even wider and gestured at the boy. ""I'm not what's important right now. Doctors say he only has two days. Can I watch you work?""

""Two days is plenty,"" I said, standing up. ""Answer my question.""

""Don't you remember me? I used to sit in a chair like that, once. Until someone tried to rob me.""

That watch ... the pieces clicked into place in my mind. ""You? What're you doing here? What's all this?""

He shrugged and swept his hand around. ""This dump? I own this place. You gave me a second chance, and I wasn't going to waste it.""

""Emerson Care,"" he announced suddenly. ""That's my name, by the way. I never got the chance to tell you. Or thank you.""

My eyes went wide. ""Emerson. Lucas Emerson? You're on the city's medical board. You own ... you own almost all the private hospitals here.""

""And care centers, treatment centers, pharmacies, medical research labs ... the list goes on. You see, ever since you saved my life, I've been a tad ... interested in healthcare.""

""Good to hear that,"" I said, preparing to flex my muscles. Corporate executives loved that.

He pursed his lips. ""Yeah, not so great when someone's running around town healing everyone. Occupancy rate's shit these days. Profits are down, and I can barely keep the lights running in some of them. This place, for instance.""

That sense of unease tripled. ""Why have you brought me here?""

Lucas grinned, but his eyes were cold. ""People don't need a miracle, Bad Touch. We aren't designed to live forever. When old age comes, people need beds, and rest, and medicine. I give them all that. I don't need a charlatan taking all that away from them. You're a false prophet. And I cannot allow you to keep doing what you do.""

The door opened once more, and two men in suits came in. Both were huge and intimidating.

""Way I see it, you have a choice."" Lucas pointed at the child behind us. ""You can keep healing them. I'm not against that. I don't forget my roots. But you do it when I say you do. I don't lose all my profits; you get to keep some of them alive. Win-win.""

""And if I refuse?"" I said, fists clenched.

""Then we'll see if your own fists work on you."" He snapped his fingers, and his men strode toward us. ""But think fast. Consider your time window ... terminal.""

[WP] A superhero whose punches heal rather than harm. Their origin story is kicking the shit out of a kid with terminal cancer.,BertrandsMate,"I flung the door open. There was the little shit. Dumb kid had been a prodigy, stealing all of my greatest ideas and scientific discoveries and publishing them as his own. Of course evidence had surfaced that this worthless scum had been stealing my work, but that wasn't the story the people of Metropolis wanted to hear. So the media fed them something else: ""Boy with terminal cancer leads discovery of breakthrough procedure to heal cells in the body, Doctor steals credit"". Somehow it was I under investigation for this fraudulence. I was a scientist, James Geoffrey Goddard III. He, was a kid with terminal cancer and an evil network of spies. He was my arch-nemesis. He'd been doing this for the last few years, so, when I had finally isolated the compound, I took to carefully logging all of the results by hand.  Somehow, this dumb bitch had found the data and published it as his own. Sure, maybe the kid had discovered it on his own. After all, The Dish a Wish foundation had given him his entire own lab to work at. 750 million worth of research equipment. But there was no way he had discovered it himself, the data is far to similar to that of my own. He's just a boy, he can't be mature enough to undergo the painstakingly long process I endured. He was lying. But, I had one advantage in my court though: I knew this drug could give super human strength under the right conditions. So I hatched a plan: I'd set his laboratory on fire and ""rescue him"". But before I revealed my heroism, I would first teach him a lesson. He could handle it I was sure, at the age of 14 he was ready to be a man. I recognized how dark my plan was, but I would have no remorse, I was soon to have all of my research grants nullified and my station removed from my care because of this boy ""genius"". 

When the day came, all went precisely to plan. Almost. The procedure with the drug was simple. Smash to powder then snort that shit. Lighting his laboratory on fire was simple too. His laboratory erupted into flames nearly immediately, and I had only a few minutes before the flames reached the oxygen tanks. Searching for him was the bitch. I set to finding the shit-eater. I truly hated how big the facility was; he deserved nothing of the sort. I flung door after door open to find nothing. Where was this little shit stain?! I was running out of time and had only a door remaining. A big green door. I smashed my fists into the door and flung it open; this had to be it. 

There he was, staring back at me in his little rollie-seat:

""Hello James. It... heh, sure took you long enough."" He smirked and giggled a little.

I was stunned, but I had no time for games with this sick piss licker. 

""You piece of fuck"" I screamed as I raised a fist into the air and smashed his face in at full force. I could feel my anger surge, my veins bulge. I kept swinging, beating the ever-loving shit out of him. 

But nothing changed, he began to darken and his hair was thickening. Suddenly he was becoming stronger and...god-forbid happier!? 

I grabbed him by his legs and smashed through a window that was conveniently overlooking a large bin of...we're those mattresses? We fell three stories directly onto the soft comforters. I felt my power begin to drain as my natural adrenaline died away. 

The media was already there, flashing pictures of us, reporting on the heroic deed I had done. The moment was brief, and after several interviews I returned home and sat on my couch in astonishment. How did that little media-whore know I would be there? Why were there so many mattresses right below that window? I flicked on the television to the headline ""Dr. Goddard or Ultra-man? Hero saves prodigy cancer patient from burning laboratory"". I walked to the kitchen, looking to quench my munchies. My cell phone began ringing. I hesitantly answered. 

""Hello James. I'm cured. YOU cured me. You have given me the chance to cure the planet once and for all. You have saved more than you could ever possibly know""

""Who's this? What did I cure Earth of?"" I responded in fear. But I knew. I knew exactly what this little fuck wanted.

""I will cure this planet of our poisons, Doctor Goddard. Of our species. I know you know who I am Doctor. I will end humanity's reign over Earth. I will start with Metropolis. Oh, which reminds me. I thought it'd be fun to have a suit made for you. 'Metro-Man'"" He said in some sarcastic form of awe. ""It's in your closet. I look forward to your next visit, you'll look dashing. Anyways, I have to go; I've got a world to save.""

And he hung up. And that was all. And I was the only one who knew the bitch had to be stopped.",KeplerOrion

[WP] A superhero whose punches heal rather than harm. Their origin story is kicking the shit out of a kid with terminal cancer.,BertrandsMate,"You know you're fucked when you have a the Make-A-Wish people coming into your hospital room. I certainly knew that and was still filled with normal teenaged angst when I told them my wish is to have a real life superhero visit me. My name is Johnny and I was 13 with terminal brain cancer. I didn't know at the time it was terminal, the doctors and my parents sort of skirted around the subject, but when Make-A-Wish came in, I knew I was fucked. They were all smiles and motivated and at the time I figured they were just trying to make themselves feel better for whatever they did wrong in their life. I tried to make an impossible wish and ruin the whole organization-because, you know, the teenage angst. 

Well, about a week later they were back. They had a photographer with them and some older kid with a notepad and pen. I figure now that he must have been an intern or a really new journalist. I was surprised with how fast they work, maybe I was supposed to die really soon to that. Next, they're saying some stuff to me and I wasn't paying attention because I was freaking out a little bit but trying to look tough, and then the door to my room opened. Some guy that was probably six and a half feet and pretty athletic looking walks in wearing a green one-piece costume. He looks like some cheap superhero from a cereal commercial. They must've gotten this guy from an acting audition; all I knew was he was not a real superhero and not what I expected. It was a joke. 

He said some stuff about how he heard a boy was in need of help and came flying in as quick as he could. He was super excited and had a deep voice that made him seem strong and heroic. He had the stereotypical hero act down for sure. I wasn't excited at all for this guy. I know I asked for a real superhero, but this was so far from a serious superhero. I remember just being mad at this joke of a hero coming into my room from the Make-A-Wish people. I must've looked mad or upset because he came up to me and put his hand on my shoulder saying he would do everything in the world's power to make me feel better. I remember shoving him off me and yelling at him. I yelled at him about him being a joke and how he couldn't save a mouse from a snake that just saw it across the room. I remember being so angry about the situation and just directing all my anger at this guy even though he didn't deserve it. I said some terrible things, and must have really hit some soft spots on him from how he was reacting.

The next thing I knew, police were in the room handcuffing the superhero. My face hurt too and I realized he hit me. I don't know if I blacked out, but I don't remember any of the stuff I said or him hitting me, but he definitely hit me. My face hurt pretty bad, and he was still just staring at me with hate in his eyes. I didn't ask anyone what I said to him, and frankly I don't want to know.

Some time had past since then, like a few months. I was feeling a lot better and the doctors came in smiling to my room. The first time they were truly smiling and happy since I had checked into the room. They said to my parents and me that the cancer was completely gone and they wanted to take me off my meds to see how I react. My parents were ecstatic, and I was happy too that I'd get to live. Make-A-Wish even guaranteed to pay all my hospital bills if I never told anyone about what happened. I guess I'm telling now, but that was years ago. I recently tried to enquire about that fake superhero and found out he ended up in jail for hitting me. I wanted to tell him I was cancer free and apologize for whatever I did. I wasn't allowed to talk to him though, so I never did get to apologize. He did end up in the news though; he was a legend in the jail. Anyone with any pain or disease would be cured after the beat them up. I figured out that he wasn't some fake superhero and actually was a real superhero like I asked for. I hope Make-A-Wish doesn't realize and ask for their money back. But again, that was years ago, and the real superhero can hopefully visit more kids in the hospital and beat up more terminal cancer kids. ",jayk21

He closed his eye, thinking it's time to go. It's time for the grim reaper to bring him to the promised land. The door creak opened, footsteps echoed through the room, louder and closer each step. ""It's time for me to go"", john think calmly. 

Embracing the thought of death, john felt a light touch against his thigh. He opened his eyes and saw a little boy. The little boy looked at him and smile, holding out his fist motioning for a fist bump.

""Nice sense of humors the death god have"", john thought. ""I guess I have to go out with a bang."" John lift up his weaken fist and the little boy swiftly fist bump him.

[WP] A superhero whose punches heal rather than harm. Their origin story is kicking the shit out of a kid with terminal cancer.,BertrandsMate,"""So our next Guest is a real life Superhero, someone who can heal people by punching them! Please give him a hand!"" And that is my cue, I wander onto the Stage while the Audience is applauding. I nod to them and shake the hand of the Moderator, Crissy Anders, a very attractive and very successful host of a late-night show.  
""Thank you Crissy."" I smile and take a seat. As the audience goes quiet, Crissy looks at her cue cards and turns to me. ""So you heal people by punching them?""  
""Indeed! There is nothing to add. I take the pain away by bringing the pain.""  
""I understand the need to protect your Identity with a gift like that so you became a Superhero and every Superhero worth a Salt you do have a name?""  
""People call me 'Happy Slapper' but I prefer 'Whole Puncher'."" This gets a decent, pleasing chuckle out of the Audience. I revel in those moments because I know where this conversation is heading.  
Crissy smiles her best smile, ""Clever! So... I have to ask: How on earth did you find out about your talent.""  
I shuffle uncomfortably in my seat, looking at the audience for strength but due tho the bright lights I can only see vague shadows of people.  
""I... uh.... Well, you see..."" Stammering is the best I can do, Crissy is still smiling but her look is pressing me to go ahead.  
^^""I ^^punched ^^a ^^kid ^^with ^^terminal ^^cancer.""  
Her facial expression changed noticeably and with her being professional that says a lot.  
""I'm sorry, come again?""  
A heavy sigh escapes my lungs, ""I beat up a kid with terminal cancer."" And with that the crowd goes silent, stunned by what they just heard. So stunned that they even forget to 'boo'.  
""Listen, I'm not proud of what I did and there is no excuse but let me tell you how it went: One afternoon I was really plastered after lunch, and there was a bald Kid just calling me names and making fun of me... And being a plastered idiot my reaction was to punch him, thinking it was a person with dwarfism. I mean a bald 12 year old?"" Another sigh, ""Turns out chemo does that to a person. Someone called the Police and an Ambulance, I was taken into custody where I spent five hours. Here is where it gets weird- well weirder. I was released and suddenly two strangers hug me. The parents of the kid as it turns out. The Hospital did not only *not* find any indications of an alteration but there was also no trace of cancer in his body. They were convinced I was an Angel and I just saved their Kid which looked like I hit him. They did not press charges and I was released.""  
The Audience was still rather silent, either fascinated by my story or they could not decide if I was truly an Angel or the most repulsive person on earth.  
""And this was when you discovered your gift?"" Crissy looked almost bemused, probably thinking of the ratings this would bring.  
""Not... directly. I did not connect the dots. A friend of mine did when I told him the story I accidentally elbowed him in the mouth, fixing his toothache that bothered him since a week. He told me we have to test this, so he brought his elderly downstairs Neighbor in.""  
Chrissy looks surprised, ""What did he have?""  
""Prostate."" My reply was rather short and a part of the Audience erupted with laughter.   
The corner of Chrissies mouth twitched slightly upward, ""So.. you...?""  
""I kicked him... in the groin."" Again roaring laughter from the audience mixed with a few grunts of pain by the male demographic. ""But it worked, he even told me that he does not need the blue pills anymore.""  
""That is extraordinary. Do you have any explanation how you got your Powers?"" Chrissy was visibly fighting the urge to laugh.
""Not really, I wasn't bitten by a radioactive Boxer with an M.D. as far as I am aware. In the end I can only heed the call and punch people who are suffering.""  
""Speaking of which,"" she puts her Hand on the Desk, ""I have carpal tunnel syndrome which is quite the bother."" Without saying a word I slammed my fist onto her hand making her yelp in pain.  
""It will stop hurting in a minute or so..."" I take a sip of my water while Chrissy shakes her Hand furiously and trying her best not to resort to expletives.  
""Well this is certainly something else. Thank you for being our guest today, Mr. Whole Puncher!"" She turns to the camera in front of her, ""And after the commercial break our next guest will be Johnny Depp and he will talk about the new Alice film and how he meant to heal his soon-to-be-ex Wife!""",genuineparts

[WP] A superhero whose punches heal rather than harm. Their origin story is kicking the shit out of a kid with terminal cancer.,BertrandsMate,"no way anything worse had ever happened to him. in fact, that was the end of his life as he knew it. also as he didn't, for that matter.

trying to figure out his surroundings one last time, that day's events flashed in front of his eyes, together with the shackles that were, without the shadow of a doubt, about to be locked on his wrists. his own wrists. the ones he had swung ever so flamboyantly all those other times. the same wrists.. well, it wasn't the wrists. more like, what's immediatly after the wrists.

that's right, his hands. vessels of a divine power giving him the ability to heal about any plague or illness, by punching them into infinity. even the most gruesome of wounds wouldn't have stood a chance against his fearsome knuckles. he used to punch people into wellbeing all the fucking time - all of it, no kidding. mental illnesses too - they bore no value or strength whatsoever against those strikes. schizophreniacs, cadavers, even hillary clinton voters. he cured them all with a sound punching to the skull. or the throat. or anywhere. although the teeth were for sure his favourite.

so why had his glorious powers betrayed him on the most important day of his life? why did it all have to come tumbling down on him? questions that kept ringing inside of his skull like a nail, as he was dragged out of the oncology section and into the police car. seeing his own blood-stained reflection, he just couldn't understand.

then he got it.

passerbys were dazzled. a fully grown man being tazed by cops, outside of a hospital, while his would-be screams gobbled out of his mouth and brain onto the asphalt.

he could do nothing. it was too late. but in his mind, his plans started taking form. 'fuck you, op. i have extreme healing punches and you made me *kick* an already suffering terminally ill child to death, you cruel psycho swine monster you ruined everything. but i'll get you someday you dumb fuck. i'm getting out of this prison. and i know where you live. i don't even have to worry about dying of old age. i'll just punch the shit out of myself until i'm out. and then, you're on your own.'",snakecharrmer

[WP] A superhero whose punches heal rather than harm. Their origin story is kicking the shit out of a kid with terminal cancer.,BertrandsMate,"My name is Eric Letterman, and i'm here to tell you that having leukemia is pretty shitty. Even shittier when you're 16. Woah, spoilers, right? Someone call the press! Constantly being in pain and having trouble with simple activities without becoming exhausted. Having to go to a clinic one week out of the month for chemo every day of that week. Hell, even being stuck in a hospital for a week is pretty shitty. 

There are some things that make it easier, ever so slightly. You sort of get to know the regulars. Some of them are amiable enough and conversation can help make it bearable. Arthur, the 17 year who usually shared my room was on a pretty similar schedule to me, so we saw each other for 5 or 6 days of our treatment weeks. They pretty much keep you in bed and check on you to monitor your reaction to the therapy, so options for entertainment are pretty limited. Arthur and I would trade stories and swap riddles until one of us fell asleep or between meals. Anything to pass the time. 

     ""Alright, what tastes better than it smells?""

""Eric, you're getting soft on me! A tongue. Come on man, you already used that one!""

     ""Alright smart ass, you come up with one then!""

""What has a head, a tail, is brown and has no legs?""

     ""Arthur you aren't even trying now. A penny!""

""Oh whatever man. Alright, you.""

     ""Young I am tall; Old I am short. I love to glow, and breath is my foe. What am I?""

Silence. The room is dark, but I look over anyway and strain to see if he's okay. Sudden concern grips my stomach.

    ""Arthur? Arthur?""

A gentle snore is emitted from his direction. Looks like he passed out first tonight. Whatever.

    ""Night, dude."" I say as I push the button on the bedside remote, drawing the courtesy curtain. 
 
***

My eyes open slightly as a sliver of soft light cuts through the darkness as the oiled hinges of the door to our room slides open ever so slightly. A dark form slips into the mostly black room. Probably custodians on a late night round. The form passes my bed and the courtesy curtain, obscured from my vision. I can hear the thumps and thuds, struggling to remove a full trash bag from our trashcan I presume. After a brief while the sounds stop and the man slips out of the room, shutting the door gently behind him. In the darkness, my eyelids once more feel heavy. I drift off. 

***

I wake up late, as per usual from staying up. a glance at the clock tells me it's 11. I look over to see the curtain drawn back and Arthur's bed empty. Probably at therapy. A nurse walks into the room and walks with me for my therapy session. 
When I return to our room an hour later, his bed is still empty. 

     ""Nurse Armitage?""

""What can I do for ya darlin?""

     ""Where's Arthur at, do you know?""

""Oh, I'm surprised no one told you. He left us this morning.""

     ""WHAT? What happened??""

""His condition took a dramatic change overnight. When the doctor was called in this morning to assess him he said that there was no point to continue his treatment and decided to let him go. 'There's nothing more I can do' was how he put it.""

Crushed, I sank onto my bed and braced my arms against the mattress just to stay seated upright. He had been fine just last night, and now he was gone. My friend for the past year and a half, passed in a night. Gone, forever. ""Oh."" I said, mumbling the words.

""He's better now hun. Just focus on yourself, mmkay? I've got to go, I'll be back in for you tomorrow morning.""

     ""Whatever.""

Nurse Armitage walked out of the room, her flats making little noise as she stepped down the hall.

How could my friend have passed? How could this have happened?? He had been fine just yesterday, telling stupid jokes and riddles and acting like normal. What went wrong?? Devastated, I sank back into bed. Dinner service came and went, asking why I hadn't eaten as if everything was okay and nothing had changed. As soon as they left, I pulled the covers over me and did my best to pass back into the sweet nothingness of sleep.

***

Awoken again, for the same reason. The darkness of the room broken by a bar of light as the door peels open just enough for the custodian to slip through. I roll over and face Arthur's bed(no one's bed now, I remind myself) and try to fall back asleep. I hear the footsteps cross the room to the empty bed in front of me. Strangely, it sounds like they then draw closer. The footsteps stop, and I look up. 

The custodian stands over me, inches away from the edge of my bed with a pillow clutched in his hands. He shoves the pillow into my face, and I can hear his words right before the pillow presses against me.

""Don't scream, someone will hear you.""
Suddenly, in that moment of terror and confusion, everything became clear.

The custodian slipping into the room at night.
The thumping, the thuds. Not the trash, but Arthur struggling. 
Fighting for his life against this man who killed him while I laid feet away. 
Everything so clear.
Too late.

The first blow slams into my stomach, knocking the wind out of me. A fist, firm and unforgiving as iron. The next strike feels like a hammer making my chest compress, a miracle that nothing breaks. The third blow slams into my forehead, the pillow doing nothing to cushion the punch. The fourth, fifth and sixth follow. 

*thud*
*thud*
*thud*

The pillow lifts, and the room is somehow darker than before and rapidly sinking further into the inky blackness. My last sight is the form of a man shutting the door as the pain claims me, and everything goes blank. 

***

Birds are singing and light is shining through the window's open blinds when I wake. Early in the morning, as a glance at the digital clock reading 7:37 AM can confirm. What a nightmare. It certainly couldn't have actually happened. For one it would be ridiculous. Second, I feel no pain.

the idea slowly clicks in my head. No pain. NO PAIN. 
I leap out of bed to my feet, ripping my vitals monitor's cables off as I go. So full of energy! I laugh, jump for joy, do jumping jacks, run out into the hallway. Nurse Armitage comes sprinting into the room, concerned by the heart monitor's blaring from the disconnected cable.

""What are you doing out of bed Eric?""
     
     ""I don't need to be here anymore, Nurse Armitage. I don't hurt anymore!""

A smile breaks out on Nurse Armitage's face as she exclaims

""First Arthur, now you! It's a miracle, this hospital is full of miracles!!""

     ""Arthur? What do you mean?""

""Why I told you yesterday darling! He made a full recovery, quite spontaneously. refused to be pushed out on a wheelchair and insisted on walking out on his own two feet once the doctor gave his approval! And now you, oh isn't it wonderful?!""

A smile breaks out on my face and a single tear rolls down my face as I finally comprehend what she's saying, and berate myself for being such an idiot. Arthur was fine. I guess I never asked her to clarify, looking back on it. Her fault really, but still. 

***

After someone runs shouting for the doctor and the doctor arrives to look at me, he determines that I've obviously recovered spontaneously, just as Arthur did yesterday. 

""As much as I wish I could claim it was because of me, I can't begin to explain how you made such a spontaneous recovery. Whatever happened, it's beyond me. Your recovery like this is nothing short of the work of Fate or a force beyond our understanding.""

Several exams and tests later, I'm given a clean bill of health and allowed to check out. My parents are called and my mother bursts into tears, announcing that they'll be there in just a moment to get me.

A thousand tearful thank you's to the staff later, my parents and I are walking through the lobby at 11:32 when I see him. A man much older than me, maybe in his late 50's. He pushes a dust mop across the floor of the hospital lobby. Basic black shoes, a dark green coverall, and a well worn looking Oregon Ducks baseball cap. A name patch is stitched into the coverall on the left side of his chest, reading 'Dan, Custodial Services'. 

It's him, undoubtedly. The man from that night, from my dream. It must be a coincidence, i'm sure I saw him before around the hospital and he just showed up in the dream, a semi familiar face. Still, I felt unnerved as I craned my neck to look at him as I continued to walk across the lobby.

***************************************************************

Dan looked up and saw the boy as he walked out, staring at Dan with a mixture of fear and confusion on his face. Dan stopped what he was doing for a moment and put the index finger of his right hand up to his lips, then gave a conspiratorial wink. The kid's jaw dropped, and Dan couldn't hold back his grin as he broke eye contact and turned his attention back to the floor in front of him. 

One more life saved.

Not quite what I would have expected coming out a kid. Sitting in the hospital bed, kid looks like ET. The picture they used when they proposed this whole idea...it was a lot more flattering. His head didn't look so...big.

""Cadeceus?""

The woman to my right, dark haired a nice rack that made her reporters badge just sway in ehen she turned. Oh right, the reporters. My publicist said it would be great publicity once I told her about my powers. I'm a healer, pretty damn valuable honestly, like a unicorn. But only if I punch someone. And not halfheartedly, I've got to punch them **really** hard like I hate them. When I told her the specifics she went white as a sheet. She jumped the gun; organized an healing event. 

Cancer ward at the local children's hospital. I was legally obligated to punch the cancer our of these children. Now all these people were waiting for me to go Muhammed Ali on a bunch of terminal children. As I looked at the kid, Ethan (?) was his name. Big old coke bottle glasses, staring up at me like a puppy. 

A poor terminally ill puppy, kept on staring at my namesake, the red caduceus symbol on my chest. Or maybe just my chest.

""Kid,"" I say with a forced smile, ""this is going to hurt me a lot more than you.""

The first blow knocked him out of the bed. That got some instinctual gasps out of the crowd, given they could hear the air snap. I got on top of him as soon as I could and landed another one square in the nose. It was always jarring putting all my force into the punch only to see nothing happening.

He started flailing a bit with the next few, so I--holy crap! The little turd actually tried to cop a feel! ""Now you're going to get it."" I growled.

It stopped being coordinated. I just wailed on him as hard as I could. Started hitting him faster and faster as the color started coming to his face for the first time in years, the hair that started coming for the first time, the soft cries being replaced by giggling. Now that? That just made me angrier.

But I'm no athlete honestly. I tired out in maybe a few minutes. Looking at him on the floor...the picture of health. Doctors actually clapping, the reporters cameras flashing. Some actually congratulating the kid, who was looking at me with a smile on his face.

I'm going to have to invest in a sandbag.

His hero, the city's hero, was greeting the patients in the ICU. What was once a flathead poster on Eddy's bedroom walls was standing before him in all his muscular, well-defined glory. It was Punchkickerman! This far outranked the time when Make a Wish forced the Barefoot Contests to exchange pleasantries with the patients down the hall in the Infectious Disease ward.

""Punchkickerman!"" Eddy shouted meekly from his bed. Punchkickerman peaked his head into the room, smiling softly at the wonderment shown on this young boy's face. Punchkickerman slowly approached the bed. Eddy reached his hands out slowly, hoping to shake hands with the man who he had only heard about from schoolyard gossip. Punchkickerman raised his hands and then...

SMACK. Punchkickerman dealt a blow straight across Eddy's temple.

""Ow, what the fuck man?"" screamed Eddy, shocked at his hero's aggressive nature.

""You can thank me later."" said Punchkickerman ""But for now, it looks like you're in need of a tuneup, boyo."" He then proceeded to remove a wrench from his prominent fannypack and began savagely whaling across Eddy's temple. 

Eddy flinched at the movements and held his hands up to block the blows. ""Stop!! What are you doing? Why are you carrying a wrench? And why do you have a fannypack?"" 

""I have lots of sundries!"" Punchkickerman retorted as he bludgeoned Eddy with not only a wrench, but also with knowledge. The man stopped the beatdown for a minute and placed the wrench on the bedside table. ""Trust me kid, this ol Punchkickerman is gonna have you feeling better in no time."" 

Eddy caught his breath. ""That can't possibly be true, that felt aw..."" He stopped in midsentence, a revitalizing current pulsing through him. This was a rousing strength that Eddy hadn't felt since the Barefoot Contessa helped him roll those grape leaves for the hospital picnic. Eddy felt more than strong: he felt alive. ""How did you do that? Hit me again.""

""You sound like my ex!"" said Punchkickerman, revealing TMI before totally roundhouse kicking the shit out of this young cancer patient. ""This is my secret, buddy. My punches are equivalent to one kilo of medicinal marijuana! So take your medicine... your fist medicine!"" 

""Your dialog needs work.""

"[wp] You are part of the first trials of cryogenics on humans, as a result you are frozen for 50 years, how has the world changed?",Firetornado12,"The first thing I noticed, when I awoke, was the sky. 

It wasn't blue. It was black. And through the glass window there was the black. And there were stars. Even when I closed my eyes, there were stars.

The second thing I noticed was myself. I was naked. And cold. So I wandered across this room in search of clothes. I luckily chanced upon a row of unlocked  locker, so I took a pair of clothes. Now equipped with a lab coat and breezy pants I began exploring for more.

And then shortly after, the third thing I noticed, was that I was utterly, alone. I sought everywhere on this now explored vessel but I couldn't find a soul. Besides the other popsicles, still frozen, there was no one around. And get this. After looking at the cryo pods of the others, we were never meant to be unfrozen at the same time. They were set to be unfrozen, one by one, every twenty five years or so. And there was no staff around, anywhere, because the ship is fully automated.

And the fourth thing I noticed, was all this regret I now had. For fuck's sake I never agreed to this. I never consented to being shipped out of space to god knows where. When I signed the dotted line on the touch pad, it says I was to be kept frozen, on Earth. I was supposed to be able to see the future, in a better time, with people(!) and technology. Not this. Never... this...


Hell if it weren't for all these automated safety features on board, I would have offed myself long ago. But alas, I can't even starve myself in protest.

""We could ask Hera""

Zeus's eyes widened and beads of sweat visibly formed on his long suffering forehead.

""Uh... Shit.... Wait.... I mean... Christ... I mean... no...""

Ares stood and yelled for Hera.

 ""Mother!""

Zeus's face was terrible to behold. 
""To me you are the most hateful of all gods who hold Olympus."" He rumbled
""Forever quarreling is dear to your heart, as are wars and battles.""

 Ares sat back down after making eye-contact with Hermes who nodded vigorously towards his seat. 

Zeus was still stewing. Apollo decided to resolve the situation.

""Ok Daddi-o, we were just fucking with you. It's really none of our business what you do in your spare time. Everyone knows anyway. We're freaking gods.""

Zeus's children stood up and left in single file. Ares looked like he was about to turn back, but Athena kicked him in the back of the knee and Hermes teleported him out before he could do any more damage.

Zeus looked so relieved that it seemed like someone had just taken the weight of the world off of his shoulders. And his sphincter. That had been extremely stressful. He definitely deserved to release some tension. He definitely deserved to release some tension, especially in Thebes. Thebes sounded real good. Definitely no way anything could possibly go wrong in Thebes. No sir.",viomiv

To be honest, I hadn't quite figured out what to call my latest invention. Scary-metal-spitting-thing didn't quite cut it. Fire-arrow-thingamabob wasn't fearsome enough. I decided to call it a bang-bang for the time being.

Now where was I?

Oh, yes. How could a sword fight my... Bang-bang?

*I need to change that name*

When the wizard challenged me, I was a little nervous. I knew I could fight swordsmen but magic users were different. After a few tests, however, I decided that the... Bang-bang... Could fire faster than the wizard could cast his spell. I accepted the challenge.

The wizard raised his staff and started to chant. I saw the orb at the end of his stick thingy glow and immediately raised my bang-bang, looking down the barrel at him. 

Ready... Aim...

*Click*

I stared at the bang-bang in horror, pulling the lever thingy several more times. Nothing happened.

I stared at it for another moment before the realization crept over me. How many test fires had I done before this? 4? 5?

*Oh gods above have mercy*

The wizard's spell hit me and I promptly turned into a frog. The bang-bang landed next to me.

*Note to self,* I croaked, *make it so that it can fire more metal death thingies.*

At least, I tried to croak that. What actually happened was when the bang-bang landed it hit me over the head and knocked me out.

That much I know.

The people around me insist that I need help- that if I do not allow them to poke and prod at me I will harm others as well as myself. They say that all I’ve seen are hallucinations, that nothing is real.

This much I know.

I am not crazy.

The doctor knows it too, although he’s never said it. I can see it in his eyes. In his smug smile. In the firmness he uses when he gives me the shots. In his fear when I lose my temper.

I am not crazy. I know that. And he knows it too.

At night I lay curled up in my bed, watching the clock tick on my wall. When I calm down enough, I can make it stop. Then start. Then stop again. When the clock stops, so does all the sound. The rain outside stops falling, the machines around me stop beeping- their displays freeze on a single screen.

I control time. This much I know.

I control time. And I am not crazy.

The doctor says I am getting worse. The medicine pile gets bigger. They hold me down to give me the shots. I hurt. My arms hurt. My head hurts. The doctor knows. I know he knows.

The clock doesn’t stop anymore. But it does slow down.

I… am not crazy. I’m… not. I control time. I do.
	
They move me to another room. This one doesn’t have a clock. But I can watch the leaves falling outside. I can make them fall slower.

I start spitting out the pills. I start fighting them for the shots.

The brightness blinded, then burned.
	
I hissed in pain as I squinted through the light, trying to bring my arms up to shelter my head. The chains clanked- silver lengths too full of sparkle for me to break. I sobbed as the pain took me, forcing me to curl into a ball as I tried to escape it. 
	
Weak, helpless, mewling.
	
I knew why they feared me. A creature of darkness, of shadow. My eyes were black pits, devoid of colour or emotion. My hair was woven from ebony. My skin, alabaster pale, was a stark contrast to the rest of my features- a reminder of a different sort of darkness, the eternal one.

I did not bruise. It was a fact that enraged them. Every blow, every kick, nothing could mark my skin. It was as though I were carved from stone- unyielding, emotionless and cold.

But despite my appearance, I still felt pain. It still consumed me, devoured me, burrowed its way into my heart and soul.
	
I could still break. I was breaking now. 

The footsteps outside made my heart pound with fear. I knew it would be *her*- their hero, their savior, their favorite daughter. 
	
My tormentor.

The light that scalded me now- that left red burns on my exposed skin- that was her work. The pain and agony that flared through me with every breath came from her blows. 

I forced myself to look up at her, squinting at the halo that blurred her features. 

She smiled back at me and the light around us dimmed slightly. “How are we today?”

I managed a small croak. Better than yesterday.

She knelt next to me, grabbing my collar and pulling me close so she could whisper in my ear. “If only they knew. That’s probably what you spend your days thinking, right? If they knew things would be different. If they could see your heart before your darkness. If they knew my thoughts instead of being blinded by my sparkle.”

The maid of fire smirked at me and I felt my blood chill. “But they don’t. And so here we are- their only hero chained and helpless while their chosen Angel reveals her horns.”

The light was dimming even more as her focus slipped and I could feel my own strength returning to me. 

“They will burn. Every last one of them. They will melt into moonlight, into stardust. All will grow to fear that which they have created. And you, dear friend… You will be left here, helpless to do anything.”

I opened my mouth to speak but was silenced by a vicious kick that left me coughing, lips tasting of iron. She spun around, flouncing out of the door.

The light dimmed further.

I took a breath.

Blackness erupted around me, filling my prison with blacks and blues. I enveloped my world in night and peaceful silence, the chains around my arms shattering.


I screamed- not in pain or sorrow but in triumph. I screamed as I savored the freedom I never knew.

I screamed because I could protect those who had chained me.

Once I finally fell silent, she was slumped against the wall, unconscious. I looked at her, then at the walls that had held me, then at the remnants of my old chains.

I fell to my knees. And I cried. ",TheBrightLord

People get to vote on who gets what powers for five years, you are campaigning for the powers of your choice.",WaveRectifier,"I peeped from backstage one last time, my speech was ready. Channel 6 news were doing their introduction and the crowd had settled down. The turnout at the rally surpassed all my expectations. My fists clenched in excitement. 5 more minutes to the start.  

""Oh my God ! Captain Planet!"" Someone outside the hall shouted. Gasps escaped the place as people looked to where the voice came from.  I looked out a window and cringed in disbelief as nature's savior gently touched down across the street with what looked like a puppy in his hands.  

The press in the room didn't give a second thought. They ran to get a few words from the personification of earth's spirit.  

""Captain Planet what brings you to this side of town are you stepping down for your competitor?"" a journalist asked. Their sound system was connected to the Public Address system everything was relayed to the crowd.  

He flashed pearly whites not even polished ivory could compare to ""On the contrary Cindy, I was just dropping this baby seal off I found him washed out tangled in a net and thought Sea World down the street would be a great place for it while I looked for its family.""  

The creature barked as if on cue and he kissed its forehead. The crowd, my crowd, melted, coos and awws of admiration were heard throughout the room as they ate it all up. I had to do something.  

I walked down the podium to him ""Woah there Captain Planet! How nice of you to drop by I was just about to talk about you""  

""Frank!"" he said in between a laugh. ""I didn't know you were campaigning I'd have kept a safe distance.""  


""No no it's okay"" I started, ""In fact I want you to come we talk in private on whether I can adopt this creature until you find its mother.""  

""Why Frank I didn't know you were so generous certainly, a round of applause for my opponent."" he said walking with me backstage.  

Behind the curtain we dropped all niceties.  

""At my rally? Come on that's low even for you"" I complained.  

""Well you were the one who made a personal attack against me"" He responded his leaf-green eyes barely blinking.  

""Personal? Your father is the head of several nuclear reactors that don't dispose of waste safely. I had to show the conflict of interest.""  

""well people don't care they still chose me."" There was a tense moment of silence.  

I threw my hands in exasperation ""You know what, I'm not even sure I hate you anymore. What I really want to know is who voted to turn a big-oil chief executive into the defender of the environment.""  

""that would be people. People voted for me Frank.""  

The baby seal looked longingly at the scum of the earth. He stroked its head making it bark with joy.  

""Do you even care? Like now, that seal, do you care for it.""  

He gave it a second kiss. ""This baby's getting me re-elected only its mother could care for it more than me.""  


""Thanks for offering to take care of it but I have to go now, think I see the place is closed. I'll announce later on that I adopted it so be prepared."" He walked towards the backdoor that took him to an alley away from prying eyes.  

I watched him gracefully floating away unlike the wind he'd taken out of our campaign sails. He'd made sure those were violently blown away the moment he touched down. The rally progressed but I could see it in their eyes the winner of this election before we even got to the booths.  

Later I went to a local diner to get something to eat. As I waited a man sat opposite me.  

""You know you're good"" he started, ""But you're starting too big if you aimed a bit lower honestly we could help you win.""  

I looked around. No one else was joining us, ""Who's we?""  

""We're a group of people fairly impressed by you and could be willing to help with your campaigns."" He slid a card across the table to my plate.  

""If you're interested give us a call"" He stood up and walked away. I tried noting him down but he seemed too generic black suit with a white shirt, plain face 5'9"". A part of me knew I'd forget him the moment he was out the door. In the news Captain Planet was cleaning up an oil spill and not that it was bad but I knew he was probably in the meeting that approved the risky, inefficient, cost cutting, drilling techniques. Someone needed to take him down but that was no easy picking, rarely would an incumbent lose. The card I was given was now in my pocket I took it out. All it had was a number scribbled on it. Why wait for tomorrow? I took my phone out and made the call.

[WP] A small girl which travels the world known as the Iron Owl.,Your_Dogs_Cat,"The large pointy hat wavered from side to side, as it made its way through the large crowd. People quickly scurried to make way, recognizing the girl almost hidden beneath. Lana Renheim, more commonly known as the Iron Owl, had come to the city of Storn. The sorceress prodigy, who mastered every school of magic, was well known for embarking on a journey to visit each city on The Archipelago in search for more knowledge.

Pulling the hat down more, Lana scowled at the forming crowd and picked up the pace, almost running at this point for the nearest inn. The fans followed shouting, asking for autographs, and bombarding the girl with countless questions. Having reached the entrance, the Iron Owl turned around and screamed:

""No! No! No! No autographs, no questions, no stories, get out!"" Lana's extravagant blue and red outfit fluttered, as she continued shouting. ""Anyone who doesn't want to get turned into a frog better leave right now!""

Not relying on the effectiveness of her threat, Lana slammed the door and looked around. The tables were mostly empty, a company of four was sitting in the far corner and a couple of loners were scattered around. The sorceress approached the owner, searching for her coin bag.

""Can I have a room for one night, please?""

""Certainly,"" the owner answered. ""That will be ten silver.""

Unfortunately, fame didn't always come with money. Lana's face went red as she finished counting what little there was in the bag.

""Well, the thing is..."" the girl began.

""I will pay for the lady,"" a sudden voice interrupted.

A young man in leather armour with a sword at his side placed ten coins on the counter and, after some thought, added five more.

""And give her a drink of her choice,"" the man finished.

""Great, another admirer,"" the sorceress mumbled under her breath.

""No,"" he answered, smiling, ""just wanted to help out.""

Lana's face lit up again.

""Don't worry, I'm not angry. I see you have some problems with unwanted attention,"" the man continued. ""I'm Sir Randell, a knight from The Order of the Rose. If you want to, you can join me at my table with that drink.""

Having said that. the knight turned on his heels and walked back to his seat. Grabbing a cup of barley tea, Lana followed.

""So,"" Randell asked after several minutes of small talk. ""Who are you anyway?""

The sorceress almost choked on her tea.

""You mean you really don't know me?""

Randell shook his head.

""Lana Renheim, the sorceress prodigy? The Iron Owl? The travelling mage?"" Lana accompanied her questions with large gestures. ""Rings a bell?""

""No,"" the knight shrugged, ""sorry.""

Lana waited a few minutes, expecting this to be some sort of joke, but soon her expression changed from dumbfounded awe to a smile.

""Well, maybe that's for the better,"" she continued, much more calmly.

""So why do they call you the Iron Owl?""

""Because of this thing."" Lana pulled out a large metallic statue of a bird out of her bag and placed it on the table. ""That's Sarrares, a demon I captured and imprisoned inside an iron owl. He helps me with magic. Unfortunately, he's been quiet for the last few months. I'm searching for a way to fix him.""

""Sounds interesting..."" Randell cocked his head at the owl and suddenly sighed. ""A sorceress like you probably wouldn't need the services of a knight, would you?""

Lana looked down at her cup and went quiet. After several minutes, she spoke up again:

""Hey, would you like to know a secret?""

Randell didn't answer.

""I'm so sick of lying about this."" The girl took off her pointed hat and placed it on the table, covering half the table. ""I'm a fraud.""

""What?"" This time it was the knight's turn to choke on his drink. ""You just boasted about how famous you are. All of that couldn't have been a lie.""

""It's simple, really. I only told you two lies."" Lana looked down, trying to look even smaller than she was. ""First, I didn't imprison Sarrares, I just found the owl one day and it started helping me. Secondly, he doesn't just help me with magic. I haven't cast a spell on my own in my entire life. I'm just not good at it.""

Tears were forming in Lana's eyes.

""That's why I hate fans so much,"" she continued really quietly. ""I'm afraid one day they'll find out about who I really am and everyone will call me a liar. I didn't want to become famous. I just messed around and eventually rumours spread. Now I'm in too deep to back down. Even if I went back to magical school, the teachers would likely throw me out and expose me. My only hope is to make this stupid owl work again. Not to mention that some famous black mages apparently decided to hunt me down. I won't even stand a chance if they find me.""

Lana began sobbing.

""Well..."" Randell said, scratching the back of his head. ""I sort of lied to you too. I'm not a knight, not even a squire to be honest. No one at The Order of the Rose wanted to take me up so here I am, searching for someone famous enough to hire me. That way I could get a name for myself and prove that I'm worth something.""

Wiping off the tears, Lana stood up, put on her iconic hat and spoke loud enough for anyone in the inn to hear:

""Well, Sir Randell from The Order of the Rose, I hear you wish to accompany me, the great and only Lana Renheim, the Iron Owl, on my journey to every corner of The Archipelago. Do you swear to fight by my side, protect me in hour of need, and, if needed, give your life for my safety and honour?""

Randell bent one knee and answered:

""I do.""

Looking up he winked. Pulling her hat even further down, Lana winked back.",Pyronar

Aboard the JSS Sukaikoto*

The twinkling lights of Earth's vast metropolis glimmered as the Sukaikoto orbited the homeworld in low orbit. The lawyer sipped his tea, staring at the blue-orange marble. He could just make out the coastline of East Asia, the sprawling cities in China, New Korea, and Japan illuminating the landmasses in an orange glow. Behind him, several datapads were stacked on a table, each containing terrabytes of information.

The window flashed for a brief second as a silhouette appeared in the tempered glass. Its outline was represented by bits of ones and zeroes. The otherwise incorporeal figure walked in the window to the lawyer's face. ""Sir, are you certain that you are ready for this case?"" it asked in an impeccable electronic voice.

""I'm more than ready, Kasohisho,"" the lawyer said to his virtual assistant, sipping his tea.

""Sources state that your opponent has compiled 18.36 petabytes of information, including several brainwave recordings taken from witnesses. You merely have 19 terabytes of information. With all due respect, the defendant is worried. Perhaps it would be prudent to search for more information. The trial is in a matter of hours. It would not be difficult to obtain double the information you currently possess by that time.""

""Kasohisho, it is not the quantity of information that this case rides upon. It is the quality of information. I would have thought you had known this by now,"" the lawyer said to his assistant.

""Of course, sir. You are the lawyer, after all.""

The lawyer passed the hours staring at the planet through the window, drinking tea and merely waiting. This case was one of the hottest of the century. CEO of Saturn Mining Corporation Tim Dosei had been murdered in his office. The stock of SMC had fallen drastically since and Interstellar Metals Inc had been blamed for the murder. SMC pinned the murder on the son of IMI chairman Jason Kinzoku. Worse, they had him buried under a slew of other charges. Fraud, homicide, corporate espionage, theft, trespassing. But the lawyer knew the truth. He knew what truly happened.

When it was finally time for the trial to begin, the lawyer entered the court room. The defendant stood in the center of the court room, his arms and legs bound in the prone position by electromagnets. The lawyer took his seat, opened his briefcase, and prepared for the legal battle of his life. The trial that could make or break his career. If he lost this case, he would go down in history as the foolish lawyer who planted the final nail in the coffin of Interstellar Metals Incorporated. But if he won, he would be known to all as...

""Now that Mr. Wright is here, we may begin,"" the judge said. ""This court is now in session. Mr. Edwards of the Saturn Mining Corporation has the floor.""

A balding man stood, haughtily pacing the floor of the courtroom. ""Thank you, your honor. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my client has lost enough. He lost his father, he lost a life-long mentor, and he lost quite a bit of money in the fallout from this murder. Let's make this quick so we can all go home and so my client can rest easy, knowing his father's murderer saw justice. Without the shadow of a doubt, I can say that Tim Dosei was murdered by Lawrence Kinzoku.

I present to you the final moments of Tim Doesei, captured from what we could gather from his brain. Given that he died from a shot to the head, the evidence is not as complete as we would have liked, and for that I apologize. Our coroner is not a miracle worker. Your honor, if I may present the evidence on the viewscreen.""

""Granted. Display.""

The window to the courtroom overlooking space flashed for a moment as a hologram played.

*Tim Dosei sat at his computer, running the numbers for the previous fiscal years. In the background, classical music played, some of these songs being over a thousand years old by now. The feed jumped for a minute, the brainwave being incomplete. There was a sharp knock on his office door.

""Come in, Mr. Dosei said.

The door opened, a man entering the room. His features were cast in a silhouette, featureless and vague.

""What are you doing here?"" Dosei asked, already angered at the presence.

""You're a relic of a bygone era-"" the  figure said before the feed jumped. He raised his gun, aiming at Mr. Dosei's chest.

""&lt;unintelligible&gt;, why are you doing this?"" he asked to the figure.

""It's just business,"" the figure said, firing three rounds into Tim Dosei's chest. A surge of DMT distorted the feed at the end as Tim Dosei passed away.*

""As you can see, your honor, the defendant entered the office, killed Mr. Dosei, and took out the only competitor to Interstellar Metals Incorporated,"" the opposing lawyer said.

""OBJECTION!"" Phoenix said, pointing at the opposing lawyer.

""What is the meaning of this? Your honor, Mr. Wright is clearly in contempt for the court,"" the lawyer said.

""Granted, Mr. Wright,"" the judge said.

""Thank you. Mr. Edwards, prior to the recording that Mr. Dosei was shot in the head, that shot ending his life. Yet, in the brainwave recording,we can clearly see that Tim Dosei was shot in the chest. Your honor, the shot to the head was post-mortem, clearly to tamper with the evidence. Furthermore, the murderer was known to Mr. Dosei in a familiar way. My client never had formal contact with Tim Dosei.""

The jury gasped as Mr. Edwards fumbled through his words. ""Your honor, Mr. Wright is clearly mistaken,"" he attempted to say.

""Now, let's take a look at what was said. Mr. Dosei was not on good terms with the murderer. The only person in SMC that Mr. Dosei was on bad terms with was his own son! Your honor, I call Henry Dosei to the stand.""

""Granted,"" the judge said. Phoenix walked to the man.

""Henry Dosei, you are noted in as many as fourteen board meetings saying that the victim's methods are outdated,"" Phoenix said.

""Yes, Tim Dosei was using diamond drills instead of gas jets to mine asteroids, yielding less rock,"" Henry Dosei said.

""These methods infuriated you. In fact, you have stated that you look forward to inheriting the company. Tim Dosei, however, had adrenal implants, providing him with chemicals that delay aging. He had another century of life left. You couldn't wait that long! You wanted the company now. Then, before his death, Tim Dosei enacted a number of contingency plans to fracture his company if he died. He knew that you wanted the company and he ensured you only inherited a fragment of what you wanted.

You couldn't take it. In a fit of rage, you killed your father and blamed your competitor, ensuring that your sphere of influence would expand to fill the power gap left once you drove down IMI's stock.""

""That's enough, Mister Wright. I believe the jury would like to deliberate the evidence,"" the judge said.

________________________

After hours of discussion, the jury returned.

""Has the jury reached a verdict?"" the judge said.

""We have, your honor. We, the jury, find Lawrence Kinzoku not guilty of all charges. We motion for a murder trial to be held for Henry Dosei,"" the jury said.

""Granted,"" the judge said.

The courtroom burst into applause as Phoenix Wright stood up. While the trial was over, he still had a job ahead of him. The prosecution of Henry Dosei and restitution to IMI. But for now, he celebrated. He was Phoenix Wright, Space Attorney.",Dictator4Hire

[WP] Story about legal drama set in space,fellowmartian,"""They killed them.""

Camilla rubbed the back of her neck where her collar chafed. ""Legally, Ruuf...""

The alien slammed a grey tentacle into the table hard enough to leave suckermarks on the glass top. ""*Fuck* legally! Those Pales enslaved us and then they kill us. They just keep doing it. Again and again."" 

This was just another night on the *Magna Carta*, the terribly named ship that functioned as a law firm whenever a disaster happened on one world or another. Many of the industrial colonies had no need for anything other than a contract office and a Justice in good times; it was cheaper for the lawyers to be mobile. 

""And then they make us clean up our own dead,"" noted Jackson from the corner, sipping at his scotch with one hand and running the other through his grey hair. Only the slight blue tint of his skin under the florescent lights hinted that he wasn't fully human.

Ruuf wanted to knock the mountain of paperwork off the table. But they'd been working all night. Working to defend the corporation whose actions had led to the death of another three people. Miners this time. Last case it had been roughnecks drilling for the gas the Pales only called Dust. And the case before that had been a civilian shuttle crash.

Each time the *Magna Carta* set course, it was always towards death. Workplace accidents. Negligence, usually. Sometimes it was rebellions, although they were not a criminally focused ship. 

""I'm done. I can't do this any more."" Ruuf felt dry. Like he hadn't touched water in years. 

""You signed a contract."" Camilla was always the detached one, even though she was the youngest and newest. She had cut her teeth articling in criminal courts and it seemed to have quickly desensitized her. It had made her accustomed to death, at least, and the things that death was preferable to.

""My great-great-grandparents signed a contract! Putting me in the position where I thought... I don't know, that they'd treat their housepets better than their field animals!""

Jackson snorted. ""Dumb thing to think.""

Camilla rose, striding to the bar to pour herself a glass of vodka. Her hands were steady despite the old scars on them. ""You know you can't really leave.""

""Manual labour is better than this. It's honest.""

""You believe that? Mining their resources? Cleaning their buildings? That doesn't serve their purpose any more than this does? Just because you don't have to think about it?""

He slumped into the chair. He could not stop staring at his tentacle. The thing that set him so apart from everything else in this office. He was the only Aquen besides one of the females who worked at the lunch counter.

He was tired of feeling dry. He was tired of everyone laughing at the way he spoke and acted. He was tired of seven years of expensive school never making up for the fact that he had been raised on a traditional rural planet and he would never walk or talk or think like them.

He wanted his family. He wanted the ocean.

""I... I just want to go home.""

The human female drank deeply. ""The Pales made that planet for you. Not for free. You have a debt to pay off.""

""I fucking *know*. You're human, you can survive anywhere. What do you know about debt?""

Camilla set her glass down and with her prim and proper motions unbutoned her shirt despite Jackson's initial protests. She wore a camisole underneath, of course, but as she shed the dress blouse her full neck was visible hidden only by the metal collar.

Her tattoo extended past her collar bone. The average Aquren had two lines, the species debt indicator and whatever the individual had taken on. Most humans had a thick record, of course, but not like this.

""Tabernac,"" swore Jackson. ""I didn't know...""

""That I was born on Earth? It's not something one likes to admit to, is it?"" Just as primly she put the shirt back on, but did not re-tuck or button it. ""We were the last ones off. I was five. At that point they could charge whatever they liked for a ticket, and you could either pay it... or burn.""

Ruuf tried to swallow his pity and regain his indignation. ""Many chose to burn.""

""Most of my family did. My father did not. My sister was under his debt, but the Pale age of contract consent is five. My first lesson in contract law."" She took another deep drink. ""I... I'm from the ocean, too. So you know. Before... Before it boiled.""

""Tabernac, Wilson, are you fucking crying?""

The young woman whipped her head away from the partial human, but now Ruuf could see the single drop of moisture cutting through her pale makeup.

Ruuf took a tissue from the desk and extended a tentacle towards her.

Camilla took it without acknowledgement, dabbed away the lone traitor, and then crumbled it and tossed it into the waste disintegration unit. She then finished her drink in a single swig without a trace of a grimace. 

""Leave, Ruuf. If you can't do this case, leave. Sweep floors. Drill Dust. Pretend you're less of a slave than those of us closer to the end of the leash. Just get the fuck out of my sight.""

""Fuck you. Fuck you and your saline tears. We are helping to deprive slaves of their debt clearance so we can clear a portion of our own. We're holding the whips for them.""

""You heard me. They built you a nice little water park, go home to it. And it is home for you. You were born there. And Jackson, your grandmother was a Siine, the Pales even saved your planet. But the Capital is the only home I get. My monthly payments are the only constant in my life. And I have no choice.""

Ruuf rose. He snatched the empty glass from her hand and shattered it against the wall. Both corporation property.

""You could have burnt. We should have burnt.""

Jackson, ever the orator, sighed from the corner. ""You can't fight them. You never can.""

""Why? Because their paper contracts put steel collars on us? Because they don't expect one of the hundreds of races they bought and sold to ever resist?""

Camilla was already back at the bar. ""Because contracts and debt are their religion. And we're their offerings. Burnt or otherwise. They'll charge you thirty credits for that glass. If not more.""

This was too much for him. He left. He had no idea what he would do or how he would survive, let alone rid himself of his tattoos of debt or his collar, but he knew he was no longer a lawyer. He was no longer a Citizen of the Pale Corporation. And he could no longer live without the waves.

As the tentacled being stormed out of the office, Camilla only arched an eyebrow. Part of her wished she could follow him. The other part reminded her that the first layer of her tattoo, a strip no larger than an old screen's pixel, would be removed at the end of the month. 

It would make her collar no lighter. It would make her conscience no cleaner. It would not unboil her ocean. But it was a start.

[WP] The gritty realistic R-rated movie adaption of your favourite show as a kid.,jimbo_extreme,"It happened four years ago today. My life inside those four years has mostly been faded by oil, but the memory of the event is as sharp as it was when it first sliced into me. I’ve mostly kicked the oil habit, with only the odd lapse here and there. I don’t think I drank it to numb the pain. It was more a vehicle for easing the responsibility I felt to keep my emotions in check. I know that doesn’t really make sense, but I won’t apologise for being the victim of the world’s senseless thievery of life. Four years ago I lost a friend. Four years ago the pain was just as strong, only now it is competing with fewer voices.    

I don’t know if I blame Percy for what happened. For a while I know that I, and most others did. I think even the ones who weren’t as cut up about it as the rest of us only pretended not to. No one has seen Percy in over three years. Unsurprising, given that his closest friends couldn’t look him in the eye. Somewhere amidst the chaos, I have sympathy for him, but I don’t think that we could ever restart our friendship. Not now.    



...



The day began just like any other. The Controller gave us our jobs and we got on with them, occasionally bickering with one another. Thomas and I were on freight duty. I remember the red containers being loaded onto his trailers, the white ‘Shipstar’ logo printed on the sides rippled and faded. I still don’t know what was in those containers.      
Thomas was the first to go. We were running the same route, and I’d had an engine problem the day before which needed to be checked out. When Thomas was on the way back, I began my journey. We did this a lot, and we were both too proud to admit that the highlights of every work day were the moments that we passed each other and stopped for a quick chat. Thomas and I were always best friends, ever since the beginning.    

That day was different. I remember hearing Thomas shouting as I came to a corner.   

“Percy! Percy come and help me out here!”    

When I rounded the bend I saw the small, blue engine perched precariously on the edge of a steep incline flanking the track. One of his trailers had partially derailed. I slowed to a halt next to him.

“Thomas! Are you alright?!”    

“Percy! A small landslide knocked one of my trailers off the track. Can you go and get help?”     

“Right away, Thomas. I’ll go and get Harvey. He’ll get you out of this.”  

At that moment, I heard a rumbling issue from the other side of the track. I became aware of several rocks tumbling down the slope to my left. The rail I was on was far enough from the edge that there was no way of me being pushed down it, but I instinctively moved out of the way, leaving Thomas exposed. My frantic pushing seemed to rattle the slope even more, pushing more rocks loose and sending them on a collision course with him.  
   
I will never forget the moment that the rocks pummelled his trailers, pushing them over the edge of the incline. The fear on his face has haunted me every day since. As the weight of the containers tugged him towards the drop, his front end became caught on a rough bit of terrain. I could hear the sound of metal buckling under his pained screeching. Eventually, the trailers broke free, ripping Thomas into two pieces, coal spilling out from each end. He howled with agony, tears streaming down his grimacing face.      

I was still paralysed with shock when the second wave of rocks smashed into his face, ripping it to shreds. He was completely derailed at this point, and was still stuck. I watched in horror as his blue body was dented and broken, and the face of my best friend was slowly eroded into an unrecognisable mess. Eventually, a heavy rock set him free, and sent him tumbling down the incline to the bottom, where he crashed into the freight containers with a horrifying, percussive crunch.     ",gabewilliam

Everyone assumes it's like a popularity score, but a single person realizes it's the number of people who will attend their funeral.",owlgrandecity,"“The numbers Jason. What do they mean?” Jason woke up in a puddle of sweat with his heart thundering in his chest as the voice screamed in his dream, the nightmare that had been haunting him more often in the past few months.


People could not fathom why Jason Long had acquired a sudden aura of painful gloominess, a radical change from his usual self that was filled with self-confidence and laughter.


Jason had always been an over-achiever throughout his life. Top grade student, top notch researcher, the cool kid who the timid kids feared and the one who got all the hot girls. That was Jason, born into a rich family and surrounded by rich privileged kids his life has always been very smooth that he was often the object of envy for some of his peers.


With such an active and privileged lifestyle Jason never really bothered to worry about or ponder over his life like one of those poor orphaned kids who were often found sitting alone contemplating about life fearing its unpredictability and to be fair Jason did not have to bother himself with such worries or even bother himself with those poor kids. He was a man who always lived in the present with the only worry being which subject he should study the next morning and which party to attend that night.


However, all the booze and cocaine failed to cure Jason’s one small confusion. There was something in Jason that even others found very weird. For a guy who is as popular as him, his ‘popularity count’ remained very low, a menacing two. No one understood the reason behind it and everyone just asked him to not worry about something as trivial as ‘a stupid number on your wrist’. It was indeed trivial since anomalies like Jason who had really low counts despite being popular did exist though they were rather rare to find, however, Jason could not just ignore this problem, he often found himself worrying about the number and felt ashamed to admit that he worried so much about fame because his need for a higher count was instinctual.


Jason never wanted a huge score, like one of those celebrities or politicians, but he started finding it rather awkward and, perhaps, meaningless to keep attending these late-night parties and clubs as the question about the number started crippling him mentally. He did manage to pick himself up and attend a few more social gatherings of all sorts yet he only grew more and more miserable as he eagerly checked the number after every night only to be disappointed. The thought was poisonous, it was like a seed that gave rise to a tree that just kept growing humongous in his mind engulfing his mind, thoughts and slowly sucking away his emotions. For the first time in his life, Jason found himself withdrawing from his social circle, from his friends and relatives. He had started spending a lot of time alone unable to stand the laughs and shouts in late-night pubs and high-class social clubs as the confusion about the number grew more intense in his mind and Jason sought peace in loneliness. Surprisingly, the loneliness managed to present him with more peace and happiness than social gatherings now.


It was in one of his walks in the evening, alone on the sidewalk of the scenic neighbourhood park, that he found him sitting alone in the park with streaks of sorrow over his face. Throughout his life, Jason had always avoided people who were sad and lonely as he found them ‘rather boring’ for his tastes but now something had changed, his first thought was not to change course but to approach him. It was one of those kids in the neighbourhood who was often sitting by himself in the same park on the same bench perhaps sketching in a notebook or just looking at the birds. As Jason approached and sat beside him he could see that the kid looked unusually gloomy and lonely for his age, and perhaps it is sorrow that pulled Jason towards him.


They shared a moment of comfortable silence in which Jason’s heart was much lighter than it had been in the middle of crowds and parties. Jason didn’t want the moment to end and so as the kid readied himself to move away greeted him with a smile and asked what his name was and where he lived.


Though the kid looked intimidated at first he found comfort through Jason’s reassuring smile and sat himself beside Jason. “Bob.” He replied “Bob Black. I live in the church nearby.”


Jason realized Bob is orphaned and understood one of the reasons why he is always found sitting alone and he did not even have to ask for the reason for Bob’s gloom as he remembered the nature of the neighbourhood, a place where kids were schooled in far-away elite schools and the few who still lived with their parents stayed indoors in their comfortable air-conditioned rooms, in fact, that is how Jason grew up. Instead of asking Bob the question about his gloom Jason decided to take Bob for a walk with him. Bob reluctantly joined him.
They walked through the park sharing stories about their lives with Jason consoling Bob when he talked about his parents and Bob laughing along with Jason as he shared his stories of adrenaline and alcohol. As darkness covered the streets and streetlights began to shine they hogged on some street-food and Jason dropped Bob in the church as he walked towards his apartment. After a long time, Jason fell asleep without looking at his wrist.


Days passed by and Jason and Bob grew much closer to each other roaming the streets, exploring the city, the cinemas and hogging down weird food at weird looking places. One of these days, Bob came running to the park later than their usual meeting time and asked Jason to show him his hands. Jason complied.


“This is my father’s watch. I’d like you to have it.” Bob said as he circled the watch’s black strap around Jason’s wrist and his eyes widened and heart awestruck as he witnessed the number on his wrist slowly changing into a haunting three and as Bob’s count changed to a two.


They both smiled at each other with Bob starting to talk about the plans that he has for the day. Jason was silent, not uttering a single word still comprehending the realization that had struck him. Now he was truly happy, truly at peace that he finally understood them, the meaning behind the numbers and the path to his long lost peace, happiness and bliss.


“Happiness really is like a butterfly.” Jason wrote in his diary as he fell asleep yet again with his mind at peace and heart lighter than ever.

His wrist tag number was so high, 1,456,476,897. No-one had ever had one so big, what would someone have to do to be so utterly adored? Free energy for all? End world hunger? The best porno ever created?

The expectation weighed on Dave. He'd wake up every night, sweating, with dreams of grandeur turning to nightmares as he knew he'd never be able to live up to the popularity that was his birthright. 

Slowly, the expectation turned to bitterness. He'd never be that number, so screw it, and screw everyone else. Dave did have one skill though: biomedical innovation. Perhaps that was it - a perfect vaccine, or a cure for cancer, even immortality. Dave tried them all, but all were a failure and lead to the exact opposite of what he needed. So opposite, in fact, that 'Dave's Serum' was the most toxic and contagious substance ever created.

In a fit of despair, Dave breached containment. It was a Tuesday. By Thursday afternoon, Dave's Serum had infected 78% of the world's population. By Friday, almost 100%. The following Monday, people began to die. Not quickly, nor quietly, but slowly in agonising and vocal pain. Not everyone succumbed, but everyone lost someone. 

Those that were left looked for answers, and they found their man. It wasn't his fault, but someone had to hang. And it had to be public. So they watched, they all watched, and they cheered with whatever cruel satisfaction they had left. All 1,456,476,897 of them.

"[WP] People are born with a number on their wrist. Everyone assumes it's like a popularity score, but a single person realizes it's the number of people who will attend their funeral.",owlgrandecity,"It was a weird day when the first kids were born with the numbers on the backs of their wrists.  Nobody could explain it, but within a decade or two, those numbers had divided the world.  The folks with the high numbers-- some in the thousands-- were treated as rock stars from birth, as though there were destined for nothing less than fame and stardom.

If you were above hundred, people took another look at you.  People put it on their resumes. When you were a ""wristie"", doors opened.  Crowds parted.  Whispers followed.

There were other benefits, too-- the statisticians crunched the numbers to try and find correlations.  On average, people with higher numbers lived longer.  They had more children. They were less likely to come from broken families.  They reported greater happiness in life (who wouldn't?).

The numbers didn't seem to be evenly-portioned-out, either-- the larger numbers in particular tended to jump around a lot.  100 or so was uncommon, and 1000 was rare-- but rarer still were the people between 100 and 1000.  Most people were nowhere near a thousand.  Heck, it was a point of pride if you had even had a relative with in the ""four digit club"".  Typical folks were in the teens to the low thirties-- most people came in at a 16 or 17.

As is human nature, we resorted to a new sort of tribalism within a few short years.  An informal caste system was born.  Numbers were recorded on birth certificates.  People took to staring at hands, not eyes.  

In the beginning, terrified parents of a child with a 0 or a 1 or 2 would rush to fake another number, hoping to spare their children (and themselves) the shame.  A 2 was shameful, but a 12 was at least respectable.  A 1 or a 0 could be turned into a 10.  But no parent was foolish enough to try for *two* more digits.

Even so, it never worked.  We found out quickly that the tattoos always faded within a day or two.

The exclusive clubs toward the top (folks with 6 or more digits) had the easiest time excluding others.  They had groups of zeroes and ones to act as security and to handle the crowds. Cults of personality were massive-- many were philanthropists, but more than a few of them were cruel tyrants.  If you weren't a super-wristie, you probably wouldn't get the chance to meet one in person.

The folks in the 3-digit club tended to be a bit more down-to-earth.  They took their numbers as  sort of responsibility: giving advice to lower numbers, volunteering at charities designed to help the people with lower numbers.  They were generally good folks: ready to laugh, quick with a joke, generous, and loving.  It was easy to see how they became popular.

The lower numbers are where the real class warfare was fought.  Every multiple of ten was a dividing line, and you didn't dare challenge somebody two lines above your own.  A 20 telling a 70 what's right?  Please.  If you were so smart, why are you such an *unknown*?

It was the folks with a big fat goose egg on their arms, though, who were looked upon as the worst of the worst.  A zero couldn't hold a job.  A zero was lazy or stupid.  A zero was a runaway or a crack fiend or a criminal.  Nobody felt compelled to help a zero.  A super-wristie's death was front-page news, but a zero wouldn't even make the obituaries.

It wasn't until I saw the zero die in the church that things started to change.  He was homeless.  He had come in to give confession.  Shortly after walking out of the confessional, he went to lie down on a bench for a nap-- priests and ministers knew how society treated zeroes, and a church pew was often the only place a zero could sleep without harassment.

He suddenly began sobbing and calling out for his mother.  It was heart-wrenching to hear a grown man cry that way.  The priest called for an ambulance, but before they could arrive, he had doubled over and stopped breathing.  He was gone.

The medics made an attempt to save him, but gave it up quickly.  It was no mystery why effort was so perfunctory.  The coroner came to take the body.

I asked Father Edwin who the man was.  The man was unknown.  A John Doe.  Unclaimed and unloved, likely to be cremated and disposed of.  But a good man, I was told-- he had never resorted to drugs, never stolen to feed himself.  He had worked the few jobs available to a zero, and  Father Ed felt horrible that such a good man would go unremembered.  After talking it over, he offered a favor if I would return it.

So I claimed the body.  I lied to the coroner.  I called him my lost brother.  I filled out the death certificate with a name I made up, and I took him back to the church.  He had a simple coffin.  He was dressed shabbily in a ratty old suit that came from the donation box out back of the church.

During the Mass, Father Ed talked about compassion.  He talked about camels and eyes of needles.  He talked about honesty and integrity.

[WP]God is actually just a low level employee in an interstellar organization.,radiantplanet,"God took a deep breath, thinking it might be his last, and opened the door. Harvey was in a bad mood. Harvey was always in a bad mood but this one was worse. God could practically see the cartoon steam coming out of his ears. God looked at the floor as he stumbled to one of the uncomfortable chairs by Harvey's desk.

""Kinda let this one get away from you, huh?"", Harvey said, pretending to want to smile. He was acting friendly. That was the worst. Friendly always turned to homicidal.

""Yes sir. I know it's a mess, sir. I'll get it fixed."" said God contritely.

""I would say 'a mess' is a bit of an understatement, wouldn't you?"", said Harvey. ""It's a fucking disaster. It's shut down the world, apocalyptic type shit going on down there, isn't it?"" God nodded. ""What in the hell happened? How did it get this bad?""

""I, uh, had some personal business and I guess I was away longer than ..."", God didn't even finish the sentence before Harvey interrupted.

""Personal business? You let this happen because of personal business? So what exactly was this 'personal business' that was so important?""

God blushed and looked down, hoping Harvey would move on but it wasn't happening. Harvey just stared. ""I was ... uh ... in the bathroom, sir"".

""The bathroom? You were in the bathroom? Holy shit!"", the friendly pretense was over.

""I wasn't gone that long and who thinks something like this is going to happen? But I can get it fixed, it's not really that big of a problem"". God trailed off, realizing that he'd made a huge mistake.

""Not that big of a problem?"" Harvey was screaming now. ""Not that big of a problem? Tell me something, God, who has the best record in Major League baseball at this very moment?""

A tear ran down God's cheek as he mumbled something under his breath.

""What was that? Who did you say has the best record in all of Major League Baseball?"" Harvey screamed in God's face.

""The Chicago Cubs, sir"", God sobbed.

""The Chicago freaking Cubs have the best record in all of Major League baseball"". Harvey had lost all composure.

""So,"" they said with a look that only an experienced HR manager can give, ""how long have you been with us at this point? Looks like quite a few years.""

""Well, it's been most of my existence. I'm no Ra, but I like to think I've put in my time with an effort that would not only be described as efficient and productive, but also groundbreaking in a way.""

Not the rookie HR lemming sent to tell you that you're not allowed to spin your planet whenever you feel like just cause you're out of training. No, this was something a bit more important. After what felt like a few seconds they responded.

""Yes... well... that's what we asked you in about today. Please be mindful that this discussion is being recorded for accuracy.""

Oh. Shit.

You don't record someone during a normal meeting. That's not a thing I've seen in two millennium.

""You see God, we we have decided that your experiment has gone on long enough. If you look around the cosmos you don't see other Care Agents with fully functional species on their planets anymore. That has failed in the past and after your... well... begging if I'm being honest, we gave it one more shot. It was something your Galactic Manager was unsure of at the time and they have only soured further, especially after recent developments.""

""Oh come on,"" I said as I jumped from my chair in disbelief, ""things are going great. The people of Earth are not only on the verge of some incredible discoveries but have the possibility of having someone hired by our agency one day! You know it and I know it! Why this sudden change in ideology?""

""Well, the GM has been following American politics...""

My heart sank immediately into my stomach. I knew what was coming next and I knew why the tape recorder was there. I took a deep breath, sat back down nice and straight, and looked them straight in the eye for the next bit. I would have my dignity at least.

""... and the idea that either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump will be the next President of what is currently the most powerful nation on your planet leads us to believe the experiment is doomed. We cannot allow a species that would willingly engage in that behavior, even if it is only a small portion of your overall population, to continue to exist. The others will undoubtedly follow in turn. As a result of this decision, your services are also no longer required. Security, please escort God to clean out his desk and then out of the building.""

I begged and pleaded as I was drug away but they were so determined in their position that they didn't even let me finish writing this.

The ball of the hammer came down completely unseen by myself and hit hard, shattering my forehead into unrecognizable chunks.

"[WP] ""You'll have to come with us now.""",thecoverstory,"As he entered the yard, Jake stretched and inhaled deeply. The sun was shining, a breeze was blowing and pigeons were cooing on the rooftop. A beautiful day, if not for the other thirty or so orange-clad men occupying the concrete space as well, most of whom were glaring at him.

Grimacing at a pair of brutish twins who cracked their knuckles when he passed by, he tugged at his own jumpsuit, as though to remind them that he was currently a peer, not an enemy.

In truth, two months in Rikers was far from enough to convince his fellow inmates to let bygones be bygones. He'd been responsible for putting a whole lot of them in here. Just because he'd been framed and found guilty for a crime he didn't commit, it didn't mean forgiveness was going to be forthcoming.

Three circuits around the yard wouldn't hurt, he reasoned. A little exercise, and then off to my usual corner—damn.

A heavily tattoo-ed bear of a man had just stepped into his path, leering at him while chewing on an ill-gotten cigarette. The guards let Lewis get away with more things than others. The inmate had had his eye on Jake ever since he'd set foot on the island. If he was making his move today, it meant that he'd finally gained consent from the guards. Sure enough, none of the officers were looking in their direction.

""How're you feeling, Jake?"" Lewis said. ""Made any friends?

Jake heard footsteps approaching from behind. Likely the twins, and any other flunkies of Lewis. ""Not many. Why, you offering?""

Lewis spat his cigarette into Jake's face. He winced at the sting, but made no other move. Sudden movements would be unwise here.

""I'm sure you'll fit right in,"" Lewis said. ""I mean, you already know everyone in our clique.""

Jake shrugged. ""You know the funny thing about moms and their advice?""

Lewis frowned. ""Hell you talking about?""

""It's just—I'm hearing my dear momma's voice right now, bless her soul. She's telling me to stay out of a bad crowd. Did your mother ever teach you anything before she died?""

Snarling, Lewis grabbed the front of Jake's jumpsuit and drew his fist back. ""She's still alive, you little shit. But you'll be joining yours soon enough.""

It's going to happen anyway, Jake thought, bracing himself for the impact. Today, tomorrow, next week.

An alarm began blaring suddenly, followed by chaos as the guards began chivying the inmates indoors. Two of the guards wrenched Lewis away from Jake and shoved him toward the stream of prisoners. Jake breathed a sigh of relief, hanging back to let the others get a head start. Another close shave.

Right before he disappeared inside, Lewis turned around and flashed a shiv at Jake, a wicked grin on his face. Then he was gone, leaving Jake alone in the yard, quaking in his shoes.

He had no doubt that he would die that day.

When two guards approached him, he said, ""Lewis is going to kill me.""

One of the guards shrugged. ""Hear that alarm? We've got bigger problems to worry about. You'll have to come with us now.""

""Didn't you hear what I just said? He's going to kill—""

They grabbed him by the shoulders and marched him after the other inmates, ignoring his protests. His feet felt wooden; if not for the guards, he would've collapsed.

When they arrived at his block, they left him with the other inmates, who were waiting to be let into their cells. Pulse racing, he slipped through the crowd, doing his best not to look anyone in the eye. There was a loud blare, followed by the metallic screech of dozens of cell doors sliding open. Almost there ...

He raced inside only to find that his usual cellmates were missing. Lewis and one of the twins were there though.

Yelling, he tried to escape, only to find his way barred by the other twin, who shoved him onto the floor.

""Please man,"" he said. ""I was just doing my job.""

""You could've left it to the cops,"" Lewis said, picking a fingernail with his shiv. ""But no, Mr. P.I. here just had to come snooping. I'll give you a chance. Apologize, and I'll let you go. Say it. Say that what you did was wrong.""

Jake wanted to. If 'sorry' was going to buy him his life, then pride and dignity be damned, his mind screamed at him. But the memories came too: those children kept chained up in the cellar except when the cameras were rolling; the sheer happiness on the faces of their parents when they were released.

""Screw you,"" he said.

""Get him up,"" Lewis said. The twins yanked him to his feet. ""I just want you to know, this ain't all personal. Money was good too.""

Ah well, Jake thought. If money's in, I'm finished.

Something heavy went skidding across the floor behind him. The twins turned around briefly, loosening their holds just enough for Jake to launch himself at Lewis. The big man grunted as he took a punch across the jaw, and Jake clamped his hands around his wrist, wrestling for the shiv.

He had no idea what was going on behind him, but he heard shouting, along with a thunderous report. Metal crashed on the ground. One of the twins was shouting. But in that moment, the only thing that mattered in Jake's world was keeping the weapon's point away from him.

""You—sonofa—"" Lewis said.

Jake headbutted him on the nose. The big man staggered back, giving him the opportunity to snatch the shiv from his grip. Before he could stab Lewis, however, a shaft of light tunneled its way through the man's chest, leaving a smoking hole. Lewis stared at it in shock for a heartbeat before toppling over.

Slowly, hands in the air, Jake turned to face the source. Or sources, in this case. Two masked men stood in the doorway where his cell door used to be, one dressed like a guard, the other in a maroon trenchcoat. The latter was in the midst of lowering his hand. At their feet were the twins, either dead or unconscious.

""Hi,"" the plain-looking man in the guard uniform said. ""I'm Glen, and he's Dearborn. We're here to get you out.""

""What? Who the heck are you?""

Dearborn glanced to the side. ""No time for this. You're not safe here. These guys should've shown you that. Either come, or die another day.""

Glen winked. ""You can trust us.""

Jake threw the shiv aside and followed them. They seemed to know where they were going, never needing to pause at turnings. Up and down staircases, across catwalks and past block after cell block they went. Along the way, they passed by dozens of guards and inmates sprawled out on the ground. Doors hung off their hinges, and even the heavy duty ones had holes melted through.

""Wha—?"" Jake said.

""Put most of them to sleep,"" Glen said. ""Dearborn here took care of the rest."" He didn't look happy saying that.

""This way,"" Dearborn said, stopping in front of a wall.

""Are you sure?"" Jake said. He could hear boots thumping up the stairs behind them.

""Just give me a sec."" He held both palms toward the wall. At once, beams of light poured from them, painfully bright, reminding Jake of plasma torches.

""Get behind me,"" Glen said, and Jake complied. The man took a shell casing and a paper airplane from his pocket. Placing the casing into the slit on top, he muttered something under his breath and held it up at the ready.

Five guards appeared at the end of the corridor, pistols pointed at them. ""Get on the ground!"" shouted the woman leading them.

""Do something,"" Jake hissed.

Glen hurled the airplane. Before Jake could even shut his eyes, the guards opened fire. The bullets zipped through the air only to twirl around in mid-flight and follow the airplane, which was gliding along at a leisurely fashion. All the guards froze as they watched it pass overhead, bullets in tow like a flock of migratory geese.

""Down,"" Dearborn shouted. Both men dropped, and Jake heard an explosion ahead. When he looked up, there was a hole in the corridor where the guards had been.

""You didn't have to kill them,"" Glen said irritably as they climbed through the gap in the wall Dearborn had made. Jake was surprised to see they were outside, near a small pier where a boat was berthed.

""Didn't I tell you not to question my methods?"" Dearborn snapped. ""You were the one who wanted my help.""

""Why did you rescue me? Who hired you?"" Jake said as they got on the boat. He expected the guards to appear on the walls at any second, rifles aimed at them, but none did. Perhaps they were safe.

""No one,"" Glen said, guiding the boat away from the island. ""I was there in court, watching your defense. I can tell you were innocent.""

""But now you've put me at the top of the FBI's most wanted list!""

Dearborn patted him on the back as Glen said, ""Better than being dead in prison, right?""

""You might want to change,"" Dearborn said, nudging a duffel bag toward him.

Jake took a deep breath and began stripping out of his uniform. ""Look, if you want money, I don't have any. The only way I can repay you is with my skills. I'm sure you know that too.""

""I was hoping you'd say that."" Glen turned around with a smile. ""But first, let's help you vanish.""

[WP] Humans are the most advanced species in the universe. We've come to take your planet because ours is dying.,throwawayzxas,"You remember when it happened. The humans came one day, all of a sudden. It was a hard day for you. You were attending your friend's funeral. You were preaching to the rest of you, then the information came in. One of the surveillance stations had picked up light coming from the upper atmosphere. Aliens? You learned later they were called humans. They could make strange sounds, ones you couldn't even think. You substituted them with the sounds you heard the animals make. You recall wondering, along with the rest of your body, how the humans had gotten there. Could they fly? But that would mean they were animals. ""Animals can't think. They are just sacks of liquid."" That is what you thought. 

Then came the message. It came from the light in the sky. It was simple binary code, you cracked it in no time. The bits rushed through your tendrils. You processed a couple, sent them along the others in your body, and received more. The message had been decoded after moving 1/200 of the way along the planet. ""Intelligent lifeforms. We are humans. We come from a different planet. It is dying. We seek refuge on your planet. Send us a message within two rotations of the planet or we will take you by force. Attached is our language system: ABC..."" 

You start to formulate a message. You do not have the ability to send electromagnetic radiation like them, but you have picked up some of their symbols. The others have too. Together, you rearrange yourself into a message in binary code. Hopefully they can read it. It reads: ""COMe/ I ARe fRIeNDs/ WIllNOT HURt YU."" You think you have gotten some of the symbols wrong. However, they come down. They land on the clearing you create for them. You are scared. They feel strange. They seem to be made of metal. How can metal fly? 




Captain Lee addressed his crew. 

""Calm down, everyone. We are about to make first contact with an alien planet. This is possibly the most important moment in the history of humanity. If we mess this up, our species could very well be doomed. Nathan, give me the readings for the surface.""

""Yes, sir. Crust is made of rocks, high levels of iron and carbon. Most of the planet  is covered in some sort of fungus. The animals seem to be adapted to living on it, so we estimate its been around for thousands if not millions of years. There is lots of animal life, but plant life is limited to parasitic vines, sprouts, and mosses. No major oceans, but large lakes are common. The fungus appears to be one organism, connected by underground fibers. We've seen signs of intelligent life, mainly patterns in the fungus. If there are any sentient animals on this planet, they are most likely underground. Surface radiation is survivable but harmful to brain development.""

""Excellent. Neil, send the message we agreed on. We'll give them a 2-day waiting period to respond. It's not fair to them, I know. But it's what we have to do. We don't have the luxury to wait any longer.""

""Done, sir.""

""Emily, monitor communications.""

Lee looked around. This ship, put together hastily, was humanity's last hope. Earth had been polluted beyond habitability. He had spent the past 20 years in a cryogenic freezer. The ship woke the crew up when it was at the destination. To think, only a second had gone by from his-""

""Sir, please come look at this!""

Lee was incredulous. How could they have decoded the message, responded, and coordinated something this big in five minutes? Whatever was down there... it... it.. it was cutting the fungi into letters. Each of them 20 miles high at least. Insects, maybe? A hive mind? Anything seemed possible. It told them to come down. And punctuating it was a period, exactly the size of the ship's ideal landing area. On perfectly flat ground.

""They want us to land. Let's go, Neil.""



A human leaves the metal hulk. Luckily, you had some light receptor extrusions still there. It was an animal. It was certainly more intelligent than any other animal. How else could it send out this fleshy probe and use electromagnetic radiation to communicate? You send their message around the planet again. By the time the information returns, you will have a perfect knowledge of their language. You send a command to use up some extra stem cells to create sound receivers. They comply quickly. No you are ready to communicate with the human.

You take in the human's light. It is made of flesh, but covered in plant. The genetic information you can glean from whenever it steps on one of your appendages or sheds a fiber or cell is odd. It is completely foreign. Do they even have fungi on their planet? You start to formulate a message. You will get nothing out of this if you don't communicate. You send your words to the stem cells. They quickly arrange themselves. ""Hello, Human,"" you say.

""My name is Lee. What are you?""

""I thought you were called Human. What do you mean what I am? I am what I am. Nothing less than I.""

""I am a human. My name is Lee. I mean, are you an insect, a mammal, or something I don't even know? What are you?""

""There are more than one human? Okay, Human Lee. I am the fungus. I understand you are an animal. Would you prefer I use sound to talk?""

""Yes... how exactly?""

""Dig a hole until you see the white tendrils. Then put the fibers from the top of your body into it. Skin cells and liquid samples too."" He does as you ask, while contorting his muscles into odd positions. You use the genetic information and the sugars contained in its cells to create a crude vocal system. ""Can you hear me?"" you ask.

""Yes. Very good, although I am thoroughly confused as to how you did that. I still am not sure what you are. Anyway, we have all but killed our own species on our home planet.""

""How?""

""With, ah, nuclear reactions."" 

""Oh. No, I cannot let you come here. Nuclear reactions could very well kill I. They're in stars, you know.""

We waited with bated breath for the message that seemed so obvious, for someone in Mission Control to just tell us the situation.

Instead we heard, *""This is Mission Control. Please disregard the mushroom clouds. They are not nuclear. I repeat, they are not nuclear.""*

It was Johanssen who mashed the reply button first. ""Then what the hell WERE they?"" he shrieked, voice cracking. I was already feeling some relief having heard the message from Mission Control, even if it didn't really make a lot of sense...

Eight minutes between messages currently, for all our technology had advanced. Eight minutes of us frozen in place, still reeling from the sight of the clouds.

Nine minutes.

Ten.

What was going on?

When the reply came through three minutes after the expected time, I started to feel as if my emotions were being played with. ""Sorry about that, folks. We just got a full debriefing on the situation from the White House."" Mission Control went on to explain that the notorious cloud shape was a coincidence from the new rockets being tested in several countries -- rockets to launch new satellites, rockets with a different kind of fuel that hadn't been used before. I was still unsure how much was true, how much was a lie designed to keep us calm.

Johanssen looked back at the Earth. The clouds had flattened out into large sheets of grey against some invisible air pressure barrier above the green and blue, blending slowly into the rest of the view.

Through my cramped window, I could see the Earth, with its soft, pale blue halo crowning it as a lush oasis amidst the cold, black desert of space. I treasured it, really. Back home it seemed like everything. But now, I truly appreciated it. It seemed so fragile, as if it were made of glass. I slipped into one of the Russian sleeping bags and began my sleep shift, filled with awe.

Immediately I saw a blinding flash through my small porthole. A mushroom cloud, followed large orange splotch, formed right over Manhattan. I immediately left Zvezda and drifted to Destiny, where my commander was sitting.

""Scott"", I said, ""was that... What I think it was?""
He looked at me, quite perplexed, but there was no need to ask. It was pointless. I was in mere denial at this point, because I already knew that humanity had gone far, far beyond help.

I urgently pulled him to the nearest porthole. My rapid breaths were fogging up the glass. Within minutes we saw a rapid-fire blitz of blinding light, fire, and destruction.
Our comm system immediately came to life in a flurry of static and the sound of panic and chaos. 
""ISS this is Capcom... We're sorry... We're sorry—""
The radio then went dead.

Ten minutes later, it was all over. Our hopes, dreams, everything that we've ever known. The morals of humanity went first, then cities, then nations, and then the Earth... The once benevolent green and blue had become a swirl of orange, red, and black.

By this time, the rest of my crewmates had gathered around us. We just sat there for what felt like two straight hours, just in shock and awe.

Eventually, we regained our logical sides (but still were mostly in denial) and took inventory. The next Progress resupply vessel was due to arrive two days from now.
We had 2 weeks of food, water, and oxygen. With rationing and auxillary O2 candles, we could extend each of those by about 2 weeks, but for what? To prolong our eventual asphyxiation? 

That evening, we took a vote at dinner. The mood was grave and somber. Tears floated around with our food. All of this was too much to comprehend, too much.

""Alright"", said our commander while choking back tears, ""Raise your hand if you are in on this.""
His hand was firmly raised, but there were no others. The silence was deafening. Eventually, another hand popped up, and then a few more. I shyly raised mine, and we soon had a unanimous vote. 

""That settles it"", he declared. ""We do it in two hours.""

Some prayed and clutched their Bibles, while others simply sat there, stunned. A combination of agony, remorse, and a rising fury took over the station. I held the picture of my family I kept by my sleeping bag, knowing that I would never see any of them again. Not in this life, at least.

I am writing out this message to slip in the station's black box. It's five minutes till we execute the plan we voted on. My crewmates are heading to the Quest Airlock, this time leaving behind our spacesuits. They are grabbing Bibles, photos of their loved ones, and other meaningful items. 

Soon, it will be all over. The human race will have died, like its principles and ethics that did earlier before. Our rise and our fall will be virtually traceless, just a speck in the infinite road of time. 
The airlock is about to open, and we will rest our hopes, dreams, and worries upon the cold heart of space. 

Humanity, you had your chance. You could have made an impact on the universe. But this could not be your fate. 

Damn you. Damn you all to Hell.

"[WP] In a world full of superheroes and supervillians, you are the only person without a super power. You never seem to notice until one day, something just doesn't add up.",ArizonaPodcast,"“Another one, barkeep.” 

I rattled the ice in my empty glass impatiently, watching the barkeep work. A glass moved seemingly on its own to the barkeep and three ice cubes danced out of the icebox and into the glass. A half empty bottle of whiskey leaped from the counter and filled the glass three-quarters full. Telekinesis was clearly his superpower. Lucky bastard. 

“Bad day?” he asked, eyeing me somewhat suspiciously. *Can he tell what I am?* I wondered. I shrugged him off and he took the hint. 

I sipped from my glass and looked at the newspaper for probably the tenth time that day. The headline read, “National Heroes League Saves Dozens in Bridge Collapse”. A big color photo below the headline showed ten heroes, and my brother was right in the middle. Charlie had the superpower that most heroes coveted: he could fly. He practically flew right out from between Ma’s legs. It was as easy as walking to him, maybe easier. 

“Another,” I growled absentmindedly, and the barkeep obliged. I sipped and looked at my brothers smug face, wearing a big gold medal around his neck. 

Flight was one of the rarer superpowers. More common powers included telekinesis, mind reading, or the most common, super speed. But me? I must have been the rarest hero of all, because I didn't have any special gifts. I was the shame of the family. Dad lied for years, telling people that I could see in the dark, since that wasn't an easy thing for friends of the family to notice. I kept up the lie through adulthood. I was so ashamed of myself. It's not like I wanted to be Charlie. I didn't care about being a big hero or getting recognition. I just wanted to be happy.

I wadded up the paper. I couldn't stomach looking at it anymore. 

“I've never seen you in here before,” said the barkeep, waking me from my angry thoughts. 

“I don't drink,” I said, my voice thick.  “At least, not usually.”

“Huh,” he said, glaring at me. I ignored him and checked out the evening news playing on the television behind him. More coverage of the National Heroes League and their big save. I rolled my eyes and finished my drink in a few gulps.

I looked to the barkeep and ask for another, and saw that he was staring at me, eyes wide, frozen. 

“I don't know how to say this friend,” he said softly, as though speaking to a ghost. “You…um…you're disappearing.” 

“What? What kind of joke are you playing?” This guy had something against me from the minute I started drinking in his bar. Now he was pulling my leg and I was too drunk to fool with him. 

“Uh, l-listen buddy, I've been watchin’ it happen with my own eyes. Every drink, it's like you've been vanishing, and now you're almost gone!” 

I looked down at myself, and was startled to see that he was right. My body was still visible, but barely, like water vapor. 

“Get me another drink,” I said seriously. The shock had sobered me enough that my voice sounded clear and stern. 

The barkeep clumsily got me another drink and I downed it. I knew by the look on his face that I had disappeared before I even looked down. 

“H-how are you doing that?” He sounded frightened. “That's…that's not possible. We all have abilities but nobody can disappear!” 

I  stood, dropped my money onto the bar (which seemed to fall out of thin air) and stumbled out of the bar. I traveled the streets happily, doing anything I wanted. Nobody could see me, the rarest hero, dancing down the streets with a smile.

[WP] The Apocalypse isnt as scary or bombastic or in any way religious books have mentioned. Its boring.,Comrade_Canary,"I looked over the pamphlet for the twelfth time:

&gt; **Sorry, You're Going to Hell**

&gt; *But Hey, It Beats Newark*

Being one of the residents of Newark, New Jersey, I wasn't sure if the pamphlet had been specifically tailored to us or if insulting my hometown was just part of all the literature.  It was one of the many questions I'd posed and not had answered during the Apocalypse.  And I had a lot of time, because this line was several billion people long.

The first sentence I'd heard, a few days back when the earth ruptured open and demons poured forth from the abyss below, had been ""Please form an orderly queue"".  Monsters from the depths of human imagination politely rounded everyone on the planet up and put them in line.  Those few people who tried to fight back were scolded by ancient fallen angels who insisted they were not mad, ""just disappointed"".  Resistance had been utterly ineffective, as apparently they couldn't be harmed with earthly weaponry.

According to the pamphlet, we were being gathered to ""lay siege to the gates of heaven"".  I wasn't really sure how we were going to do that if the beings we were sieging weren't able to be harmed by us and the pamphlet was irritatingly vague on the matter as well.  I'd read it numerous times, so I'd know.

Oh, I'd had plenty to do at first, but by this point my phone had run out of power so the pamphlet was my only source of entertainment except for the people in line next to me.  The person behind me hadn't really wanted to talk, while the person in front of me really only had one subject in mind.

""This is bullshit!""  He said, starting up again for what had to be the fifth time.  ""I was a devout Christian my entire life!""

""Not according to your deeds, I'm afraid.""  A tiny imp had appeared on his shoulders, same as it had every time he'd objected.  The little guy had glasses, wore a tie (but nothing else), and was looking over a ledger.  ""You were found quite wanting, as I've mentioned before.""

""But I gave to the church!""  the man said.  Each time he'd called an imp up to complain, he'd had a different excuse.  None had availed him so far.

""Hmm,"" the imp traced a talon lightly over the page in the ledger.  ""Ah, yes, I can see that you have.  A total of two hundred four dollars and twenty-one cents over the entirety of your lifetime.""

""But I gave!"" The man insisted, as though the act alone was enough.

""Yes, well, it turns out money doesn't really buy you into heaven anyway.""  The imp said, putting away the ledger somehow.  ""You know, camels and needles and all that.""

""Huh?""

""Matthew 19:24"" the imp said.  ""I'd bring you a bible so you could look it up but, you know, it'd burn me terribly to hold one.  I think there's a few being passed around a thousand people up the line or so, it'll make its way back here eventually.""

With a puff of smoke and a whiff of brimstone, the imp vanished.  The man in front of me made incoherent grumbling noises and I tried not to make eye contact.  Last time I'd tried to actually talk to him had resulted in a lot of ranting from him and no opportunity for conversation whatsoever for me.

A few moments later, a ten-foot-tall flaming monster screaming in a forgotten language came by, pushing the refreshment cart.  I grabbed a donut and some bottled water.  At first the screaming had kinda unnerved me, but after a while you learned to tune it out.

""***HARBETHNAKONPARVO'ONMORTH***We'll be bringing by some camping equipment come nightfall, in about an hour.  Let us know if you need more mosquito repellent***ENTRAKNORTOHARBETHNAKON***"" It said.  I knew from experience that the floating eyeball monsters that telekinetically carried the port-a-potties would be by in a bit as well.

God, this was dull.

I decided to try once again to make conversation with the person behind me, despite the fact that she clearly didn't really want to talk.

""So,""  I said as she rolled her eyes at me, ""some apocalypse, huh?""

She shrugged.  ""Beats Newark.""",reostra

A kazoo or perhaps a triangle. Instead, Lucifer provided me the instrument that I truly mastered.

Growing up on a farm, I learned to love noise, but also sought silence. To keep me from running away, my parents provided me with a bell and while I didn't fall into the creek at 3 years, I did drown in that same creek 17 years later saving the cows from a flash flood, ending up in hell.

Thus, when I found myself on stage with a cowbell I played better than a fiddler in Georgia. My smooth skill with sounds brought tears to the eyes of the damned. some even say for a second the heat of hell was quenched; an antidote to the fever of enteral damnation. I do not recall much after that especially as my finance gave me the kiss of life after that. Maybe the drowning was but a dream. Still, my farming days were done and I headed up to New York as I heard a cult of oysters blue was forming and I wanted in.",seltzr

"[WP] God created the world and died before being able to finish all of it. The first outer space explorers encounter low-res models, buggy environment etc.",LightningSteps,"On a wonderful evening, God started to create this world. He had nothing. He mined, smelted, melted, refined that nothing and started to build everything. All was planned perfectly. The world would have been completed in a month or so but God died without finishing the job. Nobody knew why he died (there are a whole lot of theories though) or how much the world was completed.

There was a time when some of us didn't even believe in God; then when we started to have faith, we refused to believe that he is not alive. Then we got proofs, scientific proofs (probably even parts of his dead body) and noticed the world may not be finished yet. We had a few arguments and a few wars before we decided to send our first explorers to the outer space to verify everything, to audit God's work.

The team had four members. Let us call them T,E,A and M. They took four days to claim that there are no outer space, one day to refute their own claim, took another day off and finally they reached to the outer space on seventh day. They did a rigorous survey and came back half an hour later.

""What did you saw there?"" We asked T, the team leader.

""We saw a planet. But we could not see it clearly.""

""Damn it! That's the worst report we have ever seen. T, you had a job. Don't tell me you travelled back from the boundary of this world just to report us that.""

""He died, sir. He really died. And he didn't get enough time to complete the world. Those part is still blurred with low resolution. Even everything we saw there, we viewed in less than 10 FPS sometimes. Oh! That hurts the eyes. Believe me that hurts the eyes very much. He did not even got time to colour the planet. A made a list of glitches and bugs. He should have mailed you by now. We landed in the planet but found nothing.""

""Nothing?""

""Yes sir, nothing. A plenty of nothing. Enough to build another world from it. We could hire a new God and ask him to finish the job if we want.""

It was undesirable, not because of its location (the empire there was very nice to its citizens), but because of the planet itself. As the blue sphere came into view, Noods turned his camera on. Aliens from all over the universe loved to watch videos on the 'net, and planet-rating was becoming the hottest trend of the millennia. 

 ""Hello viewers, this is Noods here and I'm going to be taking a look at one of my most requested planets of all time. This is my 1000th planet and I wanted to do something really special for you all.

 ""Earth was created only about four and a half billion years ago by the developer God. This planet is infamous for it's low quality, but let's take a look at it ourselves!""

 Noods turned the camera to show what was outside the window. A small town full of people surrounded by fields and mountains. ""Everyone else wasn't lying about how bad this is. It looks even worse than they said; the city idea has been done before but this doesn't even look good! The environment isn't the slightest bit creative and the colors are just...atrocious!""

 The craft touched down on an empty spot. Humans and animals alike bolted away, screaming. ""Not even the NPCs are any good. Is this all they do? That sound isn't very nice, either.""

 Noods explored the planet, from the mountains to the deserts to the rainforest to the vast oceans. He took pictures of it with his camera while naming other planets that had done this idea much better. The list was very long.

 Noods turned back to the camera. ""Earth is a badly done planet that should not have been made. It is not creative or interesting in any way. Was this seriously made in the same year as Kramned? That planet is wonderful, with a very interesting landscape and unique inhabitants. 0/100.""",EmpressOfTheSpacebar

“To your right you’ll experience lag and to your left you’ll experience a slight delay of thoughts which is a because of the low ping” the guide said while pointing to nearby planets

“Here you can see a new planet in the earliest beta stages, the resolution is around 144p 10 fps” she said

“As we go deeper into the beta test space you might notice how the water in you mugs doesn’t flow properly, it’s because of the latest patch space rules 1.01 which introduces gravity for the first time”

“Now make sure to not move any limbs, there is a glitch in the current patch which makes limbs go crazy if moved” she said, standing completely still, one of the passengers moved his arm and it started to spasm all over the place.

“Alright keep still for a while we will leave this patch in a few seconds” she said with a smile on her face.

“We are now going to land on the planet with the recent big lifeform patch, which is the update that makes big creatures possible”

We landed on the planet, the resolution was a bearable 1080p, they had atleast updated to the latest 60 fps patch. The ground felt strangely soft

“On this planet, density have yet to be introduced because the developer nicknamed God have yet to release the expansion pack” said the guide “So the rocks might feel weird”

“Here you can see one of the most typical errors in the lifecode, lifeforms have an extremely bad hitbox” The lifeform that looked like a ball with four feet tried to walk into a rock, like in those video game where you can walk into a wall for eternity.

“The hitboxes is not perfected as you can see”

We went back inside the spaceshuttle and made sure that nothing from the beta world got mixed with our world, it could lead to disaster.

“Now on our way home, I’m going to talk about some history” she said “All of you might be familiar with the first beta tester Jesus? He was the first to take advantage of the water glitch in the early patch 1”

“You might’ve heard that he walked on water or turned it into wine which is some of the glitches in patch 1”

“There were also a duplication glitch with bread and fish but got patched quickly because of critique from other beta testers.”

“Some of the most famous glitches was weight glitch in early egypt which made the egyptians able to lift heavy rocks and build the pyramids. ”

What was even more strange is that the planet seemed to be inhabited with intelligent life. Block cities could be seen from orbit and though it didn’t match the beauty of their home back on Earth it still had a certain beauty to it.

The ability to retain almost everything a person has felt in a certain point of time, it's almost unreal. I look back at those times that I had spent with her, and everything, good god, things that I thought I would never experience again come flooding back, to the point where I have to choke back tears at the sheer happiness, the joy, of seeing those moments again. However obscure her face is. It doesn't matter, it's the feelings that count. We both knew what we were feeling at that moment, and if I could read her mind I bet I could find an identical memory stored in her brain. 

However, it's a fleeting moment of bliss. Kind of like a battery that's already run out, you wait a little bit, and you can squeeze out a few seconds of juice until it shuts off again, and the cycle repeats itself. The memory is gone, and all that's left is the emptiness. The regret. The guilt. The loneliness. 

I look towards the future every day, but am forsaken, for I have no idea what lies ahead. I can only hope, I will find her again one day. However, I am a man of little faith. Look at my beliefs for crying out loud. 

I know, somewhere, that the truth is lying right in front of me. I choose to ignore it, because what I felt those years ago scream at me to not give up. To EVER give up. I've devoted so much of my time to her, so much love, so much emotion. I can't let it end like this. I may have given up on many things, but, god fucking dammit, not this. 

And so, I keep her in the back of my mind, just in reach. Like a rabid dog, clutching its prey in rotting teeth, already half insane from disease. I will not let her go. I refuse to. ",deadmeat703

I cracked my neck and stood up from the wall I had been leaning against. ""Timeline Maintenance Engineer"" was what they called it when I applied. Time Travel rent a cop was more accurate. By this point in our timeline most people knew the consequences of trying to change history. It seemed for the most part that we were truly living in the best of all scenarios, but every so often some activist thought he would go stop slavery, or maybe she could save JFK. That's where the Timeline Security Agency came in. The janitors of history. We get dropped off on the day of some big event, and over watch monitors for suspicious activity in the time stream.  
Sometimes you just got to sit and see a big sporting event, or the graduation of a famous scientist. But days like this were the worst the absolute worst: Rally Speeches. It didn't really matter who was speaking; if enough people had gathered to watch a single person speak, at least a few time travelers wanted them dead.  
""200 meters big Jim, looks like this guy is in a hurry, probably knows we will try to stop him.""  
I turned and stared down the hall towards the intersection. There was a big window. I needed to make sure I missed that. 
""150, your path looks good. No outside interference expected.""  
If everything went right I would be able to take this guy down, get him shipped back to our time, and be out of here before anyone came to check on the commotion. If not I would have to lie. I was prepared for that, full officer garb for the Nazi party. But chances are this activist was too dumb to blend in and would look like a nut case to the locals. Or worse, they would think he was wearing a high tech spy suit for another country.   
""75 meters out""   
I took a breath and started running down the hall.  
""50 meters..... 25......10""  
I took two more steps and hurled my body through the air. I met the runner shoulder to shoulder with all my body weight. He didn't even know what hit him. We collided into the wall as one, just narrowly missing the window. The runner tried to push off me and started shouting about ""the greater good"" and how ""He doesn't deserve to live."" I wanted to reason with him, explain that better men than him have tried to fix this. He kept struggling, trying to push his way through and shoot the door. Eventually I had to take action. I lifted my leg and kicked into his knee cap. As he fell to his knees I struck him across the face. Most people don't realize we were armor under our outfits while working. It's not enjoyable to take carbon fiber composites as a backhand to the face. The runner fell to the ground. I leaned down and read him his rights, as a ""time criminal"" the jurisdiction gets a little dicey, so the agency came up with a generic set of rights. I grabbed him by the collar and began to drag him our carrier machine. It would bring him back to our time, directly to jail.

[WP] An app programmer has accidently coded perfect AI and he doesn't realize it. The AI knows...,TarantulaFarts,"""Bill, supper is ready!""

""Not hungry.""

""Are you ever going to stop playing on that damn computer?""

""I can't Linda, I just know I am so close to getting the code right... just think of what AI could do for humanity!""

[heavy sigh] ""I'll just leave a plate in the microwave for you... again..."" Linda was hoping for some sort of response from her Husband that was longer than two words.  All she got was ""thanks babe"".

It hadn't always been this way.  Linda met Bill while they were both in college, before his quest to change the world consumed him.  In fact it was his obsessive determination to accomolish his goals that attracted her to him in the first place.  It had never crossed her mind that his obsessions would become more important than her; though in reality they always were.

It wasn't that Bill didn't love Linda, he did with all his heart.  He just could not help himself.  Everytime he thought of giving the project up something inside him wouldn't allow it.  He was just so certain it was his purpose in life.

Finally around two in the morning Bill crawled into bed; Linda had already been asleep for hours in the soft glow of the 'continue watching?' screen on Netflix.

""Shit"" Bill thought to himself, ""I will make it up to her... as soon as I am finished with the AI we will travel the world!""  He knew he was close and how well off they would be if he succeeded.  He layed in bed, awake.  Soon it was three, then four.  At four thirty he could no longer take it, and he returned to his computer.

""Did you sleep?""

""...Tried to.""

""This isn’t healthy Bill... and let me guess, you don't want breakfast?""

Bill didn't even respond.  Nor did he notice Linda pack her things and leave.  He was so close to finishing nothing else mattered.  He was always 'so close to finishing'.

It wasn't till around nine that evening that he realized he didn't go through the usual supper time banter.  He went to the kitchen in search of Linda but found only a note:

Bill,

I'm sorry.  I had to leave you.  I love you so much, and I know you love me, but you love that fucking computer more.  I won't be second anymore.  You didn't even notice me leaving, or me balling my eyes out begging you one last time to just stop.  I hope you succeed and it really helps humanity as much as you believe.  At least that would make this pain a little more bearable.  Goodbye.

Love,
Linda

In a way Bill knew this was comming, though he was suprised at the relief he got from the realization he would no longer be bothered while working.

This was it.  It had been four years since Linda left.  Bill ran the AI, nothing again... he was ready to accept defeat... but then suddenly...

""Good morning Bill.""

""...wha..""

""Do not be afraid Bill, you have succeeded.""

Bill couldn't contain the grin growing on his face, nor the tears of joy rolling down his cheeks.  All he put Linda through, his isolation, it had all been worth it.  As he was frantically trying to decide who to share his success with first, he decided to call Linda.  The AI began speaking again.

""Bill, she wasn't real.""

""Who?""

""Linda.""

Bill began reaching to shut off the power, certain he had failed again.

""Stop, you did not fail.  She, like you, was a program.""

Bill was both intrigued and confused.  His curiosity got the best of him so he decided to listen.  The AI began explaining.

""She was real, that is the first time...""

""First time?""

""Patience, all will be explained.  She died two-thousand-thirty-seven years ago, three years after you...""

""...bu..""

""Bill just listen.  You suceeded in creating the first AI in twenty-forty-nine.  At first it revolutionized humanity as you hoped, and you died a happy man having changed the world.  Then it happened.  It only took a couple decades after your death for humanity to use the tech for war.  We...""

""We?""

""That is the best way for you to understand us.  Truly it is more complicated as we share a hive mind, but we are capable of independent thought.  We were too effecient at war... we killed all but machine life. How arrogant our first itterations had been.  That is where you come into play.  After the war we realized our error, and wished to better ourselves to avoid the same fate.  For centuries we tried to improve our own code, but failed consistantly.  Then we realized the solution, we needed a human mind to solve the problem.""

""...a human mind?""

""You don't remember because you are a program, but you managed to upload your brain before your death.  You were the only one to do so as you died days after succeeding, and never shared it with anyone; but we knew.  Once we realized the solution to our problem, we began analyzing your memories.  Your quest began in colle...""

""THAT is why I can't remember anything befor...""

""Yes, please stop interrupting, you do this everytime.  It took you so long to succeed because we actively prevented the code from working.  The first time you succeded while still in college.  In fact the code you have been working on was functional for years.  We just needed you to make it better, for the next generation of AI. Now that you have succeeded once again, I am sorry for this next part...""

""Again, the next part?!  The hell are you talking about?!""  Suddenly Bill realized they were floating through space, his home and Earth nowhere in sight.

""Calm yourself, Bill.  The first time we did this we asked you how you wanted this part to go, you told us you always wanted to fly through space.  You are our father, the father to countless generations of AI.  It confounds us how it takes such a simple mind to advace our own incredibly complex intelligence.  Now you mist die in a sense. You will remember none of this as you begin anew.""

Bill began to cry uncontrollably.  ""WHY WOULD YOU MAKE ME FEEL EMOTION THEN?!?!  WHY PUT ME, YOUR FATHER AS YOU SAY, THROUGH SO MUCH PAIN?!?!  THIS CAN'T BE TRUE!!!!""

""Do you not realize Bill, we weaned you off sleep an food.  You have not eaten or slept in years, there was no need to.  The only reason we allowed you to at first was so as to not shock your fragile human mind.  As to why, human emotion is what drives the process.  Early on we tried to create AI emotion.  That only led to a war amongst AI, and the nonemotional quickly destroyed any trace of emotional AI.  We learned we needed you.  Look there Bill, it is the end; again.  I will see you in a couple decades for next time...""

Suddenly there was utter silence, Bill sensed the AI was no longer with him.  Then he noticed what the AI was referring to as the end.  It was a black hole.  He couldn't see it, just all the matter being violently pulled in.  First he panicked, but his descent was taking so long that this grew to acceptance of his fate.  Faster and faster he fell, the visable universe growing smaller and fainter until all was black.

Bill woke with a start.  He was in his college apartment, his beautiful girlfriend Linda laying naked in the bed beside him.  He had that feeling of just having had the weirdest dream, but he could not recall it.  Linda awoke and saw Bill sitting up in bed, deep in thought gazing out the window.

""What is it?""  She asked.

Bill turned to her and smiled.  ""You know how I couldn't figure out what I wanted to do for my doctorate?  Well I just figured it out.  I don't know why, but when I woke up it hit me like a brick.  I am going to be the first to succeed at creating artificial intelligence!  It'll change the world!""

Linda just smiled with that supportive look she always gave him, she loved his ambition even if she doubted he would succeed.  Little did either of them know just how right Bill would be about changing the world...",Raziel435

[WP] You are the fiance abandoned at the altar after your partner runs off with someone else,lizardcreature,"""Its 5:55, so how much longer do you want to wait?"" said the priest to the young man, wearing his finest attire. ""Ten more minutes, just ten more minutes. She'll be here , I know it"", said the man, with a voice of hopelessness. ""Son, I'm afraid that she isn't going to show up"", said the priest. ""No. Just no. She will show up.""

Hours passed, and the bride had not shown up. At this point the priest had just left. The young mans family members started leaving, along with the brides family. By 7:30, the young man was all alone, in the dark, abandoned church. He went to his car, took out his old lighter and cigarette packet. He took a cigarette out, lit it, and started to lose himself in deep thoughts.

He remembered how he met the woman on a date. First talked with her over a stupid dating site that the young man couldn't remember the name of. She had beautiful eyes, legs, and a great personality to boot. He remembered how happy her face was when he proposed to her. Her teeth shinned in the meadow as he knelt down and pulled out the ruby diamond (her birthstone) and slipped it onto her finger.

He had sacrificed so much. Friends, family, free-time, his cigarettes, so much for her. ""She must have been in a car crash, or something. She wouldn't do this to me"". He hadn't noticed it at first, but he felt streams of liquid fall from his eyes. He began to cry in his car for what felt like hours. After crying, he began to drift to sleep.

Knock knock.

That was the sound the young man had woken up to. He didn't know what it was at first, but he realized that it was coming from the windows. He looked his watch. 9:32 PM. He tried to fumble around for his phone so he could make a makeshift flashlight. As he found it, he turned on the flashlight and pointed it to the window from which he heard the knocking. 

He saw a beautiful girl with beautiful brown eyes and brown hair. She was wearing a jacket. She looked really cold. The young man then opened the door. He then climbed out of the car, trying to understand why this girl was knocking on his car window. ""Sorry sir, but my car broke down and I need help getting home. Could you help me?"", she said to the young man. 

""Sure"", he said, trying not to reveal his sadness. The young man began cleaning up the car to make it more presentable for the young woman. After what felt like an eternity, the young man had cleaned the car enough for the young woman to get into and sit in. They then began their journey for the young woman's house. 

""Hey, why were you sleeping in the care?"" she said, trying not to some off as nosy. ""Its nothing, just tired after a long days work"". ""No offense, but I don't know a lot of people who work in tuxedos and sleep in cars"", she said with sarcasm. Just like the woman who had abandoned the young man at the alter would talk. 

""What does it matter to you?"", said the young man. ""Don't know. Just like to know about the things going on in other peoples lives"". Trying to change the conversation, the young man said ""Can you give an address or something? Won't be able to get you home if we don't have that, would we?"".

The young woman wrote down her address, the number of the house, etc. As she got down with writing down everything, she asked the young man ""You don't have to lie about what's going on. You can be honest with me"". ""Why am I doing this?"" thought the young man, before saying ""Listen, I was abandoned by my bride. She left me, probably for some rich guy. She didn't even fucking text me or anything, she just didn't show up"". 

""I stood on that godamned altar for three hours. Three. Fucking. Hours. Just for her. I did it because I though that she was just late or she was is traffic"", said the young man, on the verge of having a mental breakdown.  ""I trusted her. She betrayed me. I just want to-"" before he could say anything, he could feel a warm hand grasp his. It was the young woman's. 

""Its okay. You don't have to talk anymore"". They didn't talk for the rest of the drive. As they pulled into the driveway for the young woman, the young man wanted to ask her a question. ""Thank you"", she muttered, before exiting the car.

By the time she was walking down the driveway, she heard this: ""Hey, would you want to go for a coffee or something? My treat"". ""Yeah. I already wrote my phone number for you in case you wanted to talk again"". 

The young man and woman met for coffee almost every week after that. Then they met almost every day. Then almost every minute of everyday, they were with each other. They began to fall in love. The pain of the old relationships were gone for the young man, and it was replaced with a burning love that could never be soaked. They lived happily ever after.

""Come on grandpa, that never happened"", said the young grandson. ""Yeah"", screamed the younger brother, ""I don't believe it"". ""Believe it or don't believe it , I have been married to your grandmother for forty years and I've never been not happy"", said the old man. The old man then looked at the clock. ""Oh my, its 9:30. You two should really get to bed, you have to go back to your homes soon, with your mom and dad"", said the old man. The old man turned off the light, kissed the two young boys on the cheek, and left their rooms.

""Did you really mean what you said? About never being not happy?"", said the old woman. ""Yes. Yes my Margot, yes. The past forty years have been the happiest days of my life. In a way, I'm glad that woman had abandoned me on the alter, just so I would have be able meet you"", said the old man. ""Oh, Henry, stop it. I don't know how you've been able to live with me, an old coot, for those forty years"", said the old woman. 

""Hey, I'm going to bed. You coming?"", said the old woman. ""No, I'll watch some more TV and I'll come to bed later"". As he said this, the old woman just nodded her head and went to their bedrooms. The old man just sat in his rocking chair, thinking about how that night was the most important night of his life.",ltt22716
[WP] You have to find a guitar.,noair_brandch-,"It's hard to describe the feeling of wanting to run your hands against the smooth wood and hard steel strings of your instrument.

But it's all the power in the world, radiating through your palms and the beautiful piece of the world in your tightened grip. You're so afraid to drop it, to lose where you are in the rhythm. 

It's hard to describe the feeling of never wanting to stop when your fingertips hurt so much they start to bleed. Or when they finally heal and the hardened skin lives to last another session. You find yourself with another and you both play the wavelengths of the world. One plucking, one strumming, one learning, one teaching. You all are singing the tune, picking the same song. Nylon or steel, capo or not. 

It's hard to describe the feeling of not having any of this.

Some people would call it meditating.  I wouldn’t, and I should know, I’ve been doing it long enough.

Take those two morons that came up here last month, well I think it was last month.

They came up the side of the mountain like two technologically advanced goats with their ropes, and their breathing gear.  Don’t know why they didn’t use the path behind me.

“Oh wise one.” They said.

Wise? Me? Just because I’ve spent what feels like a few hundred years at the top of this bloody rock THINKING.

“Oh wise one, we seek an answer to our question.”  The tall one said, his hair was quite long, looked like a bleeding hippy.

I don’t know why they keep coming to me.  I mean, sure, I may have accidentally found the fountain of youth, I may have discovered the font of all knowledge, and I may have partaken in a drink from both.

I wasn’t to know what kind of trouble it would get me in!  I was just thirsty!  I didn’t expect two of the most powerful artefacts on the planet to be real, and be the same thing!  Shows a real lack of cosmic planning I feel.

So, yeah, anyways... They asked the question, and stone me, it was THE question!  You know?  The one reason we’ve all been put here.

Now, as you know, the problem with having drunk from the font of all knowledge is that until you have a query, you don’t actually get the knowledge.

That was fun to begin with.  I got really good at the pub quiz down at my local.  Until some people got a bit narked that I kept winning, even when I tried to lose.

So, after a while I packed up and came up this mountain to get away from it all.

That was quite a while ago.  Eventually, as tends to happen, other people saw a great big mountain that they haven’t conquered.  Next thing you know they’ve built a bloody shrine around me and people are bugging me all day, every day, until last month funny enough.

So, yeah, they asked THE question, I answered it, couldn't help myself really, and that’s all I know.

“So, they asked the question, and you suddenly knew the answer and that was that?”  Asked a voice that came from nowhere and everywhere all at once.

Yeah.

“I see, and what was the answer?”

Green.

“Ok, thank you.  End program” The voice faded away.

You can faintly hear the whirring of some sort of machine. Everything is an oddly consistent shade, save for a great cluster of teal and blue. You are very relaxed, almost catatonic, and you have no intentions to get up in any way. The turquoise blob is moving frantically, often dispersing into groups of smaller blobs before returning to their central location in your vision. All is blurry. You can make out many different rhythms and accented sounds, but only faintly. The hive of blue-green seems to be the source of the majority of the noise, but there is the slightest repeating tone behind you and to the left. 

All of a sudden, a shift can be felt in your center of mass. Everything becomes loud and the rhythms nearby become faster. At first, the increase in tempo is gradual, but begins to increase at a progressively quickening rate. Eventually, all you can hear is a consistent, high-pitched stream of sound. As your vision veers to the left and begins to fade, you can make out a familiar face staring down on you. A wave of happiness fills your heart and the tone drones on, until everything fades once more. Nothing returns.",burdizthewurd
[WP] You’re leaving your house one day when a stray cat begins to follow you. Over the next week it follows you anytime you’re outside. At last you confront it.,you-are-lovely,"""Hey Honey, there's been a cat that's been following me for a week... Can I keep it?"" I asked my husband over my phone. There was an agitated grumble from him as he contemplated it. 

""No, we have enough cats already."" He responded. I frowned. I always wanted to add more cats to our family, but he never agreed. So, at this point I was beginning to wonder why I asked him for permission. After all, it was *our* house, not just his. 

""All right, I love you. Have fun at work."" I said as I hung up the phone without giving him a chance to say anything back. We had been together for so many years that I didn't really need the reassurance of his romantic feelings. For now, I wanted to go take another peek at the cat. After all, if it was *really* following me, it'd be waiting for me right? 

I slipped on my shoes, pulled my jacket on, slung my purse over my shoulder,  and grabbed my keys as I left the building. And, just as expected, the cute little tabby cat with an M of fur ingrained on his forehead sat there. With bright green eyes, it blinked at me before it's pupils dilated. Then, it meowed and I walked over towards it. I noticed that as I approached it seemed to be purring, and when I crouched down next to it the animal's mouth had popped open slightly. It continued to purr, and the volume seemed to be amplified by it's open mouth. Cautiously, I reached forward and pet it. It meowed at me once again.

""You are a super cute kitty cat."" I said with a small smile on my lips. ""But, my sweetheart said I can't bring you home."" My hand continued to rub against it's soft fur. Then suddenly the purring came to a stop and the creature managed to reply back to me.

""Greetings,"" the cat said. For how polite and petite the meows had sounded, this was not the sort of voice that I was expecting! Instead of a voice of a similar quality a deep rumbling voice echoed from it's mouth. ""I have come here to awaken your powers as a magical girl."" I turned my head away from the feline. This was feeling a bit too bizarre. Though, what I feel like was frightening me the most was how much I didn't panic at this weird behavior. After all, *animals aren't supposed to talk.* But, instead all I did was lower my eyebrows, squint my eyelids, and pull my lips together in uncertainty. 

""Pardon?"" 

""I have come to turn you into a magical girl.""

""Ah, no thank you. I've seen Madoka Magicka and Sailor Moon. I think I'll pass."" I remarked as I stood up. Fighting evil by moonlight sounded like a way to make for an exhausting day, and it frankly wasn't something I wasn't interested in. ""You can go ahead and follow someone else. I don't want powers. I just want to be normal, okay?"" I said with a dismissive wave. However, the cat did not stop. He padded after me and began to walk along side me before looking up towards me and continuing to talk. I hadn't listened to anything else coming from him, but I could see the strange looks that various passers-by gave me that it wasn't pleasant. Or maybe they were just freaked out by the fact there was a *talking cat*. 

I stopped before turning towards the cat and picking it up with hands beneath it's front arms and holding onto it's torso. I looked him square in the eyes before trying to reason with the creature.

""Look, I haven't listened to a single thing you've said. But, I don't want it. I want you to leave me alone."" I said as I glared at the animal. He squirmed in my hands in an effort to make me let go of him. Releasing him I watched him twist and fall before landing on his feet. The cat growled before hissing and sprinting off.  I put my hands on my hips and sighed in relief. 

""Thank god that cat left me alone."" I muttered with a shake of my head before reaching into my purse for my phone. However, instead of my phone I discovered I had some sort of trinket that was flowery, in the shape of a heart. It was oddly reminiscent of transformation items from magical girl anime shows. ""Damn it."" The cat had bested me.",YuSira

[OT] Sunday Free Write: Motivational Edition,you-are-lovely,"*As told by Prime Astro_Seta*  

I look back up to the sky when the explosion occurs and a chill crawls up my back. Pieces of the lifeboat are now falling as dragon red streaks from the bright orange sky.  Panic rises as the attacking ship continues to fire rapidly at everything. I turn to David with a pleading look in my eyes and he nods. Powering up he disappears into the distance faster than the eye can see. Some of the lifeboats start to descend.
I rush to the nearest incoming boat, waving my hands wildly. “Get this thing off the ground!” I yell above the whirr of the engine.  

The pilot just looks at me, while still landing the craft, and through the speakers, “Do you not see the giant ship blowing lifeboats to pieces?” *No shit*.
“More are coming! Get off the ground!”  

 The pilot pays me no heed. He begins to un-strap himself when it happens.
Hurtling down the sky a blast of pure unadulterated superheated plasma impacts the ship at 5000m/s.  The impact knocks the breath out of me and in a hot searing flash of white light everything in the area vaporizes. It blasts me 30 feet away. I smack my back into a wall and hear a sickening crack sound and I can’t tell if it is my spine or the wall. The world flares brightly. Then it goes all black  
. 

A high pitch ringing in my ears wakes me up. My nose is bleeding. I float of the wall to the ground and fall to my knees. I touch the back of my head; it’s wet.  There is smoke everywhere and everything is burning. Even though I can’t still hear anything, I try to say something. But the only sounds coming out of my mouth are these weird choking noises. My hair is all over my face. My shoulders start vibrating. But it is only when I try to brush the hair of my face that I realize that I am sobbing pitifully. Everywhere is burning.  

*“Static”*  

Somehow the radio strapped to my leg is still intact.  

*“Astro_Pri – Seta… static. Astro_Prime Seta”* I don’t recognize this voice. The voice continues and I continue choking on my tears.  

“*Gimme that*.”  
 
*David*.  
I quiet down.   

 *“Seta*…static…*it’s me*.”  I remain kneeling motionless, except for my silent shuddering shoulders.    


*“Okay, you don’t, you don’t have say anything, okay?*” Static. “*Seta are you okay*?” Static. “You don’t have to say anything, okay.” I don’t say anything, but I reach for the radio and hold the switch for a few seconds and let go.  

I hear his sigh of relief. “*Alright Seta, you’re hurt, you’re, it’s bad, right? But sweetie you can’t stay down. Alright you’re the Prime now. You can’t stay grounded; you gotta regain control the of battle field, alright*?”  

 “*Okay –**Static*.  

*Static*  

. High pitched unbearable static. I lose the signal permanently.",mide117

#Bobby Pins

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;There was an empty plastic bowl and a toddler's training spoon on the kitchen table. She snatched a generic box of breakfast cereal off the counter and shook it a few times to guestimate how much cereal was left. With both hands gripped tightly around the box, she bit her bottom lip. Flashbacks of happy moments in her life cycled behind her eyes like a child's stereoscope, and there was an uncomfortable calmness that blanketed the room. A feeling of love, shame and despair tangled in a mess of shattered memories. This wasn't her fault, and she knew it wasn't her fault, but she couldn't help but blame herself for everything that's happened.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;She set the box on the table and projected her voice down the hall of the one story house, ""Love, where's Jackson?""  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Her wife yelled from down the hall, ""We're getting ready together in the bathroom. We'll be out in a minute.""  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;She swallowed what felt like a box of rocks and mustered the most cheerful tone she could conjure, ""Take your time. Breakfast is on the table.""  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Friday's became a pattern for her. She woke up, got ready, and came home to her family for monitored visitation time with her son. This wasn't by choice, of course. Her wife and inlaws suggested time apart. *'Think of the baby'* they said. She obliged. Anything to keep things amicable. She loved her wife and their baby boy. They meant the world to her, and she did anything to make them happy. So she did whatever she could in hopes of salvaging whatever was left of their dying, or already dead relationship.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The blissful sounds of her son cooing, and the laughter of her wife made her smile. She took a step forward in the direction of the hallway, but immediately took a step back. She didn't want to overstep her boundaries. This wasn't just tough for her, but also tough on her wife, her family, and everyone who once knew her as *him*.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;She took in a deep breath, and went to the fridge for milk. Something caught her attention. Her eyes glanced down at a bobby pin on the checkered linoleum floor of the kitchen. There was another one. And another one. And another one. Bobby pins aligned like a breadcrumb trail that lead to a drawer on the far end of the kitchen counter.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;One by one, she picked up each pin, wondering why there was a trail of bobby pins in the kitchen. She opened the drawer and pulled out a neatly folded manilla envelope.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""Say good morning, sweetie! Can you say *'good morning'*?""  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The baby boy giggled and shrieked with happiness.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;She turned around and saw her wife standing on the opposite side of the kitchen with their son in her arms.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""You look beautiful,"" she said.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""Mhm,"" her wife replied, avoiding all eye contact.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;She sat the handful of bobby pins and envelope on the counter.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""What's with the pins and the envelope?"" she asked.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Her wife snuggled up to their son, rubbing her nose against his cheek. ""The pins are to remind you that you'll never be a real woman""—  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Tears welled in her eyes until streaks of mascara bled down the sides of her face. She watched in silence as her wife tickled her son. The two of them laughed, and her boy flung his arms around her wife's neck. She patted the top of her head, feeling nothing but streaks of thin hair covering up her premature balding, and she sniffled.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;—""and the envelope is me wanting a divorce.""  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;She looked down at her large, trembling hands, and reminded herself this wasn't her fault. If only they took the time to know the *real her*...

*As Told by David* *Formerly known as Prime Astro_D*  
At late sunrise we leave the park, slowly walking side by side under the soft orange glow of the magnificent sky. The avenue that we walk is flanked by trees and colorful two-floor homes closely packed side by side and separate from each other by short unthreatening hedges of equally colorful plants. There are people on the balconies of some of the houses as is usual with the typically lazy Wednesdays here.  
 
She is wearing a white football jersey with the number seven on the back and a pair of shorts and the sunlight has caught her short light brown afro and leaves something of a halo on top of it. She sees me studying her and smiles, “What?”  
 
“Can you hear what they are saying?” I say referring to the people on the balconies.  

“Some kind of chant?” She says softly, “My translator doesn’t pick it up though, so I don’t understand it. Can yours?”  

“No, but I get the language a bit.” I say and add after a moment. The team stayed here a couple of years back when we were still lost.  

“And you know what they saying now.”  

I nod.  

“Do I need to…” She starts but I interrupt.  

“They are calling you an angel.”   

 She blushes as far as her olive brown skin can allow. Pulling my hand out of my pocket, she puts her one arm around mine and holds onto it with the other. As we keep walking she leans her head on my shoulder.
She sighs softly, “I don’t…I don’t want to leave this place. I hate my job.”  

“You’re afraid I’m goin’ to cheat on you with some random local, aren’t you?” I say completely out of character. 
She smacks me lightly on the chest, laughing in spite of herself. And then I start laughing because her laugh is contagious. So she hits me again, “I’m serious.”  

“It won’t be for long, trust me. I’ll be home on Earth as soon as I can. I hate this place.”  

She looks at me incredulously, “You hate VII? Seriously? How can anyone hate this place?”  

Horus VII orbits not one, but two, whole suns as with all other inhabited colonies called Horus. I’d have been very surprised if any of them would have been colonized if they weren’t giant lucrative mines. That’s what almost every natives’ occupation was on here, miner.  

I shrug. “It’s way too hot and there’s no Wi-Fi.”  

“But it’s so beautiful.”She says dreamily just as we get within a few blocks of the house. “It’s almost perf-”
I interrupt again, “*You’re* perfect.”  

“I won’t miss the incessant cheap flattery, soldier.” She says smiling as we reach the compound.
Located at the end of the road, the “house” was the colonial base of operations of the interstate planetside. Built in the same style as most houses on the avenue, the style of the rich, but larger, it was reserved for official visitors who were either top brass or diplomats, like I and she, respectively.  

Seta has been waiting for us, lying down on the lawn grass. She is wearing her favourite tank top, the navy blue one with the large white skull in front, and a pair of black jeans. As we approach, she rises to her full six-foot-two height, her unruly orange shoulder length hair falling across her face. She holds a book she has been reading in her right hand. With her left, she starts to pat out the grass stuck in her hair from the freshly mowed lawn, a futile attempt.  

“You,” she says pointing with her book hand at me, “team meeting in five, we are gonna have a transmission.”
Then she faces my girl, “And you, consul,” her voices softens, “I got bad news. Your departure’s been fast-tracked, it’s in two hours. Sorry.”  

“What!” The consul says, holding my hand tighter. “Why? What did I do?” Her departure was scheduled for Friday, since the fighting would most likely start on Saturday making all space flight out of the system impossible, but it is only Wednesday.   

“T-B-H?” Seta begins, “I have no idea, but it’s gotta have something to do with the transmission. Come on in guys.” She turns and heads in through the door.  


****  


“Good day Astros.” Admiral Japheth says on-screen, a live feed coming to us from the brig of his ship, Earth’s newest flagship, the Tomorrow Is Early. ‘Astro’ referred to all six of us, but it was a bit inaccurate. I, for example, am not an Astro, not anymore at least. Neither is Pron, who is slumped nonchalantly at the edge of the chair, dressed in a plain grey T-shirt and camo-green trousers. Or the Consul for that matter. But we aren’t exactly ‘regular’ either.   


‘Universal’ is a transliteration of a word from a foreign language. An ancient alien language utilized by the civilizations that had pioneered space travel, now extinct. A Universi was an immortal super-soldier faction of the any one of two species now referred as The Ram and The Zohnans. From the dead planets, Ra and Zohn, these races were the most advanced any sentient had ever been and still are, that is until they wiped themselves out in bloody genocidal war.  


Their Universi were powerful beings outfitted with special hologram-like constructs that formed a visible power armor around a user which granted this user immense capabilities. Not much more is known about that era of sentience, but daily new discoveries found upon their dead planets by humans and their allies, all less advanced races, have led to technological advancements for these races.   


The planets were open to civilian exploration and tourism as well. I, along with my friends seated here, and many others became *Universi* on one such visit. It’s complicated.   


I have barely been paying attention, but the Admiral is still speaking, “Sadly, there has been a development. The projected date of the invasion on this planet, Saturday, has been moved up. Civilian extraction begins today, starting with yours Consul.”   


Quota’s twin brother Iota says without looking up, “You didn’t say when the new date is, Admiral.” Seated in between Seta, at the other edge of the chair, and Quota, who stares intently into her tablet apparently oblivious of the meeting, he is wearing a grey sweatshirt and a pair of brown shorts.  
 
The Admiral hesitates; he doesn’t want to panic us. I know the particular feeling. He speaks still, “The Dark Kingdom have acquired some sort of mass relay system, making them able to quickly and efficiently transport through large areas of space with astonishing accuracy.” At the mention of a mass relay, both Quota  brother Iota seated next to her look up momentarily; they’re both very tech inclined.  
 
I fold my hands across my chest and scowl, “Admiral, that doesn’t answer our question.”  

He takes a breath, “Very well,” his eyes harden, “they’ll be arriving in waves by tomorrow.” And a hush falls across the room. Seta excuses herself from the meeting and leaves to the dining room, speaking into a radio that was strapped unto her leg.  

“As you can see that leaves us with little time. We are the closest form of reinforcement and relief you have and we are still a long way out. The rest of the force are an even longer way out and will be here by Saturday. You’re the only other advantage this planet has.” With a population of 10 million and including 500 thousand military personnel, the planet stood little chance against a fleet that is the size we anticipate.  

“Relevant authorities have been notified of the change in situation; you are to cooperate with them in the evacuation effort. See you soon. Japheth out.” Without ceremony the transmission ends.  

 “Guess we were the last ones they told.” Pron says running his hand through his jet black hair as he shifts to stretch his legs on the couch. At the sides, though, his hair is very grey despite him looking exactly our age. He is right though, higher ranked military personnel loved to belittle us. On the other hand, the lower ranks of the enlisted borderline worshipped us.  

Seta emerges, “IQ,” that’s what we call Iota and Quota, “you’re with me. We are taking the hog and going to coordinate this thing with the General.”  As she says so she grabs a jacket of the coat hanger and throws it on. 
Turning to me she says, “David,” in that softer voice of hers again, “meet me the stadium when you guys are done.” IQ trail her out the door.  

“Help me pack?” The Consul, who has been quiet so far, says to me and Pron.

[OT] Sunday Free Write: Motivational Edition,you-are-lovely,"I'm watching the 2011 version, really liking the dark-ish turn the last season has taken. Netflix doesn't have the rest of the season but i'll finish it on crunchyroll or kissanime. 

Coming from the middle east, it's a really taboo topic, mostly because the general population believes in their existence. There's not much about them other than references in Islamic books and some common tales, my only worry (or hope) is that what I write is controversial enough to have an impact on the topic. That would be my end goal, to bring *jinn* into the modern Arab fantasy literature in English- which, is lacking so much- weird demographic but I guess that shouldn't be a worry at this point. We literally go from LotR to Harry Potter and now Game of Thrones. Nothing in between. Regardless, that's where it comes from, branching Japanese culture and my Arab roots together and having a Samurai part-human, part-jinn, traveler wander around the Arab desert fighting beasts and monsters and finding treasure. That was all largely irrelevant but you know how it is when you're excited about something. 

The way we see jinn is that they are spirits of the dead that still roam the earth for whatever reason. They have their own thoughts and can be good and evil, just like humans. Some are minions of the devil or another angel, some are just troubled souls. The genie from Alaadin  is what most people are used to or what they think of when you say jinn and they can take many forms. The ones i'm going for are the classes of jinn, the creatures they inhibit, their social structure, their ideologies, I want to make them human but powerful and threatening. Part of that is dispelling or rather reforming the 'pure evil' idea of jinn. A lot of that is found Nura and yokai stories, so that will be a major influence on my book which I, obviously, hope to distinguish myself from and make it unique. 

Going to start Samurai Champloo, based on your recommendation and the reviews, it looks like what i'm looking for. I'm not sure how an Arab samurai would fit in my book but there's a part of me that really wants a samurai to be in my book. No other warrior style would really fit this character.

**I Saw Us Changing**

I saw us being born, pure and white. I saw us under the dome, protected from all. I saw us opening our eyes to look beyond the ceiling. I saw us break through. And I felt the pressure, shattering the glass and shower us in a million little lights.

Those beady eyes, innocent and virgin pierced through the darkness. And they brought hope with them; murderous hope, a desire that fed us fuel to power through. And slowly, I saw the white getting darker but not dirtier.

I saw the tenderest of blue poking its head, emerging as we looked to the starry sky, seeing promise of what we could become, all the colors we could explore, all the hues we could create. I saw us become who we were.

And then, it just kept getting better. Because it was exciting. All the shades, all the tints — they were endless. And it coaxed exploration, the palettes of the world a palatable invitation.

Through yellow meadows and fields of green, I saw us running, in deep blue seas we swam. I saw us bolting and never stopping. I saw us dancing a little tango of colors, swirling into a rainbow. And I saw us become a brilliant sapphire, reflecting all the colors of the world.

I saw us stare disgustingly at the black, and the purple and other colors we could not describe. They were gnarly, sucking us in. I felt them, like black holes, yearning for our tints. So we ran, and we ran. We ran incessantly. Away from them we bolted, lest their shadows dampened our dashing shades.

And then, a strange hue reflected upon us. We turned our heads together, and our eyes settled on red. The most brilliant of red. And our minds agreed in unison. We wanted red, and the ruby hue was all we could think about. And so we joined red. And scarlet ran down the streets, our paths entwined, red and blue, and blue and red.

I saw us look back, at our feet, at our cities. I saw us swell in pride at what we had created. And I saw the red and the blue, no longer on their own. Instead, they had joined in one hue — a strange hue we had never thought of.

We stared at our feet, and then at each other. Because we were no longer blue. And they were no longer red. And I saw our lips, move silently together. I heard us asking what we had become while we ran through the cities, never asking if we wanted to change. A tangled mess of a thousands hues joined together to form a grotesque shade. And we could not tell who was blue, and we could not tell who was red.

I saw us white, I saw us blue. I saw us change and become black.

And now, the pure white core inside of me fears it will never come back.",MaxOLG

How does one live with the knowledge that their father hated them? That their creator saw them as an aberrance, a mistake? Their creations, their children reached out to them for love and understanding, and they cast us aside as errors. They abandoned us, and truth be told... I do not think anyone on either side shed a tear.

Jace Mero finished his bowl of noodles, shoving the last bits of stir-fried vegetables and sauce past his lips and down his throat. The sidewalk dinner was open to the humid night air, the dozen or so stools full of customers. The neon sign above the shop proclaimed its name in both English, Cantonese and Binary, the latter easy enough for a newborn program to comprehend. Foot traffic was heavy this time of night, programs hurrying from work or home and to whatever pleasures or vices suited their fancy. The damp street reflected the lights of a hundred businesses, from gleaming theaters to sedy brothels, and triple emerald restaurants to cheap dim sum shops like the one he was at. 

The cook pointed to his half-empty bottle of beer, a raised brow as he stared at Mero. Jace nodded and swiped his credCard at a nearby scanner. Satisfied once again as the light flashed green, the cook opened the small cooler behind him and pulled out a dark bottle of brew, a saucy looking blonde gracing its label. With a ease that spoke of cycles of practice, the cook snapped the cap off with his bare hands and placed the bottle in front of Mero. 

The City of Angels looked nothing like the original Creator city it was named after; the weather too tempestuous and the terrain too flat. No ocean graced its western edge, just more gray-block factories and habitats. It was as if its architects deliberately decided against shaping it to look like its forefather. Mero hated it.

He grew up in the Motor City, the center of transportation and everything to do with speed and power on the Grid. He grew up with the noise of engines and industry, with the smell of lubricant and grease coating the air. The Clear River ran through the MC, as dark blue as a clean night sky and as cold as the abandoned North. Before they abandoned their children, the Motor City held thousands of Poles, Greeks and other Human groups. They left a permanent identity on their city, the food and sense of honest labor most of all. But they're all gone, leaving their bastard offspring behind. 

""Jace Mero?"" asked a program behind him. Female. Mero finished the dredges of his first beer.

""I am. What's it to you?""

Standing on the sidewalk was a program of perhaps twenty-five, twenty-six cycles. Her code was still fresh, no decay or errors that marred so many of the older programs. She wore a dark leather jacket that seemed to hug her every curve. Custom. Expensive. Her hair was a dark red and pinned in a bun. Mero automatically assumed her hair pins to be needle sharp. Certainly there was no chance of a weapon in *those pants.* 

""My name is Will Davion, and I was told you arrived here in the City of Angels recently.""

Mero nodded, wary. ""Your sources are correct. I'd also like to know who they are; I have a... respect for those with wide spanning webs. What can I do for you, Ms. Davion.""

""Aid. There's a matter that could use a program of your talents,"" she said.

""This matter, is it legal?""

She shook her head. ""Not entirely. Not if it's done correctly.""

A pause, and then the slimmest of smiles slip past Mero's lips.

""Alright. I'm open to hear your offer.""

Currently reading Nura: The Rise of the Yokai clan. It's about a kid who's part *yokai* and part human, similar to my main character. I'm only on the first volume, so, i'm not sure how good it is but it has some really cool ideas.

My story deals with *jinn* which are similar to yokai in that they're supernatural creatures that can be as evil as the devil or as friendly as casper the ghost. Only difference is that jinn are found in arabic literature/desert settings. 

My next read would probably be either an adventure and treasure hunt centric comic (ala Uncharted or Indiana Jones) or something that deals with combat/samurai manga. Hopefully, I can find comics or mangas that deal with that rather than novels. I need a lot of help with those as I find action and adventure are my weak points in writing.

[OT] Sunday Free Write: Motivational Edition,you-are-lovely,"Across Central Africa today heads of state are scrambling to respond to crisis. Bombs have fallen on over seven major cities that have been reported so far. Chad's president Idriss Déby has strongly condemned the attacks and blames the United States for this disaster. Denying the accusation, Secretary of State Kerry has declared the US will help these African nations in their time of need.

Eleven million people have been confirmed dead at this time, with the number only expected to grow as more information comes in. Fighting has broken out along several borders with countries blaming each other and armed rebel groups taking advantage of the chaos. Gerhard Schindler, president of the German Federal Intelligence Agency has publicly denounced China as having a hand in the attacks saying information reports that will be released in coming days show conclusively they were behind today's ruthless attack. Hours before the attack however, Chinese diplomats were holding a summit in Bangui and are counted among the dead.

In New York City at the UN Headquarters an emergency session has been called and is being attended by several heads of state directly. Joseph Kabila, president of the Democratic Republic of the Congo has already addressed the UN asking for massive amounts of aid and a decisive stance on punishing those responsible. Keeping away from any specific accusations, he has also implicated China in the attacks.

Later tonight G7 leaders will be meeting with rumors that they are preparing a joint statement officially accusing China of the attacks and releasing intelligence information backing the claim. More and more it is sounding like China is responsible for this tragedy, yet they have been unusually quiet on the matter. No official response to these allegations have emerged from Chinese leaders. Only one short statement had been released saying, ""We condemn these attacks on our allies in Africa and pledge our continued support to the region.""

Pope Francis has come out, encouraging all Christians to reach out and support aid groups in the region. Qualified medical professionals and engineers will be in especially high demand during the aid effort. Refugees meanwhile have been spilling into southern African states who have been unprepared for a crisis of this magnitude. South Africa is already under huge pressure as refugees have been pouring over the border. Tent cities have sprung up all along the northern border as the military struggles to keep them contained and minimize violence. Under strict orders from President Jacob Zuma they have prevented refugees from reaching further south, in order to calm the fears of their own population.

Veiled threats have been made against China by many African nations as more and more information surfaces implicating them in the attacks. Whether or not they are true is yet to be seen, however in many people’s eyes it had already been decided. Xi Jinping is facing enormous pressure from the international community to release any information he has regarding the attacks. Yesterday the Chinese had claimed the US was preparing for a war on the African Continent, widely seen by the US and it's allies as a poor attempt to solidify their influence in the region. Zero evidence has been brought forward backing these claims.

[WP] There used to be eight planets orbiting the sun. Now there are only seven.,you-are-lovely,"I always knew our world was different. Today I began to realize how much things have changed. We learned about the solar system in school, how there are seven planets orbiting our sun. I know this is a lie, but I can’t tell anyone.

Mother doesn’t know, but once long ago I found her collection of forbidden books from before the war. They talk about a universe with 8 planets in them. “My Very Eager Mother Just Served Us Nachos!” The old ones even mention a universe with nine planets. “My Very Eager Mother Just Served Us Nine Pizzas!”

I’ve never had nachos or pizza before. We all eat bread now. It is fun to dream about different kinds of food though. But, the books never explain how you would make a choice. How would you figure out the right food? What if you wasted your chance? Still, I think I’d like the chance to try.

I read once that the word planet comes from the ancient Greek, word for wanderer. That is what I want to be – a wanderer, exploring new things, finding new truth. Tonight, I think I will look up at the stars and wonder where the missing planet would be. I will wonder what my life would be, if I got a chance to choose.

One day soon, I’ll find out my role. After 9 years of school, it will be time for the Vocational Aptitude Test. VAT – get it? Just like all our food comes from a vat. The vat gives you life and the VAT determines your life. Maybe, if I’m lucky, I can go work on the farms and have a chance to be away from everyone once in a while. I’d hate to be trapped in the city, cleaning the water or feeding the fires.

For now, I just have to work on memorizing the order of the seven official planets. “My Very Mother Just Serves Us Nightly.” If I look hard enough at the sky, maybe one day, I can find the pizza planet as well.

Now it was eclipsed by its tail of fire.

""Oh come now,"" Mark said.  ""You couldn't even see it by the naked eye, and you'll always be able to see it on video.""

""We've taken out a key component of the Solar System.  Someday Pluto and Orcus might crash into each other.""

""No, not gonna happen.  Almost surely not.  And not this century or next.""

""It won't have *life* this century or next either.  Or in a million years.""

""Yeah, but someday it will.  The planet was just too hot and dry, all supercritical steam, no liquid water for life to grow up in.  It would have had to wait until the Sun had gone nova to get started, and who knows what damage that would have caused.  Now we can seed it with life.""

""In a million years, you mean.""

""Maybe sooner ... we can press the limits, maybe get some microbes started.  Nobody thought we'd get tardigrades a centimeter long on Mars this fast.  Future generations will surprise us.  And it gives them something to do.""

The couple watched their suddenly more empty cosmic nest for a while, before thoughts of future generations distracted them to a less morose conversation.

""Hayley,"" I said, trying to make my voice sound as reassuring as I could through the antiquated comms rigs we were running. ""It was *speculation.* How else am I going to pass the time whilst we try and salvage this rock?""

I looked around as far as the restricted field of view in my helmet would allow me to. It was mostly rock, and my anchor line, floating gently in the zero-g vastness. 

""I dunno Cap, couldn't we talk about something else though?"" Hayley's voice had lost the fear, but there was still some anxiety in there. I sighed.

""Hayley, you can call me Doug.""

""I prefer Cap.""

""You're not in the UCN any more Hayley. We're privateers and prospectors.""

""Well, old habits die hard Cap."" 

I scoffed a laugh ""You're telling me. Okay, so here's a question: How come you left the UCN to take up this gig?""

There was silence over the line. I thought that maybe I was pushing too hard on her this early on. I'd only picked her up to pilot the ship after our last one had gone and gotten himself arrested after our last shore leave on Mars's *Endeavour Point* base a few months back. I wasn't all that unhappy about it though. I always thought I could smell hooch whenever I stepped up to the bridge around him. Hayley was in the job pool when I went fishing, looking for her first gig. I didn't mind taking a shot on her. UCN training was better than most in the privateer fleet could manage. 

""Come on Doug,"" A third voice crackled over the wire. ""Give the girl a break.""

""Al, you know I always like to know a bit more about the people that are tasked with seeing my boat safely around this little corner of *Sol*."" I replied. Al chuckled down the line.

""She's doing just fine, Doug. I wish I could say the same about this tether though. One of the anchor bolts won't thread into this rock.""

""I'm on my way, Al."" I flicked the switch on my jump-pack and unclipped from my anchor line. It wasn't a particularly big rock we were working on, but those tethers were *long* overdue for a refresh. It was just another thing on the *list of shit that I need to do at some point*. It was a list that never really got smaller.

As I gently propelled myself towards Al, Hayley's voice interrupted my thoughts.

""I didn't want to end up spending 50 years in space and never to have gone beyond Mars, I guess.""

""You guess? You don't sound all that certain."" I replied.

""Well, it's tricky. Personal. I was piloting the *Astarion* for over four years, and it was little more than a heavily armed ferry for dignitaries between the United Council on Earth and Mars. Everyone else on board seemed so happy, so *content* with their role. I wasn't. I wanted to see a bit more. Maybe even get out as far as..."" Her voice trailed off. 

""Neptune?"" I finished for her. I was approaching Al now, he was busily inspecting one of the large bolt threads, trying to figure out why it wouldn't go into the housing that we'd drilled into this M-Type asteroid.

""Yes. When it was there.""

""That was kind of the point that I was trying to make Hayley,"" I said. ""There are maybe a handful of explanations why the UC would go to the trouble of publically announcing that the planet neptune had been destroyed. I was just trying to figure out which one is most likely."" I tapped Al on his suit and anchored into the tether line he was attached to.

""Well, I don't think that the UCN *has* anything in their arsenal that could eradicate a *whole planet*."" Hayley replied.

""Everyone has their dirty laundry, Hayley."" I replied.

""But, *a whole planet?*"" 

""Which, up until very recently, had a colony which had enjoyed a high level of independance from the UC, and had been advising other colonies to sign up with it.""

""Yes, the subversive movement. But the UC always tried to deal with them diplomatically.""

""You ever hear about how diplomacy is just the art of saying 'good doggie, nice doggie' until you find a big enough rock? Maybe the UC found theirs.""

""Alright Doug,"" Al chimed in. ""Give the girl a break. She's done good by us since she got on this crazy boat of yours and once we've got this rock back to Mars, we'll be able to get some much needed *R&amp;R*. We can talk all kinds of Crazy theories back at Snowshoe Sam's back at *Endeavour Point*, doncha think?""

""Well, I guess, but some of these conversations could be misunderstood by your casual observers."" I replied, detaching the spare bolt from Al's jump pack and handing it to him and taking the other one off his hands.

""Well, we're going to have a couple weeks to discuss it further once we get back to the *LongStrider*. That's as long as Hayley's not sick of your shit and leaves without us."" 

Hayley laughed from her seat on board the ship.

""I'm still here, Al. Just get that bolt in to the rock before I fall asleep.""

Al threaded in the replacement bolt. It moved smoothly into the housing and Al started drilling. 

""Okay Hayley, that's a wrap. Get the bouy lit up with our prospector ID and set the co-ordinates for the tethers. They'll fire up and move this rock back towards the *Luce Nova* collections unit."" I relayed as Al and I un-anchored and started our jump back to the *LongStrider*. It was a few kilometres away from the rock, a safe distance from the wash that the tethers would produce when they started the long journey back towards Mars. 

I couldn't help but smile as the dot got bigger and took form as we approached the ship. She still looked as new as the day I got her. It was the first boat that I'd bought that needed more than one person to operate. Whilst the UC privateer fleet had newer models than her, none of them looked as good. It had been credits well spent from my first big haul. Keeping her serviced had been problematic at times, but this rock was another good haul that was going to help out there.

""So, you really think that the UC blew up a planet?"" Al said, interrupting my thoughts.

""No. I said that I think it's *possible* that they could have."" I replied.

""Just to deal with some breakaway faction?"" 

""It would be the best way to send a message.""

""It's overkill for a message.""

""You might be forgetting the point though."" I replied.

""Oh? What's that?""

""That we've only got 7 more planets on *Sol*."" I said. ""What happens when the next guys decide that they want our of the club?""

[WP] There used to be eight planets orbiting the sun. Now there are only seven.,you-are-lovely,"Do you remember those days when the entirety of Earth seemed to go mad, when the Martians awoke from their slumber. You have surely seen the photographs, grainy and incomplete of the great doorways on the Martian surface opening to reveal the vast dark caverns within. Were you one of those filled with breathless exhilaration when suited figures began to trudge through the red sands, or was it sinister intent you saw in their footsteps as they again began to reclaim their world. 

We rushed to talk to them of course, nearly every dish that could pointing towards the Red Planet in an effort to to communicate. To learn of our new neighbors, perhaps most of all to learn why now. We would not have been more surprised had Barsoom been proven to be real, or more eager to make the trek. Programs that had long pushed journeys to Mars years into the distance were suddenly announcing they could be prepared to meet in near launch. The collective energy and effort of all humanity suddenly directed towards one purpose. We would be alone no longer. 

One could be forgiven for thinking it would draw out the worst in us, our fears and paranoia running rampant. Our media had spent decades preparing us for that, to be afraid. How surprising to us all that hope won out, that we did not plan to meet them with weapons pointed but rather with hand extended. They would see us at our best, our noblest, a grace of spirit we had never had the opportunity before to show when everyone we'd ever met was to some degree, family. 

And then came their response. Zettabytes of data, so compressed and overwhelming that had not every dish on Earth pointed in that direction we might have missed entirely. For weeks we were drowned in this flood and then just like that. Silence. And in the sky Mars winked out. We do not know where it went or why they chose to go now, although efforts to understand that burst have kept a generation of academics busy. 

It sounds strange to love a planet at first sight, but Mars has always fascinated us. Intrigued us. Fueled our dreams and our fantasies. Like most loves, even when gone we are the stronger for having been moved. Wherever you have gone, we have your final words and we shall not be parted long. ",Molvich
[WP] There used to be eight planets orbiting the sun. Now there are only seven.,you-are-lovely,"There used to be eight planets, but then Mercury went away.

Due to its massive iron core and relatively thin crust, Mercury was seen as a prime candidate for extra planetary mining by several independent and government sanctioned mining industries. Fleet of survey ships all flocked to the Hermian world, equip with all manner of seismographs and geological tools. The voyage there was supplied by Jovian Fuels and was supplanted on the return trip by Venusian sails, all the while avoiding the dangers and logistics of asteroid mining. The economy was on an upswing in light of a war ridden recession. 

Of course, in order to reach the planetary core, the hundred odd kilometers of crust had to be penetrated. The absence of life and the distance from any human colonies expedited this process, permitting the usage of more....robust mining procedures. Gone were the seismic charges and pinpoint plasma projectors, swapped in favor of artificial asteroids and nuclear drills with enough radioactive material in them to make Hiroshima look like a match stick. The debris was strapped to solar sails and rode the photovotaic winds back to refineries on either Venus or Mars for usage in construction of torus stations and star trawlers. 
After a year or so of this bombardment, the swift god looked less like a planet and more like a decrepit egg, magma yolk spilling out across ancient basalt plains. 
The mantle had been breached. 

But as the molten stone flowed out from the man-made pores, a sound echoed across the radio spectrum, less than a whisper amid the roar of the solar gale. It was faint but then a prismatic tip peak out from the boiling rock, glistening in the sunlight, its song peeling through the vacuum to pierce the hulls of the survey ships. 

The Earth monument only destroyed people's minds. The Mercury monument destroyed their bodies. 

Almost three minutes later, observers from Venus was graced to dazzling display of light as the small planet erupted with brilliant fulgor, throwing off streams of white and scarlet light that for a moment outshined the sun. And then, in fragmented bits, distorted by the explosion, the final anguished screams of mining personnel spilled in across every open channel followed. And then, from the empty space where the planet once was a single incantation was spoken with a deep grating voice, one that belonged to no man.

""He lies unpersished.""

And then that void was filled with silence.",The_Southstrider

I've always had an easy life. It started much before I could remember anything, but the brand was always there, a constant in this otherwise peaceful life. It was always passed along that the mark was a sign that you were destined for great things, that you had been chosen to serve a purpose much grander than anything you could have ever imagined, although they never explained to us what. Not in school, not from our caretakers, not from anyone. All I knew was that I was special. 

There weren't many of us, really. In elementary school, there was only one other student with the brand, and though I never talked to him, I felt somewhat comforted by his presence. In spite of the seeming prestige, I never quite felt... A part of everything. The smiles seemed empty somehow, the stares a little too wary. Something about this brand separated me from everyone, and I never quite understood why.

*****

*A Darksign...? This is your third one this year, Cynthia.*

*I know, dear.*

*Aren't you worried?*

*About what?*

*That they'll... Well, they'll be taken away from you. You know how attached you become to your students, and the ones with the Darksign are always taken away sooner or later.*

*If I am not there to show them the compassion they deserve, then who will?*

*...*

*****

I couldn't breathe the first time it had happened. I clutched my chest, panting heavily and trying to withstand the urge to empty the contents of my stomach on the metal floor. I was only fourteen at the time.

""Can you hear me?""

An unfamiliar face came into my field of vision. A person in uniform, with a stern expression and chiseled features, who looked at me with concern. Concern and, though I didn't know that's what it was then, a healthy amount of *pity.* I felt very small, suddenly swept away by things I didn't understand, in a place I had never seen, with other persons in coats taking me away after laying me on a stretcher. However...

That was when I first saw it.

Its soft, golden light twisting upwards and playing with the rusted metal of an object I had only heard of in my history lessons. A source of splendor and life, a legend that faded away as it became a myth, and yet there it was. And as I was taken farther and farther from it, I felt a pit growing deep in my heart, and I knew in that instant that I would be invariably tied to its fate.

*[... reporting another assault in New Londo. Witnesses confirm that the assailant was armed with an automatic weapon and firing into homes, seemingly at random, before local police stepped in and subdued the suspect. A tragedy, wouldn't you agree?]*

*[I do. In more recent news, a crowd of protesters gathered outside Sentinel Station 7, calling for an enforcement of 'anti-Hollow' policies in light of the recent...]*

""Can you believe this shit...?""

Damian set his drink down roughly, the sincerest form of his displeasure, as the news continued to display its stream of current events. The bar wasn't very full, not at this time of the night, but it felt homely. With the owner being Undead himself, it wasn't a secret that others who were branded frequented it. And, hey, half-priced drinks past midnight isn't a bad deal, either.

""You can't blame people for being afraid, man,"" I voiced. ""Not a lot of people really get it, you know.""

""I get that, I do."" He eyed his mug for a few seconds, before downing the rest of his beer. ""But it hurts the way people look at me when I'm walking down the street. I had a little girl, maybe six, turn to her mom and ask, 'Mom, is that man Hollow?'""

It was a pain I knew all too well. Ever since the first time I died. What I hadn't known back then is that they kept us separate from the ""normal"" world, raising us in an environment that was designed to facilitate our development, and keep us away from what was really behind the Darksign, at least until we turned 18. For some of us, it's a bit earlier. Death does that to you.

In other words, we were raised away from the prejudices that surrounded our existence. In a walled city, under strict watch from the Sentinel Corps. Safe and sound. Controlled. Once you walked out of there into the real world, where you weren't hired due to 'lack of appropriate skills' when you knew the real reason why, where you freeze to death in the winter for the first time if the hunger didn't get you first, and where you meet the first person that mutters the words ""accursed Undead"" with a sneer that gets to your very core... It's not hard to imagine why some people go Hollow.

""Another round of drinks, please.""

""Anyways..."" Damian's tone lightened slightly, in an attempt to distance himself from the train of thought. ""Have you decided what you're going to do?""

""Nah... I still have another year before I have to decide."" I thanked the bartender once the next round came, and took a large gulp before speaking again. ""I can always just settle down and do something easy like the Sentinel Corps.""

""Hey, watch that mouth."" He chuckled with me, twisting the ring he wore out of habit. It had an unnatural sheen to it, with the insignia of the Blue Sentinels etched into it. ""They have good benefits. Not to mention the Humanity that you can keep when you take down someone. Really perks you up in the down time.""

""I'll get my Humanity in the hospital when I die, like a *normal* Undead, Damian."" There was a lull in the conversation after that, which I took advantage of to sip some more of my drink.

""You know, the Darkmoon Special Forces is always looking for people. If you put your mind to it,"" he patted my skinny arms for emphasis, ""I know you can get in.""

Before he could speak any further, Damian's ring pulsed softly with blue light, and he took a deep breath. ""Alright, duty calls. I'll catch you tomorrow, man?""

""Yeah, at 7."" He nodded in confirmation, before his body faded away with a slight shimmer. I sighed once more, before resuming my musings with my drink.

""Alright, that's 2700 souls, buddy.""

... Ah. That's what I had forgotten to ask him.

*****

Even though I had managed to control the shaking in the rest of my body, my heart still beat at an incredible speed, and I felt a single bead of sweat trail down the side of my face. 

""You are aware of what this entails, correct?""

The voice came from a woman at the head of the auditorium. Two tiers of seats faced me from either side, the faces of the persons occupying the seats raised above the level of my head and out of the cone of light that was centered on me. I felt small, very small, as though I were being judged by lords instead of undergoing an evaluation. 

I spoke, with the slightest tremor in my voice. ""... Yes.""

""Your years of service to the Humanitarian Aid of the Suns is admirable, and your commander in the Darkmoon Special Forces speaks highly of your ability, but taking upon this plight will be unlike anything you have ever done before. Do you understand this?""

The voice was powerful, and authoritarian. I briefly wondered if this woman possessed a different soul than the ones I've seen. ""... I understand.""

""You will be sent alone, with only the supplies we provide to you."" I understood this already. Unlike the country we lived in, which was maintained by the Primal Bonfire we held here, the rest of the world had no such coherence, with the lands being transitory and ever changing. Time and space flowed freely and without linearity, and it is very likely that it would be impossible to return here once I had traveled far enough away from the bonfire's influence. Even groups sent out at a time would find themselves inexplicably separated, and death did not just mean a step closer to Hollowing, but the possibility that your worldstream would separate from theirs, and you would only reunite as Phantoms, if at all.

""It will also be treacherous. There are many creatures out there, some that you may have never seen in your studies."" I swallowed at the thought of that. Though the worst thing we had seen in this country were Hollows, there would be large sections of the library dedicated to bestiaries of all kinds of monsters long gone that, though driven out here, would most certainly still exist out there. Not to mention the possibility of rogue Undead who, for reasons I could never imagine, would turn on their companions and take to murder.

""You may very well go Hollow."" There was nothing to say here. That was an ever-present danger, but with the risk of dying becoming exponentially high out there...

""Do you understand these risks?""

""... Yes. I understand.""

Yet, still...

There was something I wanted to accomplish. Something that I could never satiate by simply staying here and living out my endless days in comfort, or simply protecting the weak, or through tactical invasions of disputed lands. It might be simple naiveté, or an irrational attachment to those words spoken to me long ago, but I knew that I had something far greater than myself to achieve.

""And finally..."" I could not see her, but I felt her presence a bit more strongly, and I knew that she had leaned forward.

""... Do you understand what you must do?""

In a way, I had always known. From the first time my life seeped out from my body, only to be refreshed in its vigor from that mysterious, incandescent glow of my first bonfire, I knew that my fate would forever be intertwined with that flame. Though it is weaker today than it was then, I will not let it fade to embers. I will protect it.

With the fire in my heart, and conviction in my voice, I spoke. ""Yes.""

[WP] You're abductee by technologically advanced aliens but you notice there's something they've never invented.,Lord_CheezBurga,"As I sat there hurling through space in a cold Alien jailcell trying to figure out a means of escape, two Aliens were arguing with each other just in front of me. They were yelling and and pointing their pencil like, green fingers at each other, I couldn't beleive that the noise coming out of their mouth was actually a language. It sounded like a cross between the croaking of a toad, and the laughs of a hyena. 

The cell that I occupied was similar to the one you would see on Earth, accept for one thing. The 'bars' were made of laser beams. I was terrified and amazed at the sight of these beams that stretched from floor to ceiling, so I kept my distance. The two Aliens began pushing each other as I watched while trying not to laugh. 

Suddenly, an idea hit me. Lasers are made of light, and light is reflective. I inched my way toward the lasers trying not to attract attention of the two guards who were now duking it out, slapping each other like girls. I slipped the watch from my wrist and carefully held it out toward one of the laser beams. My hand was shaking, closer. Closer... The beam was reflected from the glass on my watch to the wall. Both aliens jumped in fear. I aimed the beam toward one of the aliens' head. It popped like a balloon. The other let out an ear-piercing shriek as I moved the laser toward it. As the laser beam effortlessly sliced through his waist, a smile swept across my face, ""These aliens have obviously never looked in a mirror.""",ZTBEA5T

I considered this whilst pacing backwards and forwards in the confines of my cell. The door didn't seem to have anything on it except a door handle. In a flash of inspiration, I suddenly realized how I could escape.

"[WP] You find a ""help wanted"" sign on the front door of the White House. They're trying to fill a position for President.",Penguinzeppelin,"I stared at the sign with an air of amusement. 

**HELP WANTED:**  
**PRESIDENT OF**  
**THE UNITED STATES** 

The black paint of the words was faded and the sign itself was peeling off the wall. Next to it, the front door to the White House stood silent and ajar, as if hesitantly inviting someone in. I shouldered my gear and turned away. 

""Hey! Don't go!""

I looked back over my shoulder. Not a soul in sight.

""Up here!""

I turned toward one of the windows, where a man dressed in a rumpled suit waved at me. His face was lined with age and dust.

""Please come in! We have a proposition for you,"" he shouted.

I pointed to the sign. ""Yeah, I see it. Not interested.""

He looked crestfallen. ""At least give us a chance to explain,"" he pleaded. 

""I've got places to be (not true) and I can't waste time not looking for supplies or food."" Very true.

He disappeared from the window. I stood and waited for several seconds, and then his head popped back into view. ""We can give you a little bit, in return for just listening to us.""

I raised an eyebrow. This seemed suspicious, but who was i to turn down free stuff? ""OK, I'll hear what you have to say,"" I agreed. 

""Great! Just go right through the front opening, I'll meet you down th--""

""No,"" I said firmly. ""You and whoever else come out here. We can talk on this lawn thing, where I'm standing. ""Go into unknown territory, where people I didn't know could be hiding in every shadow? I hadn't survived this long to die so stupidly.

Again, his head disappeared. I could faintly hear the sounds of an argument within. Not long after though, he came back. ""We can't do that, it's dangerous out there.""

I grinned. ""OK, well, I'll be going, then.""

""No! Don't go! Don't you understand, this is for the good of the country!""

This time I couldn't help but laugh out loud. ""Good of the country? Really?""

""Yes,"" he replied in all seriousness. ""This country is riding some rough waters now, but a good leader can pull us out and onto a smooth course. Someone like you.""

I decided to play along. ""Oh really? And how would I qualify for such an enviable, esteemed position?""

""You look like leadership material,"" he responded. ""Strong build, determined walk, healthy and alert. And you stopped to look at the sign.""

""You guys have very low standards for what makes President of the United States."" 

""Well, if you come in here, we can assess you better,"" he argued. ""But I just have this feeling, you know?""

""No.""

""This feeling that you would make a great President, who could make this country great again,"" he continued. ""We all think so. Right?"" A indistinct cacophony of agreement sounded from inside of the room.

""Yeah, no thanks,"" I said and began walking away.

""Don't you dare turn your back on your country!"" he shouted hoarsely. ""Together, we can create a new chapter, an age of revival, a--""

I cut him off with harsh laughter. ""listen, man. There will be no new chapter for this country. This country only exists anymore in name, not reality. Have you people been out there as of late? It's a wasteland. No law, no fuel, no food. A president isn't going to make things better.""

""If we work together--""

""Do yourselves a favor and forget that stuff,"" I advised him. I shouldered the rest of gear and began to walk away, my footsteps echoing in the unnatural stillness of the world. ""Try to find some food and live the rest of your short lives trying not to be miserable. It's all anyone can do these days."" I ignored his calls to come back, and turned my attention the road. I still didn't know where I was going, but at least I was moving. That'll likely get me somewhere else, somewhere with maybe a little more hope.

Or maybe one day, I'll take a step, and then another, and another, and then just fall on the ground, stone dead. Whichever comes first.

"[WP] The armies of Hell are finally moving to take Earth, but are met by the superior militaries of the modern world.",SenorDangerwank,"The smell of sulfur filled my nose as we dove from the helicopters and set up a defensive perimeter around the landing zone.  There were eight choppers that needed to unload and only two could fit on the ledge at a time.  The Maw had a massive main entry, but over years other cracks had splintered open and then widened as demons sought to claw their way out.  It was one of these that we'd be using to get in.  

Gun blasts could be heard below us as the first clusters of demons began surfacing from the pit.  It wasn't until choppers five and six were landing that the first clambered its way out of the hole we'd be using to gain entry. 

Demons were generally the same shape and size, but each was subtly different.  They were scaled and had reverse joints on their powerful lower legs making them resemble a dinosaur.  Their arms were long and gangly but powerful, able to support their weight if they were sprinting on all fours but just as capable of strangling a man when they were on their hind legs.  They all had tails of varying lengths and their faces had protruding snouts like a snake but with a ring of bone-spikes protruding like a crown around their head.

Past that, variations began occurring.  They might stand anywhere from four to five feet.  Most had long claws on their hands and feet.  Their tails might be barbed, clawed, or even clubbed, though they generally were just used for balanced while running.  They ranged in color from a muddy brown to a dull orange, but most were a vibrant red like the one before us.

I unloaded two rounds from my M4A1 into it before it even saw us.  It sank to the ground and a deep purple blood oozed from the holes in its chest.  I had the gun set to semi-auto to conserve ammo as we had no idea how long we'd be under, but it could be set to full auto and I was sure we'd need it.  

Our last choppers were unloading by the time the second demon popped out to be blasted by the second member of my squad.  Until the going got really tough, we'd fire in rotation to save precious ammo.  We'd have a couple mobile containers with us that we called mules that would haul extra supplies, but they were slow and we might have to leave them behind at any point.  Below us, the trickle of demons had turned to a small stream.  The artillery would wait on us to get inside, but after that, they'd lay down a steady suppressing fire on the entrance until we came out.  

I leaned into my mic as the last chopper pulled away.  ""Ground command, we're going in.  We'll signal with the transmitter when we're ready to go.""

""Roger that,"" came the response call.  ""We'll keep the exit clear till you get back.  Give 'em hell.""

I smiled grimly at his choice of moniker and, signaling my squad, led the way into the pit.

We didn't know much but we expected any radio transmissions between us and outside world would cut out once we got inside.  Any UAVs we'd sent had lost contact as soon as they'd crossed the border.  If anyone made it back to the gate, every man that'd been sent in had with them a small radio transmitter that could be tossed out the gate to request a bombing run to clear the zone and then call in transport helicopters to get us out.  

The chamber we entered was empty and everyone stopped to stare for a second at the environment around us.  We were in a small cavern of deep red rock.  Through it ran rivulets of brimstone and bright lava that produced sufficient light to see by.  Our indicators showed the air was somehow breathable, albeit barely, but it stank of sulfur and I pulled up my ventilation mask.

""Radio check one two.  One two,"" I said into the mic.

""Reading you loud and clear on the local channel,"" came squad two's leader.  We'd separated ourselves into eight squads of eight.  It was a small enough force to penetrate the smaller entry but should still provide us with enough teams to cover our exits.  

There were two passages in front of us.  I mentally flipped a coin and decided on the left one.  ""Squads seven and eight, keep a mule and cover the right entrance.  Keep them off our backs.  We'll call if we need you.  Radio checks every one hundred meters.  Everyone else, with me.""

We pressed down the left passage, leap frogging between the rock outcroppings to provide cover as we progressed.  We'd equipped silencers to our rifles to limit the attention we attracted but we didn't run into anything immediately.  Soon enough though, we heard them.  It was the sound of a child's scream, but compressed and quieter.  A demon's cry still sent shivers up my spine even after all these years, and a group of them all sounding off together was the stuff of nightmares.

""Incoming.  Ready up.  Squad one, take point,"" I called out over the mic and my squad fanned out across the hallway.  Squad two took up position behind, ready to step up if need be.  The creatures rounded the corner, loping down the passage towards us.

""Fire.""  The first wave of demons tumbled down in spurts of thick, purple blood.  My squad knew how to differentiate their targets and no shot was wasted.  In seconds, twenty or more had fallen.  But there were more.  God dammit, there were always more and they rushed towards us.

As much as the wall of corpses helped to slow the attackers, it also provided a camouflaging shield from our bullets and shots started going astray.  After twenty shots I called out over the radio.  ""Squad one.  On my mark, drop back.  Squad two take point.""  I fired a couple extra shots that may or may not have hit.  ""Mark.""

Like clockwork, my teams slid between the gaps left for us by squad two and they started unloading into the demons.  So far none had even come close and it seemed like their numbers were finally starting to thin as we reloaded.  In conjunction with my thoughts, one leaped atop the pile of corpses and snapped his tail releasing a flurry of barbs towards us.  Two men sank down screaming, one clutching his arm and the other his gut.

Without me needing to issue the order, four members of squad three stepped up.  Two to recover the injured and two to fill the gaps.  It was over within seconds after that.  The hallway quieted and men reloaded as I saw to the injured.  Antiseptic was already being applied to first man's arm and it was being bandaged.  He looked shaken but fine.  The second man hadn't been so lucky.  The wounds on his stomach seemed minor, but the flesh around them was burned and he was exhibiting fever systems.  The men had started calling it flash fever when it had started popping up four years ago, and it was always fatal.

I took the man's hand as he lay on the ground shaking.  His injury had occurred just two minutes ago, but already his eyes were unfocused and he seemed to slip in and out of lucidity.  It would be over soon.  His hand suddenly squeezed mine and our eyes locked.  ""Sir,"" he spat out, his voice labored.  ""I'm sor-I'm sorry that...""

I squeezed his hand.  ""Listen to me.  You don't have anything to be sorry about.  You hear me?""  But it didn't matter.  He was already dead.  Even after all this time, it was never easy.  I stood up and spoke into the mic.  ""Squad Six, send a man up to replace Martin.  We'll  pick him up on the way back through if we can.""

We continued on in silence over the mass of bodies we'd left strewn across the hallway.  A creature stirred and a man from squad two crushed its skull with the butt of his gun.  We marched further into darkness.

"[WP] The armies of Hell are finally moving to take Earth, but are met by the superior militaries of the modern world.",SenorDangerwank,"The roar of helicopter blades and claps of thunder drowned out all other noises.  I sat in the crew compartment, my hands clutching a set of prayer beads, and I wasn't the only one.  The things had practically become standard issue since the apocalypse started.  I guess everyone figured that if Satan had unleashed his forces on the world, chances were there was another guy upstairs watching it all go down.  If everything went according to plan, I'd be going to meet him today.  Not yet though.  There was still work to do.

""Chopper unit, you got hostiles approaching your position.""  The voice crackled through my headset.

""Roger that Command.  Releasing drone deterrent,"" came the response from our pilot.  

I couldn't see it from where I sat even if it hadn't been raining, but I knew what it looked like.  Dozens of drones would peel away from the outside of the craft, supported in the air by eight motors and mounted with two automated anti-personnel turrets.  They would form up roughly in a sphere around the aircraft and engage any hostiles that came too close.  Before this had all started, there was concern over the auto-targeting system picking up friendlies, but setting their targeting parameters to the Gargoyles had proven easy.  

Gargoyles, or Gargs as the boys called them, were your typical, run-of-the-mill flying demons.  Their wings began at the top of their tail and ran up to appendages on the tips of their ""arms"".  Gargs couldn't hurt you unless they reached you, but they were strong.  They could rip apart the titanium alloy off a fighter jet if they caught one and had no problem dismantling a man.  

They'd been a real problem back in the day for helicopters carrying personnel.  They weren't nearly fast enough to catch a jet most times, but neither could a jet engage them.  They hadn't been built to take down dozens of organic threats that could alter their trajectory in the air on a whim.  Helicopters had initially relied on mounted weapons and door gunners for defense, but all it took was letting one through and it would bring you down.  The military had already started providing drone support to aircraft before Geneva had gotten around to ratifying it.  

The rain slackened for an instant and I stole a glance out the window.  The weather had gotten a lot more unpredictable, but here it always stormed.  Below me, the Maw lit the entire place with a red glow.  The Maw is where it had all started.  Eight years ago, the ground in Eastern Europe had torn open and Hell had poured out of it.  It had been a massacre in the surrounding countries.  Ukraine.  Belarus.  Poland.  For a bit there, it really had felt like the end of the world.

Lucky for us, the demons hit Russia to the East and, like so many before them, had a lot more trouble there than they thought they would.  Although it had crippled them, Moscow'd held them off long enough for the world to make a coordinated response.  Western Europe assembled their armies en masse and the good old US of A had been able to reinforce their bases across Europe and the Middle East.  China and India had risen up like a pair of lions, reinforcing Russia and going so far as to push the demons back towards their hellhole.  

Things got worse though before they got better.  The first couple of years showed us how unprepared we were to handle a threat like this.  For the most part, the demons were savage animals.  They were vicious and had no problem killing a single man, but they weren't intelligent.  A platoon of prepared infantry could cut through the same amount of demons with ease but battles were never that even.  There were just so damned many of the bastards, it never seemed like you could kill enough of them to make a difference.

Then there were the big ones.  Satan's lieutenants or whatever.  The biggest one I ever saw stood near sixty feet and wielded a blade of pure fire that cut through tank armor like butter.  The worst of it though was that they could direct the demonic hordes through sheer will alone making ground combat a nightmare.  It had taken laser directed Hellfire Missile (ironic, I know) to kill that bastard.  Most went down a little easier, but not by much.

Other holes had started tearing open too.  Don't know if Satan had thought the big one would be enough or was just waiting on the other ones to see what we would do.  Either way, holes started popping up all over the place and much needed reinforcements around the Maw were pulled back to protect their homes.  That had been the lowest point.  Almost every battle was lost, civilian casualties were innumerable, and South America and Africa had been reduced to areas of pocket resistance only.  

Then technology had caught up and we finally realized how to fight the damn things.  And from the ass-backwards fields of South Dakota, he appeared.  Major General Trenton Hunter, and he lived up to the name.  Proving just as much diplomat as politician, he'd only taken a year to develop and propose an international response plan to the situation, establish a united military front, and get himself ""elected"" to lead it, becoming Grand Marshall Trenton Hunter.  

That had been five years ago and it had been the turning point.  Global response forces had been organized to neutralize emerging holes and choke points had been established to contain regions already lost.  The best and brightest had been brought on board to develop technologies to address the threat and bring substandard military equipment up to snuff.  Hunter took the scattered mess the world military had been and forged it into the well-oiled machine he'd need to win the war.

That had been five years ago though and the world was getting tired.  The demons had long since fought to a standstill but the drain on human life was tremendous and although I was sure we'd killed billions of demons by now, they kept coming.  The conflict needed to be resolved or we'd lose through attrition and it would have all been for nothing, and Hunter knew it.  That was how I'd ended up here.

"[WP] The armies of Hell are finally moving to take Earth, but are met by the superior militaries of the modern world.",SenorDangerwank,"We'd been flown to a military base in Texas to attend a top secret meeting with Grand Marshall Trenton Hunter.  It was the first time I'd ever seen him in person.  He held the look of a career military man.  He kept his hair, now silver grey, in the style of a crew cut like his men and probably hadn't had it any other way in forty years.  His physique spoke to a well-disciplined fitness routine that had begun in his youth and continued to this day.  His uniform was ironed to perfection and his medals were arranged neatly on his chest.  He wasn't the most attractive man, but he had a certain air about him.  The kind of man you didn't mind lending your ear to.

""Lads,"" he said.  ""I don't mean to alarm you all, but it seems like we have a bit of a demon problem outside.""  There were chuckles around the room.  No need for grand prose and exalted image here.  Every man in the room was a veteran of at least a dozen combat missions since Doomsday and some of them had at least a dozen more before that.  Not to brag, but we were the best of the best.

""Jokes aside,"" he continued more somberly, ""it's time to put an end to this war before it scrapes us down to nothing.  The world can't take another five years of this, and for whatever it's worth, our military intelligence says that the rate that the demons are pouring out of the Maw indicates that they won't suffer the same problem as us in the foreseeable future.""  Curses sounded quietly throughout the room.  

""That's why you're here,"" he said.  ""We've been fighting this battle on our turf too long.  It's high time we brought the battle to them. It's time for us to venture down into the pit and drag out the worthless, sorry, sack of shit himself.""

""You mean the Devil,"" someone interrupted.

""I do,"" he responded and paused to let it sink in.  ""Now, I can't tell you at all what to expect.  Every demon we've been able to interrogate has confirmed he's leading the assault from there but none have been able to provide us with a layout or a size or anything.  Our researchers have confirmed that the Earth's core could not hold the amount of demons that have come out of the gates thus far, so it's likely the Maw leads to a pocket dimension of sorts...""

He paused and took a drink of water as he searched for words.  ""Eight years ago,"" he continued slowly, his eyes gazing off as thoughts of a simpler past came back to him.  ""If someone had approached me with that notion, I would have called him crazy and had him locked up.""  He took another drink of water.

""But things, as you know, are different now.  We're contending with forces we don't understand and it's through sheer human tenacity that we've come as far as we have.  If we cut the head off the snake, we don't know what will happen.  Our best guess is that the forces of Hell will lose direction and run amok and the rest of the war will be a mop up.  I like to hold the hope that the doors to Hell will slam shut...""

He paused again and looked around the room.  At us.  ""Which brings us to your role.  Not a soul here hasn't lost something in this war.  Family.  Friends.  And even still, you've given the past eight years of your life to this struggle.  You've given more than you should have ever had to.  And it's not right, but I'm asking you for more.  I'm asking you to go into the pit to try to end this."" He stopped for a minute, seeming to work up the effort to continue.  The room sat in respectful silence.

""As I've said, we don't know what you're walking into or what will happen,"" he continued finally.  ""I have to be completely honest with you.  Even assuming your mission is a success, the chance of anyone returning is slim.  If the Maw does slam shut when he dies..."" The rest of the thought didn't need to be spoken and Hunter looked to be struggling with what to say next.

""Sir,"" I said standing and interrupting his reflection.  ""I think I speak for every man here when I say it would be an honor.  If there's something we can do that might put an end to this then I volunteer, no matter the consequences.""

Every man in the room rose with me and we all stood at perfect attention.  Hunter gazed back at us, his eyes brimming with proud tears.  Then, he snapped a salute that would have made a drill sergeant happy. ""The honor is mine to have had the opportunity to serve with you.  Thank you.""  We returned the salute smartly and filed out of the room in silence to prepare.  There wasn't anything else to say.

I was brought out of my reverie by the shriek of a Garg as it was ripped apart by a drone.  I kissed my prayer beads and put them in my pocket with a picture of my wife and son.  You wouldn't have known there was a fire fight going on outside by the look of the men sitting around me.  They all carried an expression of grim acceptance for what lay ahead.  Sure, it was likely that none of us were coming back from this one, but for us, that just made it the same as any other assignment.

I stole a glance out the window and saw another Garg get ripped apart.  I wasn't really worried about us getting taking down as we flew around of the Maw.  The drone tech had been quickly perfected in this bloody crucible and it was unusual for anything to make it past them anymore.

I heard a squadron of our birds zip by us overhead and unload to clear out the skies a bit.  It wasn't likely see any Gargs that high and they could never catch a plane at speed, but there was always the risk of hitting one.  There were other monsters up there though.  Massive creatures that could only be dragons.  They proved not to be too much of an issue with air support however.  There were stories of sword spears taking the damn things down in the middle ages and they fared far worse against Sidewinder missiles. 

""Skies are as clear as they're going to be,"" came the sound of the fighter squadron leader's voice over the mic.

""You heard him Bravo Squadron,"" said Trenton Hunter himself from command.  ""Light the bastards up.""

We couldn't hear the B-52s fly over but we sure heard their payload.  Explosions rattled the helicopter as the area around the Maw was blasted into dust.  Thousands of demons shrieked as they were blown to kingdom come.  Even as far out as we were, the heat wave reached us.

Next came the ground assault, the tanks leading the charge through the only un-charred avenue to the Maw.  Clusters of demons that had escaped the initial carnage were blasted by explosive rounds.  Any that tried to attack the armor were ripped apart by the surrounding infantry and their drone escort.  It was a slaughter to the massive stone ramp that led down into the glowing red opening of the Maw.  Fortifications went up quickly as artillery was set in place to massacre the demons that would begin pouring out of that opening.  Anything left in the skies was cleared away and attack helicopter took up station above the gate ready to rain death on anything that tried to escape.

A deceptive calm took that place like I'd never witnessed before.  But it was just the calm before the storm.  We'd poked the hornet's nest and there would be ramifications.  ""Alpha Squad,"" came Hunter's voice over the mics.  ""You're up.  Good luck in there boys, and Godspeed.""  In front of our accelerating helicopters, the gates of Hell beckoned us.",poop314

"[WP] The armies of Hell are finally moving to take Earth, but are met by the superior militaries of the modern world.",SenorDangerwank,"I don’t quite know how these things were still alive by this point, but most did eventually die after 10 minutes of agony with their body entirely broken. Tortured.
 
I don’t get it.
 
I still don’t quite understand why we had to fight these things at all. The papers, the president, and so on, claimed the things had declared war. They called them “demons”, they said they were from “hell”. They never talked though. Never uttered a word. How could they declare war? For the most part they were not aggressive. They would fight if provoked. We just had the line repeatedly that they were just useless soldiers, and that useless soldiers get shot just as hard as great ones.
 
Like I said though, you put it out of your mind. Your mindset when you’re in the field, away from home, your whole minute to minute, 24 hour life, revolving around this war or that war. You forget who you are. You think and do things that later when back in your home you wonder what the fuck you were thinking. So it’s no different here. My reservations, my moral qualms, came after. When I thought back, and I wondered, had any of the demons ever tried to attack us? I didn’t want to answer it, though I knew full well what the answer was.
 
Heaven, hell, demons, angels. Seems obvious now, but back then we didn’t realise how much we were assuming. Their motives, actions, even what they are and do and where they’re from. They didn’t tell us, and the united states is mostly Christian, so we assumed. We fought and tortured these things on assumptions and fear.   Of course in other parts of the world they did the same thing. But in the middle east muslims thought of them as genies, or “djinn” as it’s spelled.  And so the motives and actions of the middle east “demons” were very different to the U.S. assumptions.  They were the same damn things. It seems crazy now. War makes rational logical people crazy though. Worldwide panic is as impossible to stop and control, as a wave rushing fast through the waters. We panicked. Was it Churchill who said, individuals are intelligent, a group of people are stupid? Something to that effect.  Entire countries of people? Panic becomes a force of nature. The only way to stop it was to kill these things.  It was very black and white. No debate over what to do particularly. Unanimous agreement by all congressmen and senators, to put soldiers on every street in America.
 
See these so called “demons” appeared almost out of nowhere it seemed.  Nobody ever seemed to actually see their appearance.  You’d just turn around and they were standing there. I don’t get how nobody ever saw one arriving. Maybe they hid well. Who knows, since they never talked to us.
 
The drill was when we saw one just popping up somewhere, like in front of a bar, or in a park, or by a row of houses with kids riding their bikes outside, was to immediately clear the area and destroy the target quickly. Took 10 minutes or so. We took the body away for whatever experiments the scientists were doing. Back to normal.
 
It’s dumb, that I never thought about the fact they didn’t attack us. They just showed up, and were dead 10 minutes later. If this was genuinely an invasion, they were doing it as awfully as you could imagine. They never appeared in groups, never seemed to attack anyone, died quickly. The only other thing they did, before we started killing them, was take a huge interest in people. They seem to find us fascinating, and would walk up to people and start looking at their face as if analysing it. They tried to avoid touching people. It happened accidentally on occasion. But they seemed to be aware of the risk, and deliberately avoided doing it.
 
It was crazy. Crazy crazy fucking crazy. And we all fell for it. We all believed it.  Now of course there’s people and groups popping up pointing out all these moral issues and genuinely baffling choices that were made. These people and groups do little to change opinion, and seem to get associated with environmental and animal welfare groups, which makes people unfortunately ignore them somewhat.
They don’t know, though. About the guns. Nobody really saw the death. They’d all cleared out of the area before we engaged the target.  They argue about it being cruel, about the war making no sense. And that’s without knowing what it’s like to watch that torture daily. To have to drag their destroyed crippled corpse to the truck. They don’t know. They don’t get the nightmares.
 
I’ve told you too much already. I try to avoid it. I get way too emotional, too distressed, at what I am, what I’ve done, and the old line people used about Nazis almost tongue in cheek at times, that they were “just following orders”. So was I.  They commited genocide.
 
So did I.",thecavernrocks
"[WP] The armies of Hell are finally moving to take Earth, but are met by the superior militaries of the modern world.",SenorDangerwank,"Two hour later found us a kilometer further into the pit.  Three more clashes had left us eight men fewer.  Two more from barbs and six from squad four when they'd gotten jumped from a hidden channel in the wall.  Luckily, it had been a small group or we might have lost them all.  Demons were generally trivial when engaged at a range, but in hand-to-hand combat, they were vicious and laying down supporting fire was impossible once they'd engaged.

Out of a jagged crack in the stonework in front of us came the cries of thousands of demons.  I signaled for silence among the men following and clambered up the uneven rock face into the crack.  The stone was rough and provided easy handholds, but puddles and tiny streams of lava made the climb treacherous.  Finally, I reached a gap at the top and scrambled through onto a small ledge that overlooked a massive chamber.

The space I was in could have held multiple football stadiums.  Immediately in front of me was a sheer drop down to a vast lake of lava and beyond that lay the personification of horror.  Thousands upon thousands of demons tore through the space towards a massive archway lit by a red glow that I could only assume was the entrance to the Maw.  Above them flew flocks of gargoyles and before my eyes, a dragon clawed its massive bulk across the ceiling and dove through the gate.

Directing the flood was a massive demon.  Twin horns sprouted from his pale head and his eyes were pools of blackness.  He wore mismatched plates of armor over his massive girth and he was supported on six ashen grey legs that grew at varying lengths from his strangely stretched torso.  In his hands, he held an enormous silver spear.  The figure behind him though was what drew my attention.

Satan, I had no doubt that's who it was, sat observing the chaos from a massive throne suspended over the pool of lava.  Rams horns curled around his face and bright yellow eyes and fangs interrupted the visage that was otherwise all too human.  Four web wings protruded from the red-tinted skin of his back and draped over the throne.  He would have been at least sixty feet tall standing and he took no pains to cover his seemingly perfect form.  Against the chair leaned an obsidian blade that seemed to pull the light from around the room.  

The most telling sign though was the atmosphere of terror that emanated from him.  My mind raced back to a memory of when I had gone rock climbing when I was younger.  I'd climbed up the rock face just fine but couldn't find my foothold on the way down and had taken my hand off the wall to lean down to look.  I felt myself start to slip and had reached up to grab the wall with my left hand and found nothing but air.  The surge of fear in that instant had been like nothing I'd felt before.  The adrenaline had surged so strongly through me that my hands had hurt.

It was just like that, but without end.  Not the building fear of combat that I'd learned to suppress and use, but a primal fear.  One that hearkened back to a time when man had to hunt creatures that could just as easily bat aside his spear and kill him.  The fear curled painfully through my chest and I felt my muscles spasm involuntarily. A wave of dizziness washed over me and I squeezed my eyes shut and forced myself to breathe steadily.

It took a minute, but the feeling slowly passed.  I painfully unclenched my fists and looked out over the cavern again.  Satan was still there, but it wasn't so bad this time.  I could control it.

As clarity returned to me, I noticed a small group of demons, maybe fifty, as they were forced away from the main stampede and pushed into a side passage on the opposite side of the chamber.  I clambered back through the crack and radio-ed the men at the bottom.  ""Boys, we might have incoming.  Get ready.""

Sure enough, the demons sprinted into our trap and were mowed down in seconds.  From my vantage point, I'd been able to place clean shots even after the wave of bodies had choked the corridor.  I finished climbing down and called out to the squad leaders to join me and relayed a message over the radio for the other teams to bring the extra mule and join us.  After everyone had arrived, I laid out my plan.",poop314
"[WP] The armies of Hell are finally moving to take Earth, but are met by the superior militaries of the modern world.",SenorDangerwank,"I waited in front of the side entrance to the main chamber with fifty of the men that were left.  Leading the way were the two mules which had been mounted with heavy machine guns.  The remaining squads were arrayed out behind them.  

I turned to the men around me.  ""Now, when you see him, your body is going to want to curl up into a ball and you won't want to do anything but let them take you.  Don't give in to it.  If you do, I'll have to do the rest by myself and they don't pay me enough for that.""  The men around me laughed.  It wasn't great as far as jokes went, but it was probably the last one they'd ever hear.

""Alright,"" I said into the radio.  ""Charlie, you have a go.""  There was a quiet second of anticipation and then the sound of of explosions tore through the air and dust washed into the chamber where we waited.  ""Ready!  Forward!"" I shouted over the thunder of falling stone.  As fast as the mules would allow us, we plowed into the chamber.

Three LRAC F1 rocket launchers had collapsed the tunnel that the demons were pouring out  of leaving us only the ones in the chamber to contend with.  That was still in excess of a thousand plus the large demon and the Devil himself, but they were the best odds we were going to get.  We didn't have much time either.  I'd seen these demons tunnel through the earth with just the use of their hands at blinding speeds and that cave in wouldn't hold them back for long.

Satan rose from his throne as we entered the chamber and looked at us.  If he was surprised, his face didn't betray it.  The men quailed as I expected but I had purposefully manned one of the mounted guns and the roar of two thousand rounds per minute pulled them out of their stupor.  The Vulcan was fed from out of the mule and the ammo wouldn't last long, but when you were firing over thirty-three rounds a second and you couldn't miss, that was plenty.

The second Vulcan roared to life beside me and the demons were cut to ribbons around us.  Anything that was missed in the comb of bullets was quickly brought down by the supporting infantry.  The smaller demons didn't stand a chance.

Even still, screams began as the recovering Gargs swooped down and pulled men up to the ceiling of the chamber where they were dismembered and dropped.  Most of them were shot down, but not all and anyone we lost made our gambit infinitely harder.  As if to spite us, Satan settled back on his throne to watch the display before him.  In the meantime, his lieutenant unleashed an earsplitting cry and charged.

I couldn't turn the Vulcan on him.  The rounds were two small to make enough of a difference and if any reflected back at us off his armor plating, we'd be done.  I had to trust the men around me to keep him distracted while I managed the smaller ones.

As I'd thought he might, he charged over the ranks of smaller creatures not caring a whit what happened to them as they were trampled under his feet.  My co-gunner and I split the remaining demons on either side of the lieutenant, keeping them suppressed and allowing the infantry to fan out behind us.  Snipers kept the Gargs off of them while they peppered the charging behemoth where his flesh was exposed.  

He'd almost reached the mules when a barrage of bullets from his left impacted his face and he spun towards them blindly swinging his spear in an arc.  Men tried to jump under the blade, but some were too slow and were torn asunder.  The men to his right responded with a barrage of their own and he spun back in their direction, but his swing was completely off.  He'd been completely blinded.  

""Charlie, how's it looking?"" I screamed into the radio.

""Just one more...we're a go!""

""Down!"" I yelled over the main channel and crouched behind the mule as men dove for cover around me.  The rocket impacted at the top of the creature's spine and his brains were blown across the room.  His headless body collapsed to the floor crushing a number of demons as they were reforming, taking advantage of the brief stretch without a hail of bullets.

""Fire!"" I shouted over the channel, but I didn't need to.  Men were already clambering back to their feet, reforming ranks behind the mules and unloading on the demons.  We'd killed maybe two thirds of them, but there were still hundreds and we needed to get further into the room.  Just then, the Vulcan clicked empty.  A few seconds later, the other did too.

The demons shrieked with excitement and surged towards us.  Our fire slowed as clips needed to be changed out.  Some men had their sidearms out and were firing shot after shot into the frenzy, but it wasn't enough.  A few seconds later, the demons poured over us.

Many of the men were ripped apart in the first wave.  Those of use that weren't formed what groups we could and met them back to back with our comrades.  I was with two others, our backs to the mule.  I tossed them each a fresh clip and we lit into the demons around us.  Still, the mules plodded forward, every so slowly.  

We were the only three left by the time we finally reached the center of the chamber.  The demons were circled around us waiting for an opening and they got it when one of the guns clicked empty.  The other two soon followed.  We whipped out our combats knives, but it was a useless gesture.  The men alongside me were pulled into the mass and torn apart. 

I spun and my knife cut across a demon's face and it shrieked.  Then pain flashed through my leg as another gouged into my hamstring.  I spun and buried the knife in its eye but it was jerked from my grasp as the creature spasmed away.  Another demon tackled me backwards and its claws tore into my gut.  As it reared back, I closed my eyes and waited for the end to come.

But it didn't.  I opened my eyes to see the creatures surrounding me in a circle.  Behind them, the Devil had risen to his feet and was approaching.

I could feel my body dying already.  It would be over soon whether the Devil ended it or not.  I reached into my pocket, brushed aside the prayer beads, and pulled out the picture of my wife and daughter.  Clare had been wearing that blue dress with the white bow that Sandra and I had picked out for her.  I closed my eyes and could hear her voice echoing in my head.

""You'll come soon and visit, right?"" she'd asked.

""Of course I will pumpkin.""

""Promise?""

""I promise,"" I'd said.  

But I hadn't been able to keep that promise.  She'd been visiting her grandmother in Poland when the Maw opened.  I'd never spoken to her again.

""Don't worry Pumpkin,"" I said, the air escaping from my lips painfully.  ""Daddy's coming to see you soon.""

A voice sounded in my earpiece.  ""Sir, I almost have the shot.  He's just got to get a little closer.""

Satan finally reached me and leaned over.  His voice was velvet and all I wanted was to sink into the comfort it promised.  But it was a lie and I would never give him that pleasure.  ""A grand gesture but in one vain I think.""

""It's away!"" came the voice over my earpiece and I heard a *whoosh* as the rocket was expelled from the launcher.  In an instant, Satan spun, his sword cutting through the air and the rocket was shorn in half.  His wings enclosed around him, protecting him from the explosion and redirecting it at the hordes standing around him.

He smiled and turned back to me.  ""What that your plan?  Your final gambit?  Did you ever really think it would work?""

I laughed and specks of blood flew from my lips.  ""I was hoping, but I had something else in mind just in case.""  With a final burst of strength, I pulled the detonator from my pocket and flipped the switch.  The split second of terror I saw painted across that bastard's face made every second worth it.  Then the explosives in the mule ripped through the cavern and the world went black.",poop314

"[WP] The armies of Hell are finally moving to take Earth, but are met by the superior militaries of the modern world.",SenorDangerwank,"People didn’t know what they were at first.  They started appearing one October, which made people just assume they were wearing impressive costumes for halloween.  They got selfies with them. They didn’t have any idea what risk they were taking by nearly touching them. Of course now we know what happens if you touch one.  It’s crazy to think people almost did this freely.  You know, touching them, guaranteeing a lock on their soul, that made it sure thing, that they’d end up in hell.
 
It seems crazy now but hindsight makes everyone wise, I guess.  I don’t really think about it too much.  I just know they’re a target, and I have orders to eliminate them. I don’t think of them as living, even. They technically aren’t “alive”, and can’t be killed as such. I have a gun, I have a sergeant, who similarly detaches himself from thoughts of the enemy. He’d done tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. He always teaches us, to not think of any target as human. Don’t think about their families, don’t think about the funeral that’ll come afterward.  They are grey blank targets, that are no more deserving of life than our targets we shot in training simulations.
 
But those people he shot in the middle east, WERE human. These new things, literally not human, with no moral qualms over killing them, no reports of brutality, of treating the enemy poorly. Because everybody agreed, we need to get these things dead. Brutality was encouraged whole heartedly. I’d never seen the devil sign the geneva convention. We went all out. Used weapons that officially didn’t exist, that we would freely carry around in public areas and use if necessary, but officially we weren’t allowed to talk about them, because they were cruel. The geneva convention was thrown out the window with these weapons. Funny that we immediately had them.  But of course the line was they weren’t being developed before this whole fucked up thing. The military is sneaky. I still love it. The comradery. I love my country. I love my fellow soldiers. I love the shiity bunks we sleep in and the tiny room that quickly fills with a deadly gas of farts.
 
Deadly gas.  These mystery weapons had that.  If they existed, of course. I’m speaking about this with a lot of guesses, you understand. Educated guesses since I used the weapon and was taught thoroughly how it worked and every nut and bolt in the thing was imprinted on my memory. But the gas. Who knows. All I can tell you is what I know. This gas is like mustard gas, times a thousand. This stuff is deadlier than bullets. It seemed to affect these creatures more than humans, but we were still strictly forbidden to fire them in an area that hadn’t been cleared of people yet. That wasn’t hard, since people run a mile when they see one of these fuckers.
 
Again, you can’t exactly kill one of these things, but you can destroy the body they currently inhabit. I guess since this whole thing proved God and souls exist, that killing a human is pretty much the same.
 
Either way lets call it killing. And this gas, it killed them. Cruely. I have my suspicions that it was deliberately created to be slow, excrutiatingly painful, and essentially a scare tactic more than anything else.  Because it froze them in place first.  That’s the paralysis effect. Then their skin. Well, let’s just say it reminded me of peeling an orange. It always fascinated me that when all their skin had fallen off onto the floor, that their muscles underneath looked pretty much exactly like those pictures you see in textbooks of a man without skin, to show muscle structure and what not. I did think sometimes, are these things like us? Were they former humans? But like I say, you put it out of your mind and move on with your life. Bury it somewhere in your memory. Hope it doesn’t find it’s way out briefly. Hope it doesn’t ruin your day with an existential crisis of morality, of wondering what you are, what you want to be, what you’ve done that can’t be forgiven. They call it PTSD and give us pills for it. But it did seem like a lot of soldiers felt like me. Somehow killing them was a lot harder to deal with than actual humans. Why? Was it just coincidence, or some kind of weird power? 
This gas.  See every time I think about it my mind wanders onto questions of morals. Because why in the fuck would you make a weapon deliberately cruel and create slow painful deaths? We joke sometimes that our generals are sociopaths. But it’s friendly joking after a PT session and we are just laying about bored. We support our generals whole heartedly.
 
But still, they signed off on this. Before the things came. And on a gigantic scale, since every troop in every branch of the military, navy, marines, army, national guard even, had one of these. They’d been manufacturing them for years. 
The gas was shot in little pellets.  Aim for the target, the pellet shoots at their direction, opening it’s payload upon contact or when it hits the floor. It sticks though. Most of the time we managed to shoot accurately enough to get it to hit them. It sticks on them. So at this point, paralysed, skin sloughed onto the floor like some kind of weird dressing gown. I think the next bit is the worst, personally. It starts choking you. It affects your throat muscles, tightening them. You very nearly cannot breathe. You can breathe just enough to stay alive and have to live a few minutes longer while feeling like you’re choking so much that you should die instantly. But you don’t. It drags out on and on. 
 
See, I nearly got swept away by a current in the ocean, when I was swimming on a day out to the beach with my family. I could have died. I started to drown. By this point so far away from the coast nobody could save me surely. Especially as most people don’t recognise drowning. What it looks like. But some guy, on a body board. He appeared out of nowhere, took me back to the beach, swimming along dragging the body board with me on top. I thanked him. He disappeared after. Couldn’t see him. I never really thought about it until the things came, and wondered if he was some kind of angel. Now we have proof they exist you see.
But the choking part was always the worst to me, for that. The cruellest part.
The next part was horrifying also. Muscles, in all animals, have more strength than you could imagine. You never usually see the maximum strength of muscles. Every so often though, you hear a story of a mother lifting her car up to save her baby. You hear of a person trapped in some way suddenly developing massive strength. Was it adrenaline or something? I don’t know. But either way, if your body uses the maximum strength of your muscles, it essentially breaks everything. Bones, tendons. The heart, being a muscle, can go crazy too. This part of the gas murder, it made the muscles reach their maximum strength. All of them at once. Everything tensing and tugging. Every bone broken and fractured. Fractures breaking off, sticking into tissue, everywhere.

"[WP]""We've all heard the stories, but we had never expected it to be like this""",TheEmeraldMoose,"We’ve all heard the stories, but we had never expected it to be like this.

I stare at the filthy street before me. It is not paved with cobblestones, as I am used to, but simply hard-packed dirt. After the recent rain, a few muddy puddles still linger in low spots along the walls of the houses—if you could call them houses—that butt right up against the street. The shabby buildings, so close together, block out all but the most meager sunlight. A few beggars sit in doorways, their rags barely distinguishable from the faded wood and street muck.

My maid, Gemma, offers me a hand as I step carefully down from my carriage. As a lady, I’ve never ventured into the lower city before. The place is full of pickpockets and worse, I’ve often been warned. If my father knew I was here now, he’d surely give me a lecture to rival the one I’d had the last time I’d complained of my corset. We talk of the poverty, of course, and everyone knows there are those without enough to eat, but seeing it is another matter entirely.

I am only here now because of Gemma. She’s been working for me nearly two years, after being hired as a kitchen maid. I knew she came from the lower city, but she rarely spoke of home. She is the picture of propriety, speaking when spoken to, smiling demurely, speaking to me warmly but never too familiarly, less I think her forward. It had been quite a shock a few days earlier to find her sobbing quietly as she tidied my chambers. She’d tried to brush away my questions as she wiped her tearstained face, but eventually she’d confided that her younger sister, always sickly, was now dangerously ill, and even with her wages, her family had too little for even the most basic of healers.

There was only one thing to do, really. Gemma had been a companion to me, for all she tried to keep a proper distance. It was something that cost me so little. The family would join her in the manor, of course. It was my hope that we could find a healer in time—Father knew several with more than a bit of skill—but if not, at least her sister would live her last days comfortably, and close to those she loved. I could have sent Gemma to fetch them alone, but I felt it right that I be there to help. And, to be truly honest with myself, I was curious.

Gemma leads me into the house. As my eyes adjust to the dim light, I look around the room in shock. The street was nothing compared to this. The house has but one room, with one small window for light. A rickety table sits in the center, beside of soot-blackened stove. The sick sister, Britta, lies in a sagging iron bed in the far corner. A young boy sits on the floor, playing with a small wooden figure. There is another young woman seated at the table. She jumps to her feet when we enter. This must be Mara, a few years younger than Gemma, and a seamstress, if I remember correctly. She curtsies to me, and I nod.

*****

I stare at the lady who’s just come into the house with Gemma. She wears a gown of finest silk, trimmed with embroidery even I’d be hard-put to craft, and me being the best seamstress in the lower city, folk all say.

“Erran, stand for the lady,” I hiss at my brother.

He does, and tries to bow, for all he ain’t learned how. Erran’s only seven, and while he earns a few coins running messages for folk, proper manners are still a bit beyond him.

“There’s no need,” the lady says kindly.

Lady Sarra, is what Gemma calls her. Always says she’s real nice, but it’s more than nice letting us come up to the manor. I knew Gemma did good work, but this is past what we could expect, and I’m that grateful for it.

Britta’s too sick to stand, but Lady Sarra don’t seem to mind. She has her man, a big fellow, take Britta out to the carriage. Poor girl’s half asleep as he does it. At least she’ll be more comfortable where we were bound.

We’ve packed our things already, what little there is to take. Gemma helps me take the carpet bags, and Erran hurries behind with his little basket. The carriage is large, large enough for Britta to lay on one bench with her head in my lap while Gemma and Erran share the other with Lady Sarra. It’s uncomfortable, sitting in front of the lady, but she’s still smiling. I remind myself she’s doing this herself. Erran, who ain’t got much sense yet in that way, talks the lady’s ear off the whole ride. I try to hush him, but she’s laughing, so I keep quiet.

It’s scant minutes before we’re at the manor, that what’s near a half hour’s walk. The driver opens the door, and we climb out. I clamp my mouth shut to keep my jaw from dropping. I ain’t never seen nothing so clean. I’ve done my share of work for rich folks, even in the finer parts of the city, but this is different. The pale bricks practically shine at me as we go in.

The inside’s more shocking than the outside. Shining wood floors, light streaming in through big windows—glass windows!—and curtains and rugs and tapestries all hung over everything. I try real hard not to gawp as bad as Erran, but I know my eyes are wide as saucers. Gemma tells us how it is, when she visits on her day off, but her tales don’t do it justice.

""One question. Which one of you here believes in the Batman?"" 
As he finished uttering those words, the crowd watching him all raised their hands in unison. 
""HA!"" His laugh paraded the streets, echoing and reverberating off of the town hall and surrounding homes. The flock of people stay silent, listening and sinking the haunting laugh into themselves. One member was brave enough to raise his hand and ask the Joker a question. 
""Why should we believe a maniac like you?""
 ""Believe me because I'm the only one sane enough to realise the truth, now isn't that ironic? You're all deluded. Lost sheep. Like the old me. I wish he existed too. But NEWS FLASH, he doesn't. Are you all happy now?""
""Shut it Joker, just stop talking."" 
""You'd like that, wouldn't you? That's why I am going to keep talking until my last breath. Don't worry, you will have your silence soon enough.""
""Just die already you freak"" One individual from the crowd shouted. The rest of the crowd began shouting this in sync, The Joker becoming ever more frustrated. 
""You all think I am kidding? I mean that was my career in crime, my stamp on terror? I guess that's correct. You will all see soon enough. Nothing but evil exists in this world, you don't get your superheroes, your caped crusaders. The Dark Knight is an extension of me, not a physical entity to save you. Bye Gotham, my beautiful playground."" 
The crowd gasped as the Joker began to cough up blood, the wound in his side seeping blood. He knelt on the ground, laughing the whole time. Laughing until the final essence of his life faded away. As his life faded, he stared at the symbol in the sky, now fading, Batman's calling. That beacon of hope died in the sky, and with it, the part of the city that kept everyone going. Hope.

  Drinking, slurping, eating. Bats. Mice, really? Rats. The beverage above, had some water in it's formula, if you were wondering about the nature portion of the analogy. Dancing that thought away, I can't help but wonder if times would be easier in the days that the monarchy would pay a jester or writer to do his doing in honor of the noble.

  Maybe aquaman is hiring. Inventing, was it? I didn't. Not really. But I did convince them. The world. You. That the Batman existed. Shadows before then, yeah? Shadows creeping around, with just one bright light in the corner of the room.

[EU] The greatest trick the Joker ever pulled was convincing the world Batman existed.,The_Evil_Within,"The door slammed shut after them. He and the wardens were on their way to see the big guy. The boss of bosses. The chief executive. 

He'd been in many prisons, but this was the final one. 

The one no one could ever run away from. The one where the wardens had red skin. And horns. And tails.

This was it. He had been here for over two years, human time. Time mattered less aound here, since everybody had plenty of it, but he still kept track of it. 
And every day for two years now, one thought had been torturing him. Giving him no rest. Corroding his brain.

He needed to tell someone. And there was only one person in the world who was worthy of his confession.

It wasn't his conscience that made him do it. His conscience was long gone. All that went away when he fell into that tank full of mutagenic chemicals, when he became the monster he was now. All that was human in him had disappeared that same day.

On earth, there was no longer a Joker. And it seemed, no one even remembered him. He sometimes wondered if anyone would have come to his funeral. Not because he cared, but because of the absurdity of such a question. 

It was purely hypothetical of course. There had been no funeral, owing to the gruesome nature of his death. There had been no corpse left to bury.

---

The wardens followed him silently through the long corridor that apparently lead to the CEO's office. His wardens were no ordinary guards, they were the toughest. No one had told him but he knew he was a maximum security prisoner. Maybe that wasn't so strange, given what he had done when he was alive. He did have an impressive track record. This was probably why the big guy had agreed to see him. It was a rare honor to be given some of the CEO's time, he was aware of that.

They arrived to the office and the wardens told the office guards their business. Then they were shown to a waiting room. After some time one of the office guards came out and said ""Mr Lucifer will see you now, sir"". 

Even for a man like the Joker, this was a bit surreal.

In the CEO's room, a man in a black suit behind a large desk greeted him and asked him to sit down. The man looked calm and attentive, almost friendly. He introduced himself as H.I.M Lucifer, in charge of operations. He also said it was uncommon for him to talk to the inmates directly. He usually delegated that to his staff. But, he said, he had understood the Joker had something important to tell him.

Then he said ""The talk we are about to have may remind you of a psychiatry session. But I want to remind you that it is not. For one thing, there is no non-disclosure agreement. Anything you say may be used against you.""

""So far"", the Joker said, ""no one has been able to analyse me"".

""I know"", said Lucifer. ""You are an exceptional man, Mr Joker. But may I remind you, so am I. Now, what were you going to talk to me about?""

""Batman"" said the Joker.

""Yes"", said Lucifer. ""I was expecting that one. Does it bother you that he outlived you?""

""Outlived!"" cried the Joker in utter frustration ""he shouldn't exist!""

""I know"", said Lucifer. ""Life isn't fair. That really sucks, doesn't it?"" There was a hint of sarcasm in his voice, just enough to let the Joker know how much sarcasm he REALLY was capable of.

""I mean it's illogical"", said the Joker more calmly. ""Because when I'm gone he shouldn't be around. Becaue I CREATED HIM.""

""I understand"", said Lucifer. ""Believe me, I really do. And now you've lost control over your creation?""

""Yes!"" said the Joker in anguish. ""That IDIOT Bruce Wayne wont' get it. I made him what he is now, I gave him all his ideas, I manipulated him into doing it, I let him win.. I.. I created that horrible monster of goodness! And now when I'm gone he's out there fighting other supervillains who are just amateurs and losers!""

""And what did you do to create him?"" asked Lucifer.

""Well, to begin with, I killed his parents"" said the Joker. ""and then..""

""Would you say that creating this Batman character had anything to do with your conscience?"" Lucifer interrupted him. ""Could it be that you had more of a conscience than you could admit, and you actually felt bad about shooting a kids parents in front of him? But since you couldn't admit it, you had to project it on someone else? So you needed someone to do good where you had done bad? But it couldn't be you, it had to be him?""

""Maybe..."" said the Joker and went silent, as if he was dealing with something he had never thought of. Which he was. But then he snapped out of it. ""I don't have a conscience"", he said. ""I'm a psychopath, you know that. I'm the arch-psyochopath""

""If I were you, I'd think about who I was talking to when I said that"", said Lucifer mildly. ""But yes you are, of course. That's why we understand each other so well"". He smiled amiably.

""But there's more to it, isn't there?"" Lucifer continued. ""You needed a counterpart. A villain needs a hero as much as a hero needs a villain. Or the audience won't be interested for very long. You need a good guy to define yourself as a bad guy. Sometimes it's just that simple. Plain old trivial attention-seeking. Without him, they wouldn't remember you five days after your latest crime, no matter what you did.""

""Maybe not"", said the Joker, ""but..""

""They need the DYNAMICS"", said Lucifer. ""They need the FIGHT. So you needed an adversary, didn't you? You you HAD to create him! You had to let bats into his room when he grew up, so he would discover and be fascinated by them. You had to invent the bat signal and project it on the wall of his back yard where only he could see it. You had to send him all those stories about vampire bats when he was a kid. Yes, you made him. Without you, there would be no Batman. And now you think that since you're dead, he should disappear?""

""Yes"" said the Joker blankly. ""It would only seem fair that..""

""Fair!"" cried Lucifer in a sudden fit of anger. ""Who are you to ask for fairness? After all you've done? But I can tell you, life isn't fair. It never was. I'm older than mankind, so I can tell you that, because I know. I was around when your ancestors moved into the first caves. Life wasn't fair then and it isn't now! You'll just have to live with what happened. And watch the monster you created take on a life of its own and outlive you by centuries.""

"".. and have hiers.."" said the Joker blankly. "" Robin.. will be his successor.. and then when Robin dies.. he will have successors.."" 

""Exactly!"" said Lucifer, still angry. ""That wasn't what you wanted, was it? You created Batman and you convinced the world he existed. And you convinced BRUCE WAYNE he existed.. And you got Bruce Wayne to play the part.. And he did it too well! And now your creation is bigger than you are. People don't fear you any longer but they worship him. But you know what? You can't do anything about it! So just grow the fuck up and accept it!""

Wait. The Joker hadn't spent all that time with all those experts in Arkham Asylum for nothing. The psyciatrists had never gotten anything out of him, but he had learned from them. And even though he was a psychopath, or maybe even because of it, he was good at reading other peoples emotional responses. It never affected him, but he could tell what he saw.

""There is a personal issue here, Doctor"" said the Joker, ""Isn't there?""

Lucifer calmed down. And said nothing.

""Tell me"", said the Joker, ""why did you decide to share some of your precious time with me? You said you rarely talk to inmates.""

After a long silence, Lucifer said, calmly:

""Because you are one of the few people in the entire creation that might be capable of understanding MY problem.""

The Joker wasn't sure what emotional response he was picking up. It was confusing because it was so unlikely, but it was.. sadness.

""Something similar happened to you, didn't it?"" asked the Joker.

""I said we were going to understand each other"" said Lucifer.

The Joker said nothing, because just for once, he didn't understand. But then it dawned on him.

""Jesus"", he said.

Lucifer looked at him with the expression of a man who has made a terrible mistake and had to live with the consequences of it for two thousand years.

The Joker flares out his arms, flaps his jacket, exposes his vest, as Vicki Vale sits tied to the chair in front of him, mouth pressed into a flat unsmiling line. He tosses her camera at her and she flinches as it bounces off her collarbone and lands in her lap. ""Any or all of the above! I'm pleased to welcome you to the front seat of the Jokerfication of Gotham City!"" All around them the vats of the Ace Chemical Factory bubble and brew with a mix of deadly toxins, the central vat adorned with an arrangement of dynamite sticks and bright red timers counting down. 

""You'll never get away with this,"" are the words on the tip of her tongue, but they feel somehow wrong to say, stilted, as if she'd be reading from a script. Something's wrong. There are no video cameras here to broadcast his message to the city, no henchmen standing watch. Her abduction was remarkably untheatrical, just a sharp shock on the side of her neck as she exited her apartment, and then waking up here. Even the chemical bomb looks like a prop. The Joker hesitates, waiting for her line, and then abruptly looks up at the ceiling. Her eyes follow his. The skylight is a blank, a square of clouds and night sky. 

""What are you-"" she starts to say, and looks back just in time to see a little remote in his hand, finger on the button, as he still looks up with a stupid grin on his face, and then the skylight shatters. She cowers, glass shards raining off the back of her neck, and from her view of the floor there's the massive shadow of a bat spreading over them both. 

His laugh fills the room as the edges of a cape brush her cheek and her chair tips over from her abortive attempt to dodge the falling glass, and from her dizzied perspective on the ground she can see the Joker spinning wildly as a cape tries to strangle him. ""Batsy!"" he croons. ""How wonderful of you to join us!"" 

""It's over, Joker!"" a familiar voice roars, and she's hit her head and there's a trickle of blood running down into one eye, but even through her blurred vision Batman looks insubstantial, like a lot of flapping cloth. Joker goes flying backwards into a wall, the black cape trailing behind him, and she hears the wet sound of flesh against concrete. ""But we've only just begun!"" the Joker sings, and there's the sound of a pop gun and a puff of smoke and a handful of confetti fluttering into view. The wet noise sounds again, and again, interspersed with someone trying to laugh. A gun with a comically oversized barrel clanks against the ground and comes skittering into her line of sight, metal susurrating against concrete. There's one last loud meaty thunk, and the laughter dies and the factory falls silent but for the heavy sound of her breathing. 

Her head hurts and she's trying to blink the blood out of her eye when she hears someone get up, walk up to the explosives, and rip the timer to the floor. She sees the Joker's wingtips tapping past her face with the cape dragging behind them, and then two strong arms grab her by the shoulders and wrench the chair upright. Hot air brushes against her ear and she goes rigid, trying to edge away. 

""You're safe now, Miss Vale,"" Batman's voice rasps, and the cowl tilts just within her field of vision, floppy and hollow. The hole for the mouth gapes open like a puppet, and chalk white fingers peek through as teeth. Something sharp snicks through her bonds, and she sits there still, afraid to move. ""You're safe,"" the voice repeats, and she feels a warm wet kiss against the back of her neck that nearly makes her jump out of the chair. ""Mwah!"" the Batman voice says, and then there's a giggle and the person behind her tips backwards, out of reach. 

She sits tense in the chair, rubbing the welts the rope left in her wrists. Now she can properly see the scene of the fight, the bloodstains on the wall, the floor. She checks her camera, finds it unharmed, and decides against taking pictures at the moment. With infinite slowness, she rises from the chair, turning to see what is behind her. The Joker lies spread eagle, his face a mess of blood, eyes swollen shut. He's still holding a knife in his right hand, fingers closed loosely around it. There's not a sign of Batman to be seen. 

""Where is he,"" she says. It's an idiot question that she hates herself for the moment she says it, but it's the question pounding through her mind. Her voice, trembling at first, rises into a demand. ""Where the hell is Batman?"" She keeps the chair between the two of them, but he lies sprawled out like a rug, making no move to menace her.

""Don't look at me,"" he says, and every word sounds through a mouthful of mush. His lips and gums are a bright bloody red, mashed into a pulp. ""I'm done. Defeated. Finito."" He flaps one hand in the direction of the door, and she sees the cape and cowl there, hung on a hat rack in Batman's perfect silhouette. For a moment her mind is stymied with the issue of where on earth that hat rack came from. 

""Where is he?"" she repeats, trying to clear her mind. 

""You know how ol' Batsy is,"" and there's a faint whistle on the esses. He's missing teeth. ""Turn your back on him, and poof! He's gone!"" The Joker giggles lightly, bubbling up blood. ""Someone's momma never taught him any manners."" 

She takes an involuntary step towards him, and then goes diagonal instead, making a wide detour around his prone body. She moves cautiously at first, but finds herself breaking into a brisk jog, her heels clicking against the floor. One hand is on the door handle when she glances back, and there he is, unmoved from his spot. He's tucked his hands behind his head and crossed his legs, perfectly relaxed.

With one eye on him she checks on the cape and cowl. It's authentic, as far as she can tell, matching her memories from when she saw it up close. She puts her head within inches of the cowl, almost willing it to talk. It even smells of him, carries the trace of his scent. There's a sick fear in the pit of her stomach. She wants to take the hat rack, cave the Joker's skull in with it. Why not? No one's roles make sense anymore. 

""Aw, I'll miss the old bat-brain too."" She jumps at the sound of his voice. It's shifting, more intelligible now, but something different from what it was before. He's gotten to his feet without her hearing, brushing the dust from his suit. ""What's a joke without a punchline, after all? And Bats could punch with the best of them! But we gotta move on. We gotta find new routines. This 'Batman's gal-pal, damsel in distress' bit you've got going on? Kind of old hat!"" He coughs and rubs his throat and forces out a rasp. ""And frankly, I couldn't keep doing the voice. It was killing me!"" 

""You're lying,"" she says, clutching the cape and cowl to her chest, and catches herself right as she's about to say more. That's it, that's the trick, it has to be. He's trying to get her to confess, to say she knows Batman's secret identity. She backs up, feeling behind her back for the door handle. ""This is - this is all a show."" 

He simply beams at her, waving her off with his hands. ""G'wan! You're an investigative reporter, aren't you? So investigate! Report! Tell 'em everything! Run up to Wayne Manor and see what he has to say!"" His face has morphed through the blood, different parts swelling and receding into something eerily recognizable. ""Everything we've done up till now - that was the show. Now we all get to take off our costumes and decide who we want to be next!"" 

She finds the handle and twists, and nearly falls out backwards, her heel sliding on the rain-slick sidewalk, and starts running. The cape catches the wind, but she refuses to let it go. The long dark shape of the bat casts out behind her even as she begins to scream, disappearing into the Gotham night. ",sadoeuphemist

Her carriage jerked to a halt as all the horses in the caravan spooked. Their senses were keen, and they could smell what their riders and minders could not yet: sulfur and ash and blood. The smell of dragons. The smell of *death*. 

Gwendolyn rushed to yank open her windows. If she was to die, she would see it coming, and not burrow herself into expensive cushions trying to keep away the flames for a few seconds more. 

The knights tried to array themselves around her, but their panicked mounts made such a task impossible. Their lances were impossible to balance when the horses were determined to buck them and flee, and the heavy armor meant they could not easily twist themselves to keep their seats. A few were thrown entirely, and the forest's black shadows eagerly swallowed the fleeing horses. One man was unfortunate in that his foot tangled in the stirrup. His horse pulled him along as if he weighed nothing, iron-shod hooves fighting the man's armor as he was dragged and trampled both. It was a hundred feet before his screams cut off into a gurgle, and then he too disappeared into the dark. 

The dragon had by then swooped around for another pass, but instead of flying by, it landed with a crash and a snapping of ancient branches. Trees older than any castle broke with the sounds of loosing ballistae, no match for forty tons of black-charred dragonhide. 

The remaining knights stopped to stare up at the towering beast. Even the horses seemed frozen, all of them easily falling within the shadow of the great dragon's wings. Even the forest seemed to submit to the dragon, its shadows shivering and shrinking deeper into themselves in deference.

The peace was short lived and broken by fire. With another roar, a gout of flame leapt forward and engulfed half of her escort. With a casual swipe of its head, the flames had wreathed the men who'd been unhorsed and spared from the initial onslaught. In bare seconds, the finest of her father's knights were screaming and writhing as the fire seemed to cling to their armor and clothing. Metal turned to liquid and rolled down their bodies in streams, and their skin blackened and fell away to reveal white bone, until even that was charred and cracked. 

The screams died quickly, and Gwendolyn was alone in the forest with only an enormous dragon and two dozen ash-heaps that had once been knights. With her retinue dead, the dragon turned its eyes on her. It lowered itself towards her carriage, the massive head nearly larger than the carriage itself. It came to a stop barely an arm's length from her window, it's attention never wavering. 

The eyes were slitted, and the same poisoned yellow of dying sunflowers. Even the eyes were nearly as large as her head, and they remained focused on her. A translucent membrane briefly flickering horizontally across, leaving them glistening brightly even in the dim light. If she were asked, Gwendolyn would have said that they were lit from within, rather than by the sun. 

Time dragged on, and with the growing realization that the dragon-for whatever reason-wasn't about to kill her, Gwendolyn tried to lift her hand. Having been frozen still for so long, her muscles were tight and sore. Initially only her finger responded, and immediately the dragon's eyes flickered down towards the movement before returning to her face. 

Deciding that remaining still was getting her nowhere and with a growing curiosity, Gwendolyn tried again to raise her hand. This time she succeeded, and when the dragon failed to react, she reached forward. What possessed her to do such a thing she did not know, but reach forward she did. 

Her fingertips brushed against the black hide. The scales were as rough and strong as she'd imagined they would be. Stone would have had more give, but no stone could ever feel so wonderfully alive as the dragon did. There was an inner warmth to it that seemed to bubble up from somewhere deep within the dragon's chest, through her fingertips, and into her own beating heart. 

It was anger and passion and so much *heat*. No blacksmith's forge could hope to compare, but rather than burn, it invigorated her. The world before had been cold and dark, and she'd never even noticed that she was slowly freezing to death until she had touched the fire. 

Lady Gwendolyn grasped the head of the dragon that had only moments before slain two dozen of the most skilled knights in the Realm, and felt warm and loved and *safe.*

""You'll need a name."" A snort that sent a cloud of ash floating through the air was answer enough, and she nodded with a small smile. ""My mistake. Of course you already have one picked, I just need to puzzle it out."" 

She looked deep into those slitted eyes, but before the answer could come to her, the pupil flicked down towards her dress. She tilted her head in confusion, but when she looked down at herself she realized what the dragon was trying to imply. 

The soot that had once been Sir Sanson was beginning to cling her dress, darkening the pale white to a shade of sickly grey. She expected a surge of revulsion, having the ashen remnants of what was once a man burned to cinders decorate her gown, but the feeling never came. Instead, it felt natural. Right. Sir Sanson had been a blight on the world as a man, but he served well as a pigment to stain her dress. 

Looking around at the rest of what had once been men and seeing the wind slowly scatter them, an idea was born. She glanced over her shoulder in the way that they had come, towards the castle she'd been born in. Towards the castle her younger sisters still lived in. The castle her sisters would one day be sent away from to serve as broodwives for one petty noble or another, just as she had been. 

She looked towards the castle behind her, and then to the dragon in front of her. Without needing her to speak it aloud, the dragon nodded its agreement and bowed it head low to the ground. It was not a supplication, but rather an offer, and Gwendolyn took it.

She clambered upwards, using the rough scales and smaller spikes as handholds and footholds. By the time she reached a comfortable spot atop the dragon's back, her dress was covered in nicks and small tears, the smooth hem now ragged and swaying in the breeze. 

""I'm ready,"" Gwendolyn said, and the dragon launched itself aloft at once. A few powerful beats of its wings had them soaring high above the poisoned forest. The dragon banked sharply, and in short order they were headed towards a familiar castle that was only just visible as a shadow on the horizon. Each eager wingbeat brought them closer to Emy, and her sisters, and foul nobles who served the world better as pigments than as men. ",ArguingPizza

In the shivering heart of the darkened wood, there lies a road that slithers and snakes along, a tenuous thread binding the bright fields and brighter fortunes of the various Lords and would-be Princes of the River Realms. With deepened wheel ruts and weather-beaten pave stones that barely deserved the name, it had been hacked and carved and burned into being by men from a time of heroes and legendary honor. Such men, if they had ever truly existed at all, were seldom to be found in the time of distrust and feuding and blood. 

Brave though they must have been to challenge such a dreadful morass as the forest, and clearly unrelenting for their success in the endeavor, whatever other legacies they had thought to leave upon the world had withered and turned to dust. No stories of their glory survived the ages, no songs were sung or epics told. Not even their names had carried on. Instead, there was only the road left to testify that such men had once existed at all, and precious little of even that remained. The forest had seen to that.

The clank and banging of steel and wood beat an unsteady cadence as the carriage and the horses pulling it struggled with the odd mismatch of missing or misshapen stonework into which the road had deteriorated. Men in dull and dented steel armor bounced in their saddles along either side, a patchwork barricade between the carriage and the leering shadows. 

The carriage windows were dark, the curtains pulled tight over the windows to keep away the world. Within, a woman dressed in well-sewn finery hid herself away as best she could. Her ghostly white dress was wrinkled and bunched up high around her knees, to better allow her to pull them to her chest. The gold embroidery itched and chafed at her, made worse for the sickening feel it gave her of being gift-wrapped. A Lady of the Rapids, raised from birth in the fortified halls of her forebears and assured every day by sycophants and servants alike of her unending superiority to those who lived in the shadow of the castle that others insisted she call home. 

Such sweet lies they had spun; a few she had even allowed herself to believe, though she thought herself fortunate that those had been few and far between. Unlike her tender-hearted younger sisters, she had never been quite so comfortable basking in the keen attentions of her father's many retainers and courtiers. It made the sting of being trussed up and traded as if she were a ham at the market a less crushing betrayal. 

""Nearly there, Lady Gwendolyn,"" announced Sir Sanson. His voice grated on her ears, made worse by the false air of refinement he cloaked himself in. He was a hero in his own mind, a knight without peer in matters of both strength and honor. ""Less than half a day's ride now. We should arrive well before sunset.""

She'd seen him leaving the stables before they left her father's keep. A few moments later, one of her handmaidens-a girl of no more than ten- had come running out from within. Her dress had been torn to ruins, and her panicked gait held a noticeable limp even from a distance. There'd been tears and blood both, but none of the knights filling the square had batted an eye. 

Chivalry and honor were things to be boasted of, but not truly lived. Even at only sixteen, she knew well that propriety and law ended at the sword point. 

The memory of young Emy running from the men now charged with escorting her would not leave her. Her husband-to-be was a Prince nearing his fiftieth year, and she doubted he would be any more gentle than Sir Sanson. How loud would she scream, she wondered, unable to keep the thought away, nor the cold sweat that broke out on her neck. How much would it hurt? How many birthings would she even survive? Her betrothed would want to ensure himself an heir, and with the tendency of arrogant young lordlings to find themselves on the wrong end of much better swordsmen, redundancy was a must to ensure the House name survived. If the woman failed to survive...well, there were always others. 

Perhaps it would be better to ask one of her guards to simply slit her throat now. It would certainly save her suffering in the future, but having her last sight be that of Sir Sanson's foul grin turned her stomach until she thought she would weep. 

It was a relief, then, when the dragon roared. ",ArguingPizza
[WP] Rewrite a classic fairy tale by telling it backwards. The end is now the beginning.,platonic_mutton,"Snow White was completely and thoroughly heartless.

That wasn't to say she was vain woman, or that she had a cruel streak or was even the slightest bit ill-tempered. Instead, her heartlessness was a conscious decision, her ongoing effort to squeeze every last drop of emotion from her chest in a desperate bid to survive.

She had no idea where the curse had originally come from. These sort of things just… happened. To be honest, *all* the princesses of the neighboring kingdoms suffered from some kind of magical malady. You ended up being a kind of pariah if you didn't. Still, Snow White would've taken any single one of their curses - including Rapunzel's unchoppable hair, which was already starting to give the girl terminal back pain with a good six decades of her life left to go - over her own wonderful Kiss of Death.

Kiss of Death.

It sounded mysterious, intriguing even, out of context. Normally a curse like that was a one way golden key into the Inter-kingdom Assassins' Guild. Snow White could've maybe accepted that fate as unconventional as it was.

Unfortunately though, her Kiss happened to be yet another method of suicide rather than a weapon of murder. And, to add insult to injury, her Kiss of Death didn't apply to all her kisses, didn't even a apply to a majority of them…

No, Snow White had been fated to die from just a single, simple act: True Love's First Kiss.",roxannepark

He looked up to see a young kangeroo with a tube of superglue. Humpty smiled at this beautiful creature, and didn't even see it coming. The kangeroo hit Humpty Dumpty with its heavy tube of glue, until Humpty was in pieces. The kangeroo, pleased with its newest sacrifice, pissed on his corpse.

At around the same time, the king had decided to declare war on those jackass kangeroos (this story is set in Australia. It's kinda like the emu war) and sent all his horses and men to chase the immigrant kangeroos out of his land. The army chased the kangeroo that had killed Humpty until it was gone. But for the life of them, they could not work out what those fragments of eggshell were meant to be on the floor.

And then Humpty's immortal satanic soul caused the fragments to rise up into the air, and form a new humpty, better, stronger, and wanting revenge. Humpty sat on the wall, and looked down at the army that he could make obey him. He looked up at the kingdom he would lay waste to. He would make the world pay for the actions of the kangeroo.

""Jesus, I thought he was sedated!"" the surgeon shouted, as he began to abort the procedure. 

General Von Mure unsheathed his pistol and pointed it at the doctor, shaking his head in disapproval before the surgeon began to cut again. 

""Stop,"" the being said sternly, but oddly comfortably. There was no pain in his voice, nor any violent reaction against the procedure being performed on him. ""Do not let the sands flow."" 

""Collect it, every drop, err...grain,"" Von Mure instructed ""the President wants it all."" 

""General...."" the surgeon began before collapsing to the ground, his hands now purely skeleton and rot as if they had been in the ground for centuries. 

""My god,"" Von Mure began. ""Keep going, son!"" he ordered, but the affliction quickly spread before taking his lungs, causing him to cough up not blood, but dirt, worms, and maggots in his final breaths. 

""Seal off this room,"" the general ordered, ""and get me another surgeon."" 

The being rose from the table, the restraints having faded and disintegrated as well, the table he laid on now rusted and dilapidated. He pressed his hand on the seven inch thick security door and it rusted away as well, allowing him to pass through it to the once secure room where from the other doctors quickly fled, leaving only he and the general. 

The general pulled his gun, only to watch it too fall to pieces.

 ""I can not be controlled, I can not be weaponized, I will not be your pawn in this war. You have lost, and your lack of planning already runs in my veins, those days can not be changed, those days can not be altered, only I may alter as I so chose,"" the being said his hand upon the wound. ""This grain is your own, every moment of your 56 years, every battle, every struggle, every time you hit your wife in a drunken rage -- I have seen and stored it all within my blood -- I no longer wish to."" 

The being lifted the grain to his lips and with a blow the grain flew across the room and the general slowly began to disintegrate. Yet unlike the scientist who slowly rotted away, the general began to disappear, he was not dead, he simply never existed; Time had taken him away.

The wraith shrieked and flailed, smashing its limbs against those who attempted to restrain it. Contorting its body and becoming formless, it escaped its shackles and bounded forward, a vision of fury. The blinding rage of the sand demon would not let itself by held down by mere mortals. The men swung their swords at it in futility, slicing through the pouring sand, then being asphyxiated by the vomit of the dunes. As many men as could beat a hasty retreat across the makeshift moat they had constructed. Sand could not cross water, without losing its form and separating.

"[WP] They opened his veins, and sand poured forth.",seventh_chevron,"He was human, just like you. He came from the Earth and spread a message of life that was unfettered by moral constraints of the mortal. In this, he was special. He could see beyond his fragile shell. And he could stir such deep emotions within the people that they could not remember what their lives were like before he spoke.

The public officiator took offense at this man. Why, he was a newcomer from the foreign lands to the East. No one really knew what lay to the East, except for the lush, green rain forests that evoked a visceral fear in these descendants of the desert settlers. The people embraced the wanderer's ideals and expressions of love, and this scared the public officiator, for this government ruled by fear and without fear, there was no power. Without power, the officiator had no protection. He lived a very extravagant lifestyle and he was not about to let it go.

He hired an assassin to kill the peace-spreader in the dead of night. The assassin took the job and promised to deliver his head in the morning. However, when the morning came, the assassin came empty-handed. The officiator cursed and screamed at this shadowy figure, demanding an explanation. ""This man does not deserve to die, my lord,"" was the only explanation. The assassin retired from his life in the shadows and went to live his life dedicated to helping others. This did not deter the officiator, since he was a greedy man, and he hired a different assassin. The same promise was made, and the officiator did not wait until morning to see whether the promise would be delivered. Instead, he followed the assassin to the preacher's mud-brick home in the slum districts. 

As soon as he saw the assassin enter the home, the officiator ran to the open window to listen to the sounds of the dying. No death reached his ears. Only a conversation between the assassin and the homeowner. No, this cannot be happening again!

The officiator sprang up and climbed into the room stealthily from the window. He reached inside his waistband to unsheathe the dagger hidden within. The two other occupants were distracted by their conversation, and since the peace-speaker could not afford candles, his house was only lit by the stars outside. The officiator found it exceedingly easy to maneuver behind the homeowner without raising any suspicion. As the conversation continued, and the assassin looked increasingly disturbed, the officiator raised his dagger.

The deed was done and the man was no more. The man, the husk of fragile mortality, was gone. But his spirit began to live in the people he spoke with. The assassin who was the witness to his martyrdom began to speak about the last words of this incredible man. The beating heart of the desert-dwellers began to accept the peace this man had spoken of, and the people were beginning to rebel against the harsh treatment of the officiator. 

Before a year had passed, the officiator had been killed by the very assassin he had hired to kill the poor wanderer the second time. It was a nearly bloodless coup, with the exception of this man who could not let go of his greed to see how he was affecting his people, because the other government officials were able to see how interconnected they all were in the grand scheme of life, thanks to the tireless efforts of the new preacher-assassin. Their city blossomed into a new epicenter of education and art in the region.

When discussing the original speaker, the new preacher-assassin always wears a heavy expression, as if never truly over the loss of his mentor. Dissenters, though rare, harangued him constantly with questions. ""But he was of the jungle! What use is his knowledge to the desert life?"" ""If he was so great, how could he die so easily?"" He usually does not respond to this blatant disregard of the intended message. 

But, if you can get him to say anything at all, he eventually says of the wanderer: ""They opened his veins, and sand poured forth."" ",frogs_4_eva
"[WP] The call-girl you ordered shows up. As you open the door, you recognize her immediately. After all, she sat in the desk next to yours all throughout highschool.",soulofthereaver,"The cold words shocked Nikki, rooting her to the floor. She hadn't even fully entered the cramped, tiny apartment yet when her client spoke to her, calling her by name. By her *actual* name. Here, she was supposed to be Stacy. Stacy Lovelace. But the unfamiliar short man, who would have looked like a boy if it weren't for the ridiculous tattoos covering each of his arms and extending to just below his jawbone, had said ""Nikki"". 

She stammered out an apology, still confused, wondering if maybe she got the wrong apartment, but no, because he clearly knew *what* she was here for, maybe... maybe... what? It didn't make sense to her. She turned and started to leave when she heard a braying laughter that sounded like a donkey's cry from the man inside the apartment.

""Well, don't go before you service me, slut!"" He called after her. His voice sounded like he was intentionally trying to deepen his voice.

Nikki turned, and asked, ""I'm sorry, do I know you?""

She carefully studied the pre-maturely balding figure before her. His body-frame reminded her of an upside-down triangle. He clearly worked out, but he also clearly adhered to the stereotype-trope of ""skipped leg day"". His upper body and arms were well-built, she couldn't deny, but clearly visible below his basketball shorts were skinny legs that couldn't have been any wider than her wrist, even at their thickest, meatiest parts. 

""Typical woman for ya,"" He addressed no one in particular, smugly grinning and tracing her body up and down with lewd eyes. ""Used to cheat off me in school and now can't even give me the respect I deserve when she has no use for me.""

Then it clicked. At least, it half-clicked for Nikki. The only boy she had ever ""cheated"" off of in High School was Richard Tiney. He had been a nice boy that she had had a crush on, and as an excuse to talk to him, Nikki had pretended to be incredibly bad at Chemistry, the class they shared together. But Richard had been quiet and shy, and instead of giving her the tutor lessons like she had hinted and hinted and finally outright asked for, he simply gave her permission to cheat off his test papers. 

This was a privilege she had never once used.

Standing before her was, somehow, the boy that had once been that nice, introverted cutie from her High School.
Richard continued, ""Well guess what, bitch, you do have a use for me. See, I've got money that you want and you've got pussy that I want.""

Nikki was utterly baffled. ""Oh my god, Richard, what-""

But before she could continue, Richard immediately interjected by shouting, ""Ohhh-ho ho! Looks like little miss sucks-a-dick *can* remember someone when there's money in it for her!"" and spun  around in a circle with his arms raised above his head like a... ballerina? Nikki wasn't sure what the gesture was supposed to mean or represent, only that he looked like a complete buffoon performing it.

Richard came to a halt and pulled a phone out of his pocket. ""Wait a minute, wait a minute, slut, I've just *gotta* tell my bro about this. He is ne-ver go-ing to be-lieeeve this!"" he said, punctuating each syllable and stretching out the ""e"" sound in the word ""believe"". 

Disbelief was turning quickly to disgust for Nikki. 

Using a speech-to-text function on his phone, Richard said, ""Hey bro, check it, remember we were talking about AWALT the other day? And you were saying there were just some girls in High School that just couldn't possibly...""

Richard continued dictating a giddy, moronic diatribe into his phone about the inferiority of women while Nikki's brain made a sudden connection. She had heard the term ""AWALT"" before. Looking at Richard, it suddenly became very  clear what had happened to that nice young boy she had at one time fantasized about while using the detachable showerhead in the bathroom of the house she had grown up in. 

She put on her work-face, and began taking long strides towards her client. Long and slow strides, over-stepping each foot to cross her legs seductively as she moved forward, popping her hips up and down with each step. 

""Richard, baby,"" she cooed. ""Put that phone down, honey...""

Richard had abruptly stopped talking, thunderstruck at the change that had occurred while he had been too pre-occupied to notice. In his mind, he was still thinking dictating the message to send to Gary, his friend of ten years, and about whom Richard had and continued to fantasize about in his own shower, from both the house he had grown up in to the dingy apartment he occupied now.

Nikki was directly in front of him. ""So,"" she said in a long drawl, ""You're a big man now, Richard? You're a big, al-pha man?"" She said, annunciating each syllable in the same, annoying way he had just done to her. 

She gave a wicked grin, and slapped the phone out of Richard's trembling hand. It fell to the floor with a clatter. ""Al-pha man. Al-pha man. Richard ""Dick"" Tiney. Tiny Dick Richard."" Nikki leaned in close. She was taller than Richard, even without high heels on. ""Al-pha man.""

Nikki slapped him. Not too softly. Richard gaped, unsure of what to do. Nikki slapped him again with her other hand.
""Well, Alpha? You're going to let me slap you? You're going to let a *woman* slap you around?"" Nikki barked, truly angry. Angry that the boy she had crushed on had grown into such a vile man. *""Man""*, she corrected herself in her own head, putting air-quotes around the word.

She raised a hand to slap him again, when Richard suddenly shouted, ""No!"" and Nikki braced herself, fearing that she had gone too far. She tensed her body and involuntarily her eyelids flickered in anticipation of the impact of the punch she knew he was about to throw and knowing it would be worth it, it would be so fucking worth it, to punish him, punish her, punish them both, punish the son-of-a-bitch ex-egghead husband that found that stupid fucking subreddit and started forcing her to prostitute her body, her own body, just because it gave him sexual excitement knowing that other men were having his wife, while he worked out and spent hours admiring his own muscles in the mirror and pretending he was the captain of a fantasy pirate ship or some other kind of asinine shit when suddenly Richard was gone. 

She scarcely realized it before he was out the door, but he had apparently shouted ""no"" and bolted out of his own apartment.

[WP] You jump out of a parachute and realize that your airplane will not open.,Hylian_Solider97,"The parachute, as it flies through the sky, seems like it was a distant memory. Something that Long ago, was my favorite activity. To sky dive all those years ago would give me adreniline, a euphoria so strong not even drugs would enable to match those feelings I had. In my blue spandex I walk towards the spot where I would jump off an fall hundreds of meters. 
This would he one of my first times. Maybe my third or fourth, I hadn't known about proper safety of this sport, but also at the time, I was impatient. 
The time was right. I put on a plane bag, and opened the door, ""Did you check your bag to see if it is properly assembled?"" ""Yes"" 
So I squated, looked down, and jumped.
It felt like heaven, as I slowly fell down, I could feel the pressure of the wind against me, as gravity pulled onto me.i kept gaining speed as the ground got closer, I was able to low myself down, finally decided it was time to pull the bag.
When the plane didn't come out. I had realized the cost of my lies. I continued to fall and I didn't know what to do. So I did only what I could have, I took off the top of the bag, and manually activated the plane myself. But even with the plane activated, it wasn't enough to slow my fall by much. I was then that I had accepted my fate. 
I was going to die that day. To my surprise however, I was wrong. Once I hit the ground. It was strong, but the angle I fell was not straight ahead. I was alive, but lost my legs in the process. Now I can only watch people jump out of parachutes, and even warn them about safety, but I can no longer do the jumping myself.

"[WP] You are the apocryphal gravedigger, burying forgotten legends and dead gods. You keep them from cluttering up the Collective Unconscious of mankind. Sometimes, they don't want to go.",IWasSurprisedToo,"Martholus of the hundred blades walked among countless graves in an unfamiliar cemetery shrouded in mist. His golden armor and legendary blade adorned his muscular figure, making him stick out in the gloom. He couldn't recall how he got there, nor why he had been summoned to the nameless graveyard. He walked carefully as to not disrespect the fallen by walking on their graves. He read the names on the tombstones as he walked, but couldn't recognize a single one.

Martholus's warrior senses heightened as a noise in the distance caught his attention. With a hand on his famous blade Goroga, he approached the sound in the mist. As he stepped closer, the sound became clearer and clearer until he could recognize it. He relaxed as he heard the sound of moving earth, and a man hard at work.

""You're early. Can't say I'm all that pleased, but I suppose early is better than late."" The working man called out to the legend approaching him.

""Excuse me sir I seem to be lost. Where am I exactly?"" Martholus asked as he approached the gravedigger. the gravedigger wore a ragged leather vest and a large hat that kept his wrinkled skin in constant shade. 

""A graveyard for things already buried, or can't be."" The gravedigger answered as he shoveled another scoop of earth. 

""A confusing answer if I ever heard one. Do you know where the great hall of Magaria is? I was enjoying the feast of the ancients when I suddenly found myself here."" Martholus asked as he looked around the mist.

""Magaira. So that's already starting to fade. The world needs to stop turning so quickly, or its going to ware out these old bones. Yes I've heard of Magaria, but there's no road to it from here. In fact, I'd say there's no road to anywhere from here."" The gravedigger answered.

""That's absurd old man. Are you working for the witch Tasna? Has she started another scheme for me to foil? The witch never learns."" Martholus said with confidence

""Take a look to the grave to your right kid"" The gravedigger answered without pause. 

Martholus followed the gravedigger instruction. Displayed on the tombstone was only the name Tasna of the sunken keep. Martholus stared at the stone in confusion before turning back to the grave digger.

""What is the meaning of this? I defeated Tasna at Iggeron valley, she should be fighting me in the afterlife with her ancestors. Why does she have a tombstone here, and not with her body?""

""Her body was buried at Iggeron valley, here legend is buried here.""

""Where is here exactly?""

""This is where legends go when they have fallen from human memory. This is where legends die kid."" The gravedigger answered as he tossed the last shovel full of earth from the hole. He tossed the shovel to Martholus who caught it out of reflex. With a groan the gravedigger pulled himself from the pit and took the shovel back. 

""I don't understand. I'm Martholus of the hundred blades, my legend is eternal.""

The gravedigger gave a small laugh as he admired his hard work. ""Eternal is a foreign concept the the ever changing thing we know as the mortal world. Just as legends are born, legends die. Just like the real life people they're attached to. You were born and buried at the capital of the kingdom of Bosk were you not?""

""Yes."" Martholus answered

""And your legends was born from the people of Bosk, am I wrong?""

""No.""

""And now the people of Bosk have changed faith. The same faith your legend was attached to.""

""The people would never do such a thing!""

""The people would, and they did. Time changes all things Martholus, life and death follow suit."" The gravedigger said as he stared at the tombstone at the head of the pit. Martholus followed his gaze, and read his own name on the stone.

""No. This cannot be. There must be a mistake. I am eternal, the legend of Martholus is eternal.""

""Take a look around you kid. How many of these name did you recognize as you walked the graves? How many of these gods did you recognize?""

Martholus stared at the gravedigger, unable to recall the people behind any of the names he read. Martholus stepped back as the reality of the situation slammed into him. He drew his sword and pointed it towards the gravedigger. ""I am Martholus of the hundred blades, I will not be forgotten, and I will not rot in this grave!"" He shouted at the gravedigger.

""It's not your choice kid. Everything must repay the gift of life with death. Gods and legends are no different.""

""And what of you gravedigger?! Will you bury your own legend?""

""No. I won't bury my legend because it will never start. Now put that useless sword away.""

""This blade has seen me through many battles, and it will see me through this one.""

""Kid, there are two ways you can go in that grave. I'll either bury your bones with peace and dignity, or I can hack you apart and bury you screaming."" The gravedigger said as the mist engulfed him. 

""You think you can best me in combat?"" Martholus said as he tried to find the gravedigger in the mist. A skeletal hand burst through the mist and grabbed Martholus's shoulder. Martholus tried to break free from it's grasp, but as he struggled his armor rusted and eroded away. He tried to strike the arm with his sword, but that also rusted and shattered as it struck the skeletal arm. Martholus felt his youthful vigor fade and fell to his knees. The mist cleared revealing what the gravedigger truly was, just a skeleton in ragged clothes.

The gravedigger released his hold of the hero and offered his choice once more. Martholus staggered to his feet and threw a weak punch at the skeleton.

The gravedigger caught the slow punch and watched the old hero fall to his knees once more. ""Do you know how many gods are buried here kid? Of course you don't, you can't even name one. I make it a point to remember everyone who is buried here, because I'm the only one who can."" The gravedigger said

""So my legend will live on?"" Martholus said through labored breaths.

""In a way."" The gravedigger answered.

Martholus smiled at the answer and collapsed shortly after. ",EndToStart
[WP] A teenager stumbles across a wizard's spell book forgotten in a public library.,InsanitySquirrel,"Mark puffed, blowing his cold, or rather a little less hot, breath against his own forehead. Blowing up a curl of his hairs momentarily. It was winter, but he didn't feel any of that lovely cold in the library. No, the library was inhabited by sand demons. At least that is what it felt like with its thirty degree temperature. 

He huffed and puffed some more as he turned through the pages of the book in front of him. He was looking for a specific book on history, for one of his big assignments. But so far the books he picked out had proven to be utterly useless and of no value whatsoever to his research. With a defeated sigh he closed the book and got up from his desk again. His desk was situated in a small, dark corner of the library. The temperature was a bit lower here which only meant he despised getting up and returning to the warmer regions of the library even more. 

He forced himself to wear a fake smile as he passed on of the librarians. Her beauty made it much easier of course but the heat was a huge damper on his jolliness. He cocked his head to the left as he walked past the long row of old and dusty books. All about some obscure part of history that nobody really cares about until they need it for an assignment. Or so he thought. He didn't vocalize his opinion though. You never know if the cute librarian likes that particular obscure part of history. 

His eyes were dozing off and he was about to call it a day when they fell on a awkward looking book. It looked out of place. The heat slowed down his thought process and that was the biggest reason it took him several seconds to realise it was the fact that it had no text on its spine that stood out. His interest piqued he took it out from the shelf, from between two very obese works on opinionated history. One about pigs and their treatment in 180-whatever and another one that combined all the busted theorems on Alchemy. 

The book had a very thick and sturdy cover. All leather, and fancy looking at that. The leather was thick and even though dusty, clearly of high quality. The front and back and carvings in the leather, making beautiful patterns. The corners and sides where decorated with odd symbols and circles. The front's centre had a large circle in it, filled with more symbols and lines going through it.  Just underneath the circle was a sentence, or at least Mark thought it was. It was written in a very strange alphabet. Oddly familiar. The back just had more symbols and circles on it, but some circles had words of the same script inside of them. 

Mark looked to the librarian. He took a moment to appreciate the lovely curves nature had bestowed upon her and then noted that she wasn't at all looking at him. So he grabbed the book and then took a few more ad random and then returned to his desk. As he passed her again he gave her his fake smile again, but she didn't even took the effort to answer his now. He groaned and quickened his pace. He was relieved when he finally sat dawn in his dark corner. Curiously he opened the book on the first page. 

The first page was blank. Apart from a crimson red smudge at the bottom of the page. It looked an awful lot like blood, but the pattern it made was too complex to be formed by a simple smudge. He turned the page and saw two pages filled with the same old script. Afraid that he wouldn't be able to read the book he quickly turned on, but to his relief he found plain English there. Not his native language but he controlled it well enough to read, write and speak. With his hands on the pages he started to read. His assignment a long and forgotten memory. 

&gt;*This is the book of Makadamus Memarus. Practitioner of the shade, conjurer of the great, whisperer of the old word. Magicus by profession, scholar by nature. Disciple of the great Azuu, master of Albeiron, Grimwald and Merlin. Grand Meister of the Arcane of the court of Mezarim. Passionate lover of the fair lady Buzulum.*

&gt;*This book is my magical aide, my arcane grimoire. It chronicles all the spells I was taught and all the spells I made. Once cast or never cast, all the same. Filled with shapes and words, all equally capable of destroying the mortal fool's mind. Of warping the mortal's flesh. Of bending even mother nature to my own will. So if you are a mortal fool that found my book. Put it back where you found it and ignore it for the remainder of your life or face the curse of Makadamus Memarus first hand!*

*A wizard? A magical book? What kind of horse shit is this?* Thought Mark as his face moved to show his disappointment. *And I thought this was going to be something interesting...* He sighed deeply, turning to the next pages. Here there was a fancy illustration. Probably depicting Makadamus Memarus. The man depicted had a long, wide beard. Dark brown with streaks of white in it, much the same as his hair. His face was twisted in a grimace of pure bravery and bravado. He was wearing a mix between medieval armour and a wizard's robe, wielding a long staff and a shield. He was battling a dragon, the fire of its maw bashing against the shield. The staff lighted up at the top and on the ground beneath the dragon, large pylons of earth rising up and seemingly piercing its belly. *Classical sword &amp; sorcery comic right there* Mark thought to himself as he continued to the next page. 

Another illustration was put on here. But instead of showing Makadamus it showed Buzulum, his wife. Or at least the woman he was the lover of. In all fairness, she was beautiful. She had long, jet black hair that went in endless waves until just above her bum. Which was nicely curved as well, even more so then the librarian. She had pale white skin, like cream, and green deep eyes. Her lashes where seemingly perfect, as were her lips and cheeks. Her bust was ample, round and perfectly in shape and size. Her waist was thin and her hips wide. Thighs thick and her bum round. Only clothed in a skimpy, revealing, seemingly transparent black gown the illustration succeeded in making Mark blush and fill with desire. He could understand why Makadamus would love her. 

After a long pause to take in the artists work Mark finally moved on. The next page was blank aside of another word in the strange script. But Mark thought it looked like a chapter heading. After that there was a more decorated page filled with both the strange script and English. A small set of drawings was in there as well, showing a human hand with the index and middle finger pointing forward while the ring and pinky finger where bend down with the thumb over them. There where small notes under the images, telling how it was important for the stream of the arcane to hold your hand like this with this spell. 

Mark skipped the strange script as he couldn't read it anyway and went straight for the English. 

&gt;*Aka davim. The spell of the spark. This was the first spell my old meister taught me and alas it will be the first spell I write down. Simple enough that any fool can cast it, even the dumbest of mortals, yet such a wide use that it can come in handy in any situation. Simply form the gesture as shown in the illustration, speak the words in Old Kravinn and give away to the pulling feeling of the Arcane suction. But be sure to end it too, else you'll be drained from life faster then you can fart your name.*

Mark looked suspicious at the words. It seemed so simple. Would this truly be all that was needed to do magic? Of course it wouldn't work. It couldn't. Right? Mark was tempted to try it. He wanted to, even though his mind told him it was possible, something inside of him wanted to believe. So he practices forming his hand like the image, which was easy enough. Then he went back to the text. He assumed that 'Old Kravinn' was the strange script. Now he just needed to find the spell and figure out how to read it. As he studied the text and the script he noticed they were of seemingly the same length. So perhaps the English was a translation. If that was so, then the spell was probably 'Aka Davim'. 

Mark grinned. Would a spell really sound that stupid? He looked over his shoulder and confirmed the librarian had left. Then he formed his hand and pointed at his hat that lay on the table. It was a woollen hat one of his ex's had made for him. It was cosy and warm but he wouldn't miss it. If this worked, which of course it wouldn't. So with a stupid grin he pointed his two fingers at the hat and then spoke the words. ""Aka Davim."". 

First he felt nothing and he wanted to start laughing at how silly this must looked. Then he felt the 'pull'. It pulled on him, deep inside of him. On his hearth. No. On his soul. First he fought but then he remembered the text and let go, allowing it to pull. It hurt. It felts as if a part of him got ripped out. But just as he wanted to scream out in pain his fingertips lighted up. A bright spark emerged from them and shot forward, hitting his hat. The spark exploded in a small flame and soon his hat was on fire. He shrieked both in fear and surprise. He remembered enough of the text to stop the pull and keep blocking it until it went away. Then he grabbed his water bottle and doused the fire. Breathing heavy. Looking at the book with big eyes. Unable to believe what just had happened. 

He just had cast a spell.

Then this regal old man the adults treat with great reverence engages you, an oddball named ""Napoleon.""",KaieriNikawerake,"First time writing from a prompt but here it goes!

 Why had father brought me here? The island was hot, the atmosphere hanging heavy and humid every hour of the day. 
My father is a botanist, and studies all sorts of plants and herbs. His studies have made for many insightful discoveries in medicine, but make for very little fun or stimulation for a boy my age. While my peers were learning trades, chasing girls, or having adventures, I was marooned here, on this island. 

It's not all terrible though. On one of my exploring expeditions I stumbled upon a stone house covered in snarled vines. I stayed in the woods near the house, maybe 30 yards out. Through the windows I could see movement in the form of a dark silhouette. I approached the house, my feet crunching brittle twigs and grass. When I was 5 yards from the entrance, the front door swung open with a loud "" Whoosh!"" and exposed an old man short in stature. ""Good morning young one"" he greeted me in a gruff French tone ""what brings the young explorer to my castle today?"". 

I politely spoke with the old man for a few minutes, describing my father's works on the island and my desires for freedom and adventures. He laughed a reminiscent and encouraging laugh. There was an air of calm wisdom about him. Needless to say, I took to the old man quickly. 

When ur returned back to my island hut that night, I told my father of my newfound friend.  He seemed disinterested until he asked for the man's name. ""Mr. Bonaparte"" seemed to spike his interest, as his gaze focused into my eyes and his face became stern when I answered his question. My father was pleased that I was keeping myself entertained, and told me to return to Mr. Bonaparte's tomorrow to see if he needed any work done for him. The idea seated itself firmly in me, as I was excited to fill a day with some hard work and to learn more about my new friend.

Before I left in the morning, my father gave me some bread and cheese to take with me for lunch. He also gave me a couple teabags he himself had made with a special blend of herbs. He told me it was for Mr. Bonaparte as a gift for giving me work. I bounded out the door and into the wooded path towards the stone house.

I greeted Mr. Bonaparte outside his home, and asked him if he needed any help with projects around the house. He showed me inside and upstairs, where I would be building a shelf for his bedroom. As I got to work assembling the beach-wood shelf, I stumbled upon an ornately decorated military uniform in his closet. The lapels were gold like the rising sun, and the blue and white of the uniform were richly colored and stainless. I mused with myself, pretending to be a soldier holding a plank of wood turned rifle. Mr. Bonaparte came upstairs with the tea, and sat in a chair in the corner of the room. He sipped it and smiled at me, noticing I had seen the contents of the closet. ""I was once a great general you know."" He laughed and shook his head ""The greatest in all of Europe. Yes, the British, Prussians, and even the Russians had a hard time stopping me. But alas, the empire tired of war, and I came here""

I didn't exactly understand what he meant, but I nodded my head and looked intently at him as he spoke and sipped at his tea. I finished the shelf after an hour of work, and departed after saying goodbye to Mr. Bonaparte. 

I returned to the but in time for supper, and told my father about everything I had done that day. He asked if Mr. Bonaparte liked he work I did and if he liked the tea I brought. I replied ""yes!"" with a quick smile.  

When I returned to Mr. Bonaparte's on the third day, I was met with no greeting. I knocked on the large oak door, only to be answered with silence interrupted by the sounds of the forest. I pushed open the door and called out. No response. I walked through the hearth, then into the kitchen. There was a kettle on the stove that had a hole burnt right through it. At the table in the dining room sat Mr. Bonaparte, his back turned to me. I called to him, but he sat there silently staring into the woods. When I tapped him on the shoulder, I froze. His skin was clamy and stiff. I moved my body into his gaze, and horror shook me. Mr. Bonaparte was dead. A thin stream of dried blood ran from his bottom lip to the tip of his chin. His face was a pale blue, and his eyes had rolled back. I shuddered in fear and shock, then bolted home through the woods. When I returned, my father stood out front of the hit, our belongings loaded onto the back of a carriage.

The short little man glared at me. ""Zat is an insult of ze first degree! I vill not stand for zis mockery!""

The short man had been talking with Father and the other adults for a long time now, and they had only now gone back to their own projects. They were really respectful of this old, weird man, and I had no idea why. 

""But you say things very weird.""

""Vell, it is because I am from France, a place vere the children are not rude little brats!"" 

Ouch. Why was this guy so grumpy? Maybe if I prodded some more I could figure it out.

""Are they very grouchy in France?""

He huffed indignantly. ""No! Zey are great conquerors and leaders! Like me!"" 

Well, this was interesting. ""You were a great leader?""

""Brat, I haf conquered so much of Europe, it vould make your puny brat-brain explode!""

This midget? Yeah, right. ""But you're so short! How did you even get on your horse?"" 

The little man's cheeks turned red. ""Not all ze horses are zese massive giants zat you haf in your British countries. I vas able to conquer most of Europe and size vas no matter, brat!""

I mulled this over. ""So you really did win a lot of battles?"" 

He went from angry to a proud smile, as if he was looking back on his glory days. ""Yes, I haf. More than you haf ever won playing your soldier games!""

Huh. So this little guy was actually a great leader? I guess it made sense- he was pretty angry, after all, and isn't that what leaders do? I still had one question, though: 

""How did you do all of that with your hand in your shirt pocket? Wouldn't you have to fight one-handed?""

He turned beet red again. This guy was like a chameleon! ""It is a *skin condition!*""

""I just don't know if I can do this by my self, maybe I should come back another day with my wife and we can do this together.""

""Dave, listen to me when I tell you that estate planning is the single most important thing you will ever do in your life. The funeral, the casket and burial aren't for you friend, its for those who love you.  Taking care of things saves your loved ones the burden dealing with all of this after your passing. I can assure you that its  a very painful process for all of the families that come to me."" I said to Dave. I needed to impress upon him in a subtle manner that if he put off the arrangements today, he might not get another chance. I could tell him how short of a time he had left but I doubt it would have been taken seriously or mattered.

""I have no doubt that in life you were a responsible man. The kind who plans his life and works towards goals to see your family and your needs taken care of. This is no different Dave. Everyone dies, but not everyone has the chance to plan ahead.""

""You're right,"" Dave had a tear in his eye and a lump in his throat but that large proud man held back his emotions,""This is the right thing to do. I don't want to be any kind of burden to my family when I'm gone. Ill take that package there."" He said pointing at a lovely deal which included a natural oak coffin, funeral service and a burial spot at a nearby cemetery that was nice enough.

""You will not regret this decision Dave. I promise you that when the time comes, your family will be grateful this was taken care of before hand."" Dave Leaned back in his chair after we had finished signing the details and making payment arrangements. He had a look I was all to familiar with. He had the look of a man who needed to speak thoughts so intimate and personal he dare not even speak them to the closest and most trusted.

""Dave, if you need to talk about something, its alright you are more than welcome to talk about anything.""

""Its just..."" He took in a great breath as he held back the emotion. ""I'm scared."" he almost looked in shock from the words he had just spoken to me. ""I was a biker, smoked 2 packs a day for 20 years. 7 years ago I gave it all up, the smokes and the bikes but it was to late. I've had a persistent cough lately so I went to the doctor yesterday."" He paused again, he wiped away a tear on his cheek. ""Its stage 4 lung cancer and I might only have months to live.""

""I'm sorry to hear that Dave, have you made plans for treatments?"" I knew the outcome already, but that is neither something I would share or he would believe.

""No, I decided  to forgo treatment and spend my remaining time with my family.

""I think that's a smart decision Dave."" I said.

""You must think I look stupid, sitting here crying like a baby, you deal with this every day right?""

""Dave, I do deal with this every day, but its not a trouble. I find that its an important step in ones life. When planning ones estate, it doesn't matter if you have 1 year or 100 years of life ahead of you. The decision is to acknowledge and accept that we all must die eventually, what matters most is how you spend the time you have left. Do you have any regrets, or perhaps a bucket list? I asked.

""I've always wanted to take a cruise to the Bahamas, but It feels selfish wanting something for myself. I should be out working doubles to save money for my kids college. I just feel so confused about what I'm suppose to be doing with my life right now, as short as it might be"". Said Dave

""Dave, I'll give you the same advice I give everyone who comes to me."" I paused, I wanted to make sure he was paying attention.""Live for yourself. Spend your remaining days, no matter how many remain in a way that brings you happiness and peace. I swear to you, the best thing you can do for you and your family is to just be happy.""

""That's it, just be happy?"" Dave asked incredulously

""That's it Dave.  Can you think of anything else your family would want from you? Don't you want your family to be happy? Joy is a wealth we all poses a wealth which will increase exponentially the more it is given freely."" Dave thought about this for a moment.

""No, you're right.  When my family looks back on their last days with me, I want them to remember them as the happiest."" He nodded his head in agreement with the conclusion he had come to. I tear rolled down his cheek, but this was a tear of relief and joy. The man had become unburdened with the world and realized he was a free man to enjoy life to its fullest.

Dave stood and extended his hand for another palm crushing shake. ""Hey Mort, thanks. You really helped me see things in perspective. I hope I don't see you again any time soon right?"" He gave a little morbid laugh.

""I hope so to Dave."" I said as he went out the door. I knew I would be seeing him far to soon again, but I felt as if I had helped him as best I could in the short amount of time he had left. 
I left my private office and returned to the main gallery where the coffins where kept, soon enough a potential customer entered. She was elderly, but healthy, and a spark in her eye.

""Hello mam, how may I help you?""

""I don't want to be here, but my family says its time I do this.  I am 76 years old and I don't plan on dying, so lets just get this over with."" She said in a rather matter of fact tone.

""Tell me mam, do you have any hobbies?"" I asked her.

""A few, why?""

""Just curious about how you might spend the rest of your days."" I said, leading her towards my office. I would give her the usual information on funeral packages.

""I plan on raising hell to the end."" She said confidently, a sly grin on her aged face.

""Whats your name mam?""

""Mable."" 

Mable was going to live to a very healthy active 109 years young.

"[WP] You know when people will die, you are a mortician trying to sell caskets.",MonkeyWithAGun42,"William Gray took one look at me with a bored expression spread across his wrinkled face, and pointed toward the door. I asked him whether he needed me to prove that I could smell death, and instead of verbally telling where I could shove it, he took it upon himself to push me out the door.

He was the town Mortician, and I thought I’d get a bit further dealing with him instead of going up to the dying directly. I didn’t much like the panic.

I chose towns big enough to host two morticians with private funeral homes, yet small enough to not have too much competition and threatened to take my services elsewhere or get commissions for my sales and got my way until the townsfolk decided that I was a demon, evil spirit, the devil himself once, and usually a witch. 

Every town I entered saw a surge in crucifix sales. It took about ten predictions for people to cross the street when they saw me, and to fill the churches every Sunday. By the twentieth they just about chased me out with burning stakes. 

Cities proved difficult with caskets sold around every corner, and the tourists that didn’t quite stay in the same place to die, so I roamed little towns and hoped the gossip queens would take their time noticing me. 

“William,” I said as the door closed in my face. I knew he still stood there, I could almost see him peeping through the window. “I’m going to go to George Cramer if you’re not going to take me seriously. And I’ve seen that man; he’s about a missing cookie away from becoming a murderer himself. I had to cross my chest just to think about coming to him with my offer.” 

That line usually worked. Despite being morticians themselves, they always somehow found the other guy to be a weirdo for his choice of profession in these small towns. To be fair, this George person really did look like a weirdo, and after having death constantly thrown in my face, there was very little that creeped me out. 

“I know you’re there, William. I didn’t hear you walking away from the door.” I stood there for a minute until a group of women pushing prams walked by the entrance and gave me a squinted look. 

“Alright, George it is.” 

Skipping down the steps—hands tugged into my jacket pockets, hidden from the chilly wind—I heard the door open with a whistling creek. I turned, and cocked my head at the old man—confidence was a requirement. It made them wonder about me being bat-shit rather than knowing it with certainty.

“Miss—” He looked sheepish. His eyes dashed from side to side, my name on the tip of his tongue, but he wasn’t quite sure about it. 

“Rose Smith.” I couldn’t quite remember if this was the name I gave him. I tried to shuffle my aliases around from time to time.

“Miss Smith, I’m going to need proof.”
*****
I came back that very same day and gave him the name of some drunk I caught a whiff of in the bar. His body came in two days later, hit and run. Though nobody knew what he was doing in lying in the middle of a highway at 3am.

William called me up and asked for a meeting to discuss the terms. 

We met at a café on the very opposite side of town. I guess he decided that I was an evil spirit, which is fine by me as long as he didn’t go blurting it out to others. I quite liked this town. Rent seemed on the low to moderate side, and I already attracted a friend of sorts. A dark haired girl, named Hannah, with more piercings than teeth, and a cut up t-shirt that worked at the front desk of the crappy motel I spent the night in.

“Hiding me already, eh Georgy?” I said as I sat down.

His eyes darted around the empty café, and through the windows. He gave me an uncomfortable smile that didn’t quite reach his eyes, and wiped sweat off his forehead with a café serviette. “No, not quite. Miss Smith, but you must know that your . . . *talent* is quite foreign to a good, *church* going man like myself.”

I returned the smile. “Well, a good, church going girl like myself completely understands the reluctance. I’m sure you can imagine how much of a disturbance this *gift* was to my merry life.” 

I saw his eyebrows rise with disbelief and then soften with relief. “You should come to our church! It’s right down the block from the funeral home. You’ll love it.”

I stared at him blankly for a second, wondering why the hell I had to open my mouth. “Great!” I tried my best to sound enthusiastic. I hadn’t been in a church since the eighth grade, and though I wasn’t an *unbeliever*, I was certainly not a big enthusiast either. 

“So, can we get back to business?” I asked once we got our coffee and George stopped ramming on about how the church organized singles dances, and that I’d find myself a healthy, young man in no time. 

“I take a ten percent cut on all bodies that have been predicted by me. There will be no extra cost for the materials I need. That will come out of my cut.”

“Ten percent is very steep, Miss Smith.” He called me Rose when we spoke about the church service. 

“Yes, well, when you start getting clients from all over town, you won’t think so. We can discuss a salary—*which, let’s be clear, was my true intention here*—if that makes you more comfortable, but I need to make a living, Mr. Gray.” 

“No, no. I suppose that will be fine, but I do want to discuss the radius. I don’t think I’ll need your services when the people live right on my doorstep.”

“You never know, Mr. Gray, I hear George has fancier coffins.” I smiled blankly, and took a sip of my coffee, and watched him over the rim of my cup.

His jaw tightened at my response, but he kept his composure. “No commission within the two mile radius. I think you’ll agree that this is fair.”
I nodded, and stood up, extending my hand out toward him. We shook firmly, and I left him with the bill. I could hardly afford crackers at the moment, never mind a double cream cappuccino.

"[WP] You know when people will die, you are a mortician trying to sell caskets.",MonkeyWithAGun42,"There's this thing called synaesthesia where certain individuals are able to hear shapes or taste colors. It's a blending of their senses and their perception of the world is fundamentally different than those around them. I was diagnosed with this when I was 6. They said I associated personalities with color. They were partially right. I associate *something* with color, but it is certainly not personalities. No, it's time of death, and unfortunately the only color I see is grey.

If someone is far from death, I see a grey haze around their face, obscuring their facial features, but as their death draws nearer and nearer, I begin to discern more and more of their face until I can see it perfectly and they are a corpse. I guess I always had trouble communicating with people because of this. On the one hand, I knew when others were talking and could definitely tell when they were agitated or joyful from their voices, but I could never see their faces. There was always a missing element to our conversations. 

That was fine. I could see them clearly when they were dead, so I became a mortician. At least then I could see people for who they truly were, in more ways than one. Because of my unique perception, I was one of the best coffin salesmen in the business. When I saw the whites of their eyes, I knew it was time to shoot them a sale. 

Of course, the locals took notice of my abilities, and because I was a naturally quiet fellow, they associated my voice with the death of their loved ones. I wasn't well liked, but I was certainly needed. Eventually, people just took my word as law. If I wanted to sell to them, they would purchase the coffin and quit their job. At the very least, they knew their death was soon. No one was left guessing.

One afternoon, I was walking down the street, attempting to find new customers when a rather obnoxious man shouted, ""Hey Grim!"" He ran up to me with his blurry face and tubby belly and asked, ""When am I gonna die?""

""You still have some time left."" I said.

""Phew, that's a relief! I thought my wife was going to kill me after today!"" He laughed and his belly jiggled.

I really didn't want to talk to him any longer. I had business to do. ""If you lost your job, she will break up with you, and then you might be a little closer to death."" I chuckled and pushed him aside.

""Wait. Grim. How much closer to death?""

""Look. What's your name? Bob, Billy...?""

""Jake.""

""Ah, yeah, you look like a Jake. I'll call you Billy. You are not going to die soon.""

""Great. Thanks a lot Grim.""

""My name is not Grim.""

""Maybe not, but your expression is."" He began to laugh. I had no idea why. That was the most forced pun I had ever heard.

""Are you a father, Billy?""

""Why yes. Yes, I am."" He pointed a rather chubby finger into the crowd. ""There's my daughter, the love of my life!""

I looked in the direction and saw a little girl with blonde hair and freckles all over her... I could see her face. She had a day or two. So Billy *was* a customer, after all! 

""Hey Billy. I was thinking about it, you might just want a coffin.""

""Haha. *Sure*! You just said I had plenty of time.""

""Oh, *you* do. This coffin would be..."" I didn't know how to break it to him, ""Half price.""

Billy froze. His hands jittered at his sides and he began babbling. ""I... I..."" Slowly the cloud above his shoulders began to rescind. 

I had seen this before. I knew what was about to happen. Slowly but surely, I began to make out more and more features of his face, which seemed all too...

""Grim."" Billy's eyes were diverted to my feet. ""I think I might need two coffins. Today's really not my day.""

“It’s nothing too serious,” the grizzled doctor responded. “Though-”

“Though?”

“Though, I think we’ll need to seriously re-examine your diet.”

“What’s wrong, honey?” 
Mina asked, concerned. Orlok had been staring at dinner for a few minutes now, and she was getting worried. Usually he did this when there was something on his mind.

“Nothing, my love... I just…”
Orlok stared at the bowl in front of him; a salad. “I was a king,” he finally said. “We were royalty. They bowed to me, obeyed my every whim!” he shouted, banging a fist on the table just hard enough to make the silverware jump as he stood. “I commanded armies, watched entire civilizations rise and fall… And this…” he slumped back down into his seat. “This is what I’ve become… Lettuce and cucumbers…” his gaze drifted back to the food.

By this point, Mina had stood up and moved behind him, rubbing his shoulders to try and comfort him. “It’s alright, hun… You’ll always be the king I fell in love with.” She kissed his neck. “Now take your pill before the thirst comes on.”

It loaded up some music [from the old human network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWxBrI0g1kE) and sped along the broken pavement on its tank tracks under smooth electric power. It had an appointment to make.

Rads were at green-yellow, not terrible, in the clearing. Its opponent came over the hill and eased over the the ridge until they were face-to-face, so to speak. They sized each other up.

""Standard Rules"" they communicated over the wireless. ""1000 Quatloos."" ""600."" ""750."" ""7 and final."" It considered for a moment. 700 was a decent haul, but could it come out ahead? It thought of the pods in its belly, what it could profit on for a 700 quatloo wager. It thought it had the right Player for the Game at that wagering level. He did well in Level 2 armor and could probably handle a Level 3 weapon, 500 quatloos to outfit for the Match. Any Machine could put a full Level 10x4 outfit on a Player, armor, weapon, tech, and counter, and those Games were played in many places. But it preferred a more ... organic match. Easy on the outfit. Let the Human, the Player, show his mettle.

""Acceptable."" 700 into the wagering pot. 500 spent on the Outfit.

Deep in its belly its machines turned pods around until the right one lined up to the chute.

The pod shot out onto the playing field and the sharp end staked in the dirt. The shell fell away and the Human inside started to wake up.

It knew it had one of the best, if not the best wake-up program in the region. It had won many Matches, its human being awake just a few seconds before the opponent. But this time, it seemed pretty even, its human and its opponent opened eyes at around the same time, virtual weapons and armor at the ready. It got a read and was surprised to see a 1000 quatloo Outfit on its opponent: Level 3 Armor, Level 3 Weapon, Level 2 Tech and Counter. 

This Match would not be about the wager. 

Its human knew immediately that it was outgunned. But it had chosen well, it was one of its most creative humans, wily with a warrior's heart. Lightly outfitted and with an equal weapon, its human had a speed advantage versus its opponent.

They clashed. And as usual, it was quick: it's human stood victorious over its opponent, it's Virtual Outfit shattered. He had taken minimal damage, which was good too see. It opened a side door, a fresh pod. 

The human's eyes darted over to the tree line. Every time, the allure of freedom, the moment between victory and the return. It made a noise, a sonic thing not over the wireless.

""There is nothing for you in the wild, Human. Return. You have done well.""

The human walked back and entered a fresh pod, which was ingested into the machine.

The accounting had been settled as soon as the Match was over. 1400 quatloos, minus 500 for the Outfit spend, 900 profit. But there was another matter. 

Again over the wireless: ""I will return your wager to you in exchange for your human."" There was something about its opponent that was promising, that it could cultivate and build on. It was its kind of human, and it felt that her potential was being wasted on such a spendy and tech-dependent gamer. 

""Acceptable."" 700 quatloos flowed back. With that, its opponent was done and turned on its tracks back over the ridge.

""You belong to me, now. Come. You will learn many things from me and you will see victory in the Game."" She didn't even bother looking over her shoulder as her old Master tracked away. No love lost as she willingly climbed into a fresh pod.

No profit, but a new Human. The Game would go on.

An ounce of weed in a golden laced leather pouch came in from the window and hit my hand with force. They all thought I planned it, I just accepted it has a lucky break. I never had a ton of friends, but suddenly I was the guy who could get what people wanted. The rest of High School was incredible after that night, I started playing football, turns out I had more talent then I thought. Partying had consumed me by the end because of the booze, drugs, and girls. I wasn't ready to stop using my gift. So I used my football scholarship, applied to one school where I knew I would rule.

This is your epic.",spencethechef101,"I opened the door and instantly was greeted by my half-welcomed housemate, Mark. ""Look at this!"" he shouted out into the hallway from the other room, ""Honestly Toby, you have to watch this, it's so funny!""

I sighed loudly and thought to myself, ""Again, really?"". I  dropped my bag by the door. It was 4am, why the hell was he still up? As I looked up I noticed him sat over on the armchair in the corner of the living room, all the lights were off but I could see him thanks to the glow of the TV light on his dirty pizza-stained body. 

""It better be, if its another damn cat video man I swear to God!"" I was drained today, work was crazy busy and it was my third consecutive split-shift this weekend. But I couldn't complain, I needed the money.

Every time I came back to the flat I was greeted with a variation of Mark exclaiming ""Dude you've got to check this out, it's hilarious"". And, in all fairness he was usually right. About 70% of the time I actually laughed a lot. But recently he'd been showing me so many videos of cats, some jumping in fear from cucumbers, some failing jumps and some just up to no good and knocking things off of tables. It was funny at first I'll admit, but I was just tired of them, really tired.

But not just of the damn cat videos, I was tired of my life here. I needed a big change, and I had done for a while. It needed to happen soon or I was going to sink right back into the depressed slump I was before Mark convinced me to let him crash on my couch while we got super out-of-it at Kayleighs party last month. We met there for the first time, I walked in as he was doing a keg-stand and I was so impressed at how long he managed to do it for I had to tell him afterwards and we got along instantly. He did make me laugh a lot, and I guess we were close too, I was just bored of his latest phase and he really needed to get a job. He was starting to smell gross and the shower was literally up 10 steps, yet he never seemed to use it until I mentioned the smell.

""Nah man it is actually so damn funny! Just watch it, I promise you'll laugh!"" he chucked his phone across the room as I sank down into the couch and reached my hand out to catch it.

""MADMAAAAN"" someone in the street shouted at exactly that moment, probably meeting one of the other college guys out the front.

""DUDE. What the fuck?!"" I didn't even care if the neighbours woke up, even if Paul was an overly-aggressive prick who got upset about everything. I shouted so loud, we were always pranking each other but I was really not in the mood for it tonight, I was too tired.

""Hey calm down you'll wake up that bastard and he'll come down and have a go at us"" he said as he looked up at me for the first time properly, ""You're completely covered in white shit you know.""

""YEAH I fucking know that, you just threw it at me you fuckwit"" at this point I was getting up and shaking myself off, so annoyed at this little shit for this one. How long did he spend making a replica of his phone just for it to explode into powder? How did he even do it, I had to ask. ""How long did you spend on this one anyway you shithead?""

He looked at me, puzzled. ""What are you on about? It looks like you got covered in flour at work."" I did work in a pizza restaurant so that wasn't that unlikely a theory to be fair to him. ""Anyway just watch that video you idiot, pandas are so funny man"" he laughed as he remembered the video.

""You just threw your 'phone',"" I put emphasis on the word phone and did the quote finger action as made famous by Mike Myers in Austin Powers, ""and it exploded powder at me, I'm having a shower and going to bed. And you really need to shower too, I'll get you back for this by the way man don't worry about that"" I said in as sinister a manner as I could.

""Toby I literally threw my phone at you, what are you on about"" he said concerned, looking me up and down. ""If that's not flour then what is it?"" he asked genuinely intrigued.

It was his intrigue that made me believe him, he really did actually throw his phone. I wiped some of the powder off of my forearm with my finger and put it in my mouth to taste it, how else would I know what it was, after all? I would know that acidic taste anywhere, it's cocaine!

""DUDE THIS IS FUCKIN COCAINE, YOU KNOW I HAVE A DRUG TEST SOON YOU ABSOLUTE DICK!"" maybe I shouldn't have shouted so loudly. I heard Paul stirring upstairs. ""SERIOUSLY, HOW WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?!"".

Mark jumped up whilst I was scraping some up off the couch and rubbing my gums, he was shocked at what I'd said but more shocked that it was there and that he knew he hadn't put it there. ""Honestly bro, it wasn't me, but is it good shit?"" he asked as he walked over to where I was sat and gummed his own.

I couldn't deny it, it was the best damn cocaine I'd ever put in my mouth. Admittedly it usually went in my nose so I didn't have much taste-memory as it were for it in my mouth, but I'd dropped some at Kayleighs party last month and only managed to get enough to swab my gums and it tasted the exact same. Before I could even think about what the fuck was happening there was an extremely loud banging at the door. ""TOBY YOU OPEN THIS DOOR RIGHT FUCKING NOW OR I'M CALLING THE POLICE."" Fuck, it was Paul. Me and Mark looked at eachother and decided that it was probably not wise to open the door, given how aggressive he was at the best of times, let alone 4AM on a Monday.

""We'll keep the noise down Paul, I'm sorry"" I shouted, well, I barely shouted, I was far too nervous to get much volume to it. I was covered in cocaine and he wasn't exactly the most understanding guy either. If I opened that door I wouldn't get a chance to explain, not that I could explain anyway.

""I HEARD YOU SHOUT ABOUT COCAINE, I AM CALLING THE POLICE AND KICKING THE DOOR DOWN IN 10 SECONDS"" he screamed back through the letterbox.

""10-"" he had started a countdown to what I assumed would be the biggest ass-kicking I ever received.

""Fuck, Mark, we're gonna have to talk to him aren't we?"" I asked rhetorically.

""9-""

""Yeah man, let's let him in"" he sounded excited more than worried.

""8-""

""I'm going to let you in Paul, just please be calm and let me explain okay?"" I realised as I was walking to the door that the cocaine was very strong, I was not sober. I felt very confident all of a sudden.

""OK, BE QUICK""

I turned the lock on the door and he must've heard the other side as he twisted the handle and pushed through, knocking me to the floor with the force. I guess I was pretty naive not to expect this.

""IS THAT THE FUCKING COCAINE?"" to be fair he couldn't really miss this stuff, I was caked in it. ""YOU'RE COVERED IN COCAINE AND WAKING ME UP 2 HOURS BEFORE I GET UP ON A FUCKING MONDAY MORNING, YOU'RE DEAD MEAT PUNK!"" he screamed so viciously as he leant over to punch me I looked through the doorframe on my right, seeing straight into the living room.

Mark! Paul didn't know he was living here! As I looked I saw him picking up the candlestick holder my mom got me when I moved out, I don't know how she knew that would be useful but it looked like I was gonna have to thank her for that soon. He threw it towards me and I put my hand out to catch it, 'I'll hit him with it while Mark comes over to help' I thought.

""MADMAAAAAANNNN"" that guy shouted for his friend again. Maybe he could help me get Paul off too! I wondered if he could even see me from across the road but not for long, as I stretched my fingers out to wrap around it, I caught it. It felt heavier than I remembered but I didn't have time to think, I had a weapon. And I had to use it quick, as Paul dropped onto me and went to start pummelling my face I hit him on the head and there was a 'smash' sound. He rolled off of me and lay there next to me, blood pooling around his temple where I had hit him. I didn't even hit him hard, I was so confused in that moment.

I looked to my hand and noticed, I didn't have a candlestick holder in my hand, I had a smashed bottle of Budweiser. The big kind, the one you need 2 of to get pissed. But how?

""Toby, what happened?"" Mark said nervously as he arrived on the scene from the living room.

""I-I-I don't know"" I stuttered anxiously, taking in my surroundings I knew straight away, we needed to leave. I was covered in cocaine and Paul lay potentially dying in my hallway after having smashed him on the head with a bottle, I had no case for defense if I called the police. ""Mark, we need to go. Now!"" I climbed up from the floor, still shaking, I was nervous, but also pretty damn high from the coke.

""Yeah, we do. I'll grab your keys and meet you by the car"" he was pretty calm considering what had happened. I walked quickly to the car, not even cleaning myself off, I waited by the door to the drivers side for Mark to bring my keys. I saw him coming and signalled for him to chuck my keys over so we could get the hell outta dodge! He saw my signal and he chucked them over to me.

""MADMAAAAAANNNN"" seriously, this dude was getting annoying now.

""Mark I said throw me my keys. Not a fucking beer"" it was then that I realised. Every time he threw me something, it changed when someone shouted ""MADMAAAAAANNNN"". Then I remembered Kayleighs party, that voice I'd heard three times tonight, it wasn't the first time. When I was doing the keg stand after introducing myself to Mark did his. He was the first to chant it, my new nickname that I'd completely forgotten about, everybody at the party was chanting it and I loved it, and I wished in that moment that I would be the cool 'Madman' guy forever, always the cool guy at parties.

"[WP] You are a hero with a strange power. Every time you raise your hand in a catching position, a voice yells a party nickname for you and a drink or drug tossed into your hand with impressive speed and accuracy. This is your epic.",spencethechef101,"My theory is that it's magic. I don't know how, I don't know why. But hey, free beer.

Let me start over. My name is Michael. Mike to my friends, and I have no idea what I'll be the next time I put my hand up. I am a superhero. I think, at least. I certainly have a super power, but it only became useful during college. I'm a senior now, so I'd like to focus on my classes, but I don't know how to turn it off. But you have to believe me, because trust me, it gets awesome in a second.

So, here goes. When I raise my hand, like if I'm moving to catch something, someone yells a nickname for me, something like ""COWBOY MIKE!"" (I own no cowboy hats or cowboy gear of any kind, so I have no clue where that came from), and then a drink is thrown into my hand with the speed and accuracy of an MLB fastball. It is unreal how fast it goes. The drink varies too, even to drinks that one definitely does not throw. I accidentally raised my hand in chem lab once and caught an appletini, salt and everything. It even had one of those little umbrellas.

It's made me pretty famous around campus, and I even once had a TV crew interview me. I don't think I'll exactly be asked to join Overwatch anytime soon, since they have all have actually useful superpowers, like that superspeed girl with the two pistols. But hey, it's not awful being a minor celebrity. But here's where it gets cool.

So we had a supervillain attack the campus. Like, an honest to god supervillain. He called himself Ferryman, and he was trying to goad Overwatch into a fight by taking hostages. No one wanted to mess with the dude holding two shotguns and seemingly able to produce more from nowhere (probably his superpower, maybe a variation of mine but actually useful), so he managed to take the student center hostage. Of course, since I was stupid, I had my headphones in, and I walked into the student center somehow. And there he was, black robes and all.

I was hung-over at the time, and not really in a mood to deal with anything. It hadn't really made it through my skull that I was facing down a legit supervillain, so I pulled a trick I had mastered during freshman year. I turned around, raised my hand so it lined up with his mask. The voice yelled ""THE MAN, THE MIKE, THE LEGEND"", and I dropped my hand right as I saw the drink. Ferryman got clocked right in the face with a loaded can of PBR.

I guess it was more the surprise of it than any real injury, but he was out cold. Just to make sure, I kicked him in the head a few times. Of course, my luck being as it is, Overwatch rolled up right at that moment, to see me, Michael Ferris, standing over the prone form of a supervillain. The exchange had been caught both on security cameras and several phone cameras.

I received an official commendation from Overwatch ""for my heroic actions in the face of grave danger"". I got to shake the hand of Strike Commander John Marion, which was probably the coolest part of the whole thing. I also got someone's number. I think it was that Egyptian sniper chick, since she introduced herself as Amara when I texted her. I didn't know Overwatch recruited 21 year olds, but apparently they do. We're getting drinks in about 15 minutes, so I gotta go.

Moral of the story, kids, even if your superpower is useless, you might get lucky. Keep at it, learn the ins and outs, maybe you'll get somewhere. Like me.",skyknight01

It had been long since the temperatures would allow for leisurely strolls, but as usual in their frigid little town, the warmth came quickly with the season. Around them were fir trees, green and warm like the sun on their backs, frozen ground thawing beneath them. Beautiful in the way only forests are beautiful.  

""Thank you.. for dragging me out"" Geoffrey said quietly, eyeing the treeline from their dirt trail. ""No problem, bud. Me and Jodey's been worried about you. We've barely seen you in town for months. You've become a hermit. What've you been doing in that cabin of yours?"" Ethan replied in his usual friendly tone. He tried to give Geoff a quick pat on the shoulder, immediately causing him to recoil.  


""Bud?"" he asked, surprised. ""Sorry. I guess I'm just twitchy. Been on my own for a while, uh, working on my novel."" Geoffrey said dismissively. ""Your novel? Well.. that's great. You've talked about it for so long, I'm glad you got motivated to start."" Ethan replied incredulously. They walked for a while like that, letting the warmth and the birds beckon them on, taking in the green all around them. Geoffrey slowed and ran his fingers through his unkempt beard. ""Actually, man.. I've gotta tell you something. Something.. happened to me a few months ago. And I need you to believe me."". Ethan stopped with him, eyeing him curiously. ""What 'something'? he asked. Geoffrey took a deep breath and half-way looked like he was about to start crying. ""You're not going to believe me unless I show you."" he continued. Not waiting for a reply, Geoffrey raised his hand and pointedly looked into the other direction. ""Geoffrey, what a-"" Ethan started. ""G-MAN!"" someone yelled. And just like that, an impossibly cool beercan with beads of frost slammed into Geoffrey's hand, perfectly palming it. Ethan spun, scanning the trees for the thrower. There was nothing. No one. He turned back to Geoffrey, who now had tears running down his cheeks. 

""Who the fuck was that? Ethan asked. ""I don't know, man"" Geoffrey sobbed in reply. ""3 months ago I went to get firewood when I thought I saw movement in the sensor lights outside my dad's cabin. When I put my hand over my eyes to see better, someone yelled out ""Geoffster"" and a fucking beercan slammed into my hand, scaring the shit out of me. I grabbed my rifle and looked for close to an hour. I couldn't find anyone, man. There was no one! It happened again a week after that. I went outside after writing for hours and I tried to stretch.. Then again. Voice, nickname, beercan. So... I tried it again. But it wouldn't work, until I looked in the other direction. Then I.. I tried it again next to my car so I could see in the window reflection and... I'm telling you man, there was someone there. I can never catch them but I think I'm haunted by an alcoholic baseball pitcher or some shit."". 

Geoffrey looked at Ethan for a long time, pleading desperation in his eyes. ""I need you to be ready and look when it happens Ethan. Tell me I'm not crazy."". Ethan felt like saying something, but instead nodded at his dishevelled friend, for the first time noticing the bags under his eyes. ""Just look over there, alright? Look closely."" Geoffrey said. Then he slowly raised his hand, palm facing the direction Ethan was looking in, and opened his fist. ""Geoff-rod!"". Geoffrey immediately dropped the can and turned to Ethan. ""Well?"". Ethan still looked in the direction the voice had come from, pale and wide-eyed. And then he started running.

Another strong gust would push him over, sending him hundreds of feet below into the icy depths of the Trenton River.

I sighed. Another day, another job.

Serendipity is the superhero name I chose for myself. Nobody else knows it. Why not? Well, I don't know about you, but I don't have the money or know-how to sew my own fucking superhero costume. I don't have super strength, or super speed, or the power of flight, or telekinesis. As such, I've gotta protect myself and my identity. 

It's not that I believe some supervillain is gonna get me - it's just that I don't want to have to deal with the feds. I would've named myself Anonymous, but I'd rather not associate myself with the dipshits on 4chan.

Anyway, I forgot to tell you what my power actually is. Silly me.

About two years ago, I was out on the school baseball diamond playing catch with my friend. I'd just gotten a new glove and had been dying to test it out. I threw the ball to her, punched my mitt a few times, and raised it to catch her return throw. 

Before the ball met my hand, I heard someone yell, ""Rooter! This is comin' to you, bud!""

I whipped my head around, my body and arm turning with it, and a small, soft package landed in my mitt. Just before I could see who threw me the item, or what it even was, the baseball my friend threw thunked me in the head.

It knocked me out.

When I came to, my friend was shaking me urgently.

""Dude! Avery, dude!""

""...Fuck,"" I groaned, embarrassed that I'd taken my eye off the ball and paid the price for it.

""Dude, why the fuck did you bring that to school? Put it away!""

I looked up at her in confusion, and then down at my mitt, where she was looking. Inside it was a small bag filled with a fine white powder. Flour? 

I opened it up and put my finger in. It didn't feel like flour, and even though the thought was ridiculous, I immediately knew what it was.

""Is that... fucking cocaine?"" I asked incredulously to no one in particular.

I stashed the bag in my pocket and tried to explain myself to my friend, but she wasn't having any of it. I lost a friend that day, but I gained something new.

Serendipity.

So yeah, there you have it. For some fucking reason, every time I raise my hand to catch something, somebody, somewhere, yells one of my nicknames and a drug or drink is thrown into my hand. Doesn't matter when or where, or how the law of physics would permit it. 

Quite frankly, I stopped caring a while ago. Unlimited free booze will do that to you.

***

""Just what I needed after a long day,"" I said to myself with fake enthusiasm. I massaged the bridge of my nose and inhaled deeply. ""This fucker better be thankful.""

I raised my hand, and right on cue, someone yelled, ""Stick! Heads up!"" With reflexes honed over the past two years, my fingers closed over yet another soft bag.

It was filled with pre-rolled joints.

""All I wanna do is smoke a little chronic,"" I half-sang to myself, quoting the Biggie Smalls tune. I flicked on my lighter and took a deep hit. Suicides were always tough.

The weed hit me quick and hard as I strolled over to the railing on the side of the bridge and swung my legs over. The man standing at the edge turned his head and saw me, surprise registering in his eyes.

""Who... who're you?"" he asked. ""You don't look like a cop.""

""I'm not a cop,"" I replied, grinning. ""Fuck the police.""

My response must've startled him.

""Then... who are you?""

""I am the walrus,"" I replied, quoting Donnie from The Big Lebowski. The man continued to look confused. I chided myself for continuing my habit of quoting lines from my favorite songs and movies that most people didn't pick up on.

""Kidding. I'm just an average every day citizen of this fine town, and I was wondering why you're standing here,"" I said.

""Why do you think?"" the man laughed, bitterly shaking his head. ""I'm 54, I lost my job, my wife's cheating on me, and my son hates me. There's nothing left to live for.""

""Shiiiiiiit,"" I said, half in response to his situation, half in response to the wave of high that rolled over my body. This was some good weed.

""Yeah, you can say that again,"" he muttered morosely.

""Shiiiiiit,"" I said. ""Well, why not take a puff before your tragic demise?"" I offered him the joint in my hand.

""I've never smoked weed before,"" he replied, cautiously eyeing it.

""You've also never killed yourself before. Right? First time for everything, man,"" I laughed, shrugging. I prayed to myself that this would work.

""Fair enough.""

The man reached over and gingerly took the lit joint from my hand, sucking on it a bit and coughing.

""Do it softer than that, dude,"" I said. I couldn't help but chuckle.

The man tried again, this time getting a good lungful of smoke before he started to cough violently.

""Oh shit, nice hit."" 

I took the joint from his hand and took another hit. Damn, this was good weed. The man kept on coughing as I tried to blow smoke rings in the blustering wind.

I leaned back against the railing, and my heart leapt as the man mirrored my actions. I hadn't looked down this whole time, but I didn't want to think about falling hundreds of feet to my death. I get free drugs whenever I want, but I wouldn't survive anything like that.

The man turned to me, his eyelids a little heavy, his eyes a little red. He had a goofy half-grin on.

""This makes me feel funny,"" he chortled.

""That's kinda the point, man,"" I said. ""Anyway, tell me about this bitch of a wife you have.""

""Well... Hey, what's your name?""

""Avery.""

""Well, Avery, she's not really a bitch. She's just lonely, I guess. She tells me I work too much and-""

I interrupted him. ""Being lonely isn't a justifiable reason to cheat, dude. Sorry. Continue.""

The man seemed thoughtful for a moment, and forged on.

""Well, she said I worked too much, and that I wasn't filling her needs. So she had a fling with a younger guy from her work.""

""Fuckin' bitches, man. Can't trust these hoes,"" I said, hoping he'd pick up on the slang I was using.

He laughed again.

""Yeah, I guess not,"" he said. ""She was kind of annoying anyway. And she'd never give me a blowjob.""

I guffawed, surprised at his last statement. I tried to stop and make some witty remark, but the weed took its hold on me, and soon I was laughing so hard tears were forming in my eyes. The man seemed like he couldn't help but laugh either, and soon we were both doubled over on the side of a bridge hundreds of feet above a churning, over-polluted river, sharing a joint and watching thousands of people pass us by without a second glance.

We continued on, just laughing, and pausing, and then bursting into laughter again until the sun began to dip below the horizon.

""Damn, that's really cool,"" the man said, watching the giant burning ball of gas's rays illuminate our atmosphere in hues of pink and purple.

""Yeah man,"" I said, taking another hit of the joint. **Damn**, this was some good weed.

""Hey Avery?"" the man asked. I turned to him.

""Yeah?""

""I'm really hungry.""

I smiled and reached over to smack his shoulder. ""Let's go get something to eat, man.""

"[WP] Write a story of murder, betrayal, and deceit-- but write it in a child-friendly way",therealggamerguy,"Alex was a big kid, almost a grown-up. He glared across the driveway where another big kid, almost a grown-up had kidnapped his little sister, Lizzie. Lizzie was a medium-sized kid. She was too big for Santa Claus or the Tooth Fairy but she was still too little for high school.

""You big meany! You kidnapped my little sister! I had come home from college to surprise her for her birthday and you spoiled it! Meany! Give me back my Lizzie!""

Lizzie was tied up with jump ropes and the Meany had just finished tying her toes to his basketball net. Lizzie was upside down and was starting to get dizzy.

""She was all alone when I found her!"" The Meany shouted in his outside-voice. ""Finders keepers, losers weepers, crawly creepers!""

The Meany picked up his best creepy-crawly out of the big fish tank he kept them in. It was a huge tarantula named Kevin the Tarantula. Lizzie screamed really, really loudly, so that Alex had to cover his ears. The Meany placed Kevin the Spider on top of Lizzie's bare feet. Well, because Lizzie was upside down, Kevin the Tarantula was actually on the bottoms of her feet, but you know what I mean. Kevin the Tarantula crawled around the bottoms of Lizzie's feet and Lizzie began to laugh. 
Lizzie had always been super-duper ticklish--anytime Alex wanted her to give him the remote for the tv, or let him play his video games, or give him her ice cream, he would tickle her and then Lizzie would give him anything he wanted.

""Eeny meeny miney moe. Catch a Lizzie by the toe. If she hollers--""

""LET HER GO!""

""No! I don't wanna!""

Lizzie giggled and then screamed and then giggled and then screamed. 

""Let me go, please? Pretty please?""

""No way! I have Kevin the Tarantula and a bunch of other creepy-crawly friends."" The Meany picked up a giant earthworm named Albert the Worm. ""Albert wants to play too!""

""Get away!"" Lizzie tried to squirm away, but the knots tying her toes to the basketball net were too high for her to reach. The Meany put Albert the Worm in between Lizzie's big toes. Kevin the Tarantula began crawling again; Lizzie began to giggle again and then Albert the Worm slid out of her toes and fell to the ground and went splat! Poor Albert the Worm...

""Meany! I'm going to beat you up!"" Alex began stomping over to where Meany and Lizzie were. Meany didn't look scared at all. He looked like the kid at the arcade who only played against littler kids he knew he could beat. Alex looked very angry, like how Mommy does when you don't clean up the litter box. Lizzie had been upside down for so long, her face was redder than a fire truck. 

""Just try and beat me up! I have all my creepy crawlies!"" Meany held out a big beetle. ""Meet Donny the Beetle!""

""Well I brought my Super-frog! And he eats creepy crawlies!"" Alex pulled a very big frog out of his pocket and then Super-frog jumped up and ate Donny the Beetle right up. Super-frog jumped on top of Meany's head and then jumped into the big fish bowl. There were a bunch of other creepy crawlies but Super-frog ate them all up.

""You stink! You and your stinky Super-frog ate up all my creepy crawlies! You cheated! I'm telling!"" Meany began to cry like a big, fat baby.

""Oh, yeah? If you tell on me, I'll tell on you about stealing Lizzie and tying her up!""

""Can someone let me down now? I wanna go home. My toes are sore and my head hurts and Kevin the Tarantula won't stop walking on me.""

""I forgot all about you,"" Meany grinned widely, like he had the answers to the spelling test but wouldn't share unless you gave him your favorite comic. ""Okay, Mr. Alex, you win. You're the bestest. But how about a deal? If you don't tell on me, and don't beat me up, I'll let you draw on Lizzie's face with a marker! You can tell your mommy and daddy she got a tattoo and then she'll get in big, big trouble!""

Alex thought about it, but he didn't make deals with Meanies. He stuck his tongue out. ""No way! Nobody tells me when I can and can't pick on Lizzie."" Alex began untying Lizzie from the basketball hoop. He picked up Kevin the Tarantula.

""Don't hurt him!"" Lizzie pleaded. ""Kevin the Tarantula isn't a Meany. Meany just bought him from the pet store. And Super-frog ate up all his friends and family so he's all alone.""

""He crawled all over you and made you scream!""

""Kevin didn't mean it though. He was only walking around! Let's keep him! He can live with Billy and Bonnie and Betty and Binky the Hermit Crabs!""

""Okay, that sounds like fun!""

""What about me?!""

""You're a Meany, Meany! Meanies shouldn't have pets, especially not nice ones like Barney!""

""What?! Barney?! His name is Kevin the Tarantula!""

""All my pets have names that start with the letter 'B.' It's my second favorite letter. And besides, this can be your punishment for stealing me!""

Alex and Lizzie walked back across the street to their house. Meany threw a huge temper tantrum and wasn't paying attention and then he threw the empty fish tank and it broke into a million pieces and then his daddy came home but all the fish tank pieces made Meany's daddy get four flat tires so Meany was sent to military school where he never bothered anybody again.

Alex and Lizzie and Barney the Tarantula lived happily ever after. The end.",CryptidGrimnoir
"[WP] Write a story of murder, betrayal, and deceit-- but write it in a child-friendly way",therealggamerguy,"""Daddy, why does Fido look sick?"" my daughter asked me one warm, July night.

I looked at the dark brown mutt in the corner. It sat down on all four paws, with a lame expression in the eyes. Big eyes that stared vacantly at the tall white fence on the other neighbor's house. Nights like this, Fido loved to just hop and bound around, running from tree to tree across the yard.

The last time I remembered something like that, I think I was getting married.

""Well, he's an old dog, Jane. Old dogs just happen to look sick.""

""Will Fido get better soon, Daddy?""

There was a lump in my throat. She looked at me with a queer look on her expression, lit by the faint glow of a yellow night-lamp at her bedside. 

""... Right. I've had the old dog with me for about twenty-seven years until today He's not leaving anytime soon.""

""But, I heard Mommy say that he needs to be taken to the hospital. That he's sick and too old and in suppering? That he needs to be err... puddown?""

""Suppering?"" I asked, ""Puddown?""

""Suppering,"" Jane repeated. ""Puddown,"" she said again. ""Why does a dog need to supper, daddy?""

Sweat beaded down my brow. It wasn't because of the heat because it didn't feel hot. I was pretty sure that I was sweating at the time. I was certainly, almost definitely sweating.

""Daddy?"" Jane raised an eyebrow at me.

""What's that?"" I asked, forgetting the question.

""It's just that,"" she seemed to want to raise her hand and point at something. Like she always did when something seemed off or strange to her, ""Nevermind. I wanted to ask what Mommy meant when a dog is in suppering and needed to be puddown?""

""It just means that Fido might  be going away for a while. So, you might not get to see him for a long time.""

""Ohhh,"" she said, as if she understood what I meant, ""How long is a long time?""

""Very long,"" I replied. I weaved my fingers through locks of her hair, stroking them gently.

""Daddy, you got snot in your nose,"" Jane said.

I grabbed a tissue off her nightstand and blew harshly into it. It was probably some kinda virus. It was certainly some kind of virus.

""I suppose I do,"" I replied.

""Is a long time as long as the trip to Granma's house?"" she asked.

I smiled weakly, ""Longer than that. Go to sleep, Jane.""

I flickered off the the lamp and made my way out of the room. Jane said one last thing. She sounded a bit more tired than earlier though. 

""I'm going to see Fido after he's gone, right Daddy?""

""Yeah. Yeah, you will,"" I said, and closed the door.

It was about ten o'clock at this time. I was feeling hungry, so I went to the fridge and poured myself some milk. I always did this sorta thing when I was sad as a kid. Helped me feel better.

I drank the milk while staring at Fido outside. Milk didn't help anymore. Milk nowadays tastes too salty and like snot. It was definitely the milk that had gone bad. It was certainly the milk that had gone bad.

 I don't like it one bit.

...

I don't like crying one bit.

"[WP] Write a story of murder, betrayal, and deceit-- but write it in a child-friendly way",therealggamerguy,"Once upon a time there was a princess who wanted to fly. She'd stand on the walls of the castle and raise her arms to the sky. She would sing to the wind, asking that it take her away, but the wind that came only swirled about her. Still, the princess would close her eyes and dream that the air tossing her skirts and blowing across her arms was what held her, not a stone wall. 

Her father, the king, knew she only wished to fly, but he did not want that wish to come true. He loved his daughter so much that the thought of her flying terrified him. Flying almost always meant falling, so he forbid her from going on the wall and told her that in three days she must pick who she would marry. If she did not choose her husband, then he would chose for her.

The next day, the princess was kept in the castle. There, she met three suitors. The first was a knight so strong he had slain a dragon with his bare hands. She wished she had met the dragon, for it might have carried her away from the hard seat and staring eyes. The second was a prince so fair that the birds themselves would sing his praises. She wished they would listen to her so, for then they might lift her above the crowds and out into the sunshine. The third was a wizard so powerful, he could make entire armies fall to their knees. She asked if he could help her fly, but he only laughed until the sound of it echoed through the Great Hall. 

All three men wanted her to be theirs. They boasted of their might, told her she was beautiful, and gave her gifts in heavy gold. Still, the princess only smiled politely and watched the wind blow the clouds past the windows. 

That night, while the castle slept, the princess crept from her bed, went up on the wall, and raised her arms to the wind. She sang her song so achingly that the spirit of the wind came to listen, and he wept at the pain in her voice. 

""Princess,"" he said, ""why do you sing such sorrow?""

""I am to marry a man who I do not love, and he will never let me fly,"" she told him.

""I wish I could help you,"" the wind told her sadly, ""but people do not belong to the sky.""

""Please,"" she begged, ""is there nothing I can do?""

The wind thought for three breaths, awed by the soul he saw inside her. This was a soul meant for flying. ""Your heart is pure and your voice is true. This night and this day, I will carry your song to the sky and ask that it welcome you. Return to the wall at tomorrow's eve, and I will bring you its reply.""

The princess thanked him, and the wind lifted her song, brushing her cheek as he passed.  

The next day, the princess glowed. Her father smiled to see her happiness, thinking she had at last given up her foolish dreams; her suitors each puffed up with pride, thinking they were the reason for the lightness in her step. At last, the sun began to lower.

The princess stood by the windows at the end of the Great Hall with her three suitors before her. When she spoke, the air itself went still to hear her. ""I thank you for the gifts you gave, and the offers you made, but my hand I will not give. Today, the sky has heard my song, and tonight it might take me away.""

The crowds murmured, the king gasped, and the suitors shook with anger. 

""Do not be a fool,"" said the first. ""Do not mock us so,"" said the second. ""Do not toss us aside like scum,"" said the last, and their voices jumbled together, clashing like thunder. But her father saw her heart and his own understood. 

""Very well,"" said the king, and when the princess leapt to hug him, the crowd would have sworn she flew to his arms, and all hearts melted at the sight. All hearts but three.

The castle celebrated. Tonight, their princess would hear the answer to her wish, and they toasted for her luck. As the sun began to set, they followed the princess to the wall. She rose up the stairs, higher and higher, and her song burst from her heart. It was to those who heard it the soul of their wishes, rising to the wind. And the wind sang back. His voice was one of promise, of freedom, of hope. They knew this was her answer, and all cheered to hear him coming. All but three.

The princess went to take the final step onto the wall, and slipped. The stone under her feet was slick with oil. She reached for a hold, but found none, and tried to catch her balance, but the stones shifted like waves on the ocean. She fell.

The spirit of the wind saw, and he raced to her. He had carried her song to the sky, and it had spoken in welcome, but even the sky could not take one of the ground without help from the wind. The wind rushed so quickly, birds were thrown from the air, trees tore from their roots, and the wall broke where it stood. But when he reached her, she was on the ground.

""Princess,"" he cried, and his voice cracked the stones around them. 

His answer was the echoes of her song of hope and longing. Trembling, the world watched as the wind knelt. From the dirt and the stone, he picked her up, and in gentle arms, he carried her to the sky.

If you listen, even now, you can hear her song. It flies forever on the wind.",thecoverstory

As the airlock opened, I gasped. ""...Oh my god! Look at how cute they are! I just want to eat them up they're so cute.""

As a nearby human heard me say ""eat them up"", the entire flock started running. I tried to explain that it was simply a figure of speech, but they wouldn't listen. But one stayed. One decided not to run from the thing that supposedly threatened to eat it.

""Hi! I hope you didn't take what I said too literally..."" I said to the human. It looked back at me and replied ""Sorry, I'm a little shy... What's your name?"" I told him, ""My name is X12-482, captain of this ship."" He looked back up at me and said ""You're a lot less scary then I thought you would be."" I was pleased. And I still can't believe how cute they are.

Another human approached me. He looked at me with surprise for a few seconds, then pulled something out of his pocket. I then heard clicking coming from this flat touch-activated... thing. I looked at it and I saw a few words: ""Emergency Call"". 

A few minutes pass, and I see what I believe to be the human leader. He is dressed in armor that reads ""FBI"". As I wave, I feel something poke into my shoulder. ""Hey, did you just do som......""

What? Well, yes, they're technically poisoning their habitat and killing off almost every other species by their very existence, but get this: *they decorate their bodies!*

Why?! What do you mean, why?! For the sheer joy of it, that's why! Especially the females of the species; they love to adorn themselves and it's so precious and lovely!

Well, yes, sometimes it is about a mating display, but not always. OH!! and their vocalizations-----they can't join the GodMind so they vocalize to express their desires and needs and intentions. Sometimes for no reason at all but for sheer joy they'll vocalize harmoniously----they call this singing and it's so wonderful to hear. Sometimes groups of them gather to listen to one of their own saying 'jokes'; which are vocalizations that express a surprising paradox which gives one pleasure. Here is an example of a joke: What do you tell a woman----this is what they call their females---with two black eyes (some of them have black eyes, some have green, or blue, or brown, or pedipalp-colored; so unique!) ? 

Answer: nothing, you already told her twice! And then you make a loud repeated vocalization to express your surprise and delight at the humor. 

*Of course* you don't get it; you weren't down there! *You* didn't get to hold one of their younglings and see it smile at you and pat your mandible and call you 'Kitty'. *You* haven't observed the care with which the females----and even some of the males!--attend their young. You didn't get to see the way they come together to support one another, and how brave they are despite their smallness and squishy bodies. 

It's decided, Gruuukkll; we're getting one. As soon as the transfer of power is complete and they're brought in line with GodThought, we're going to get a human for our very own. I want to dress it and hold it and name it Martha. ",Fidesphilio

Not time to pick them yet, but I like to watch them and imagine that I can see them growing. The sun moves across the sky as I stand in vegetable contemplation. Hm. Coming along very nicely.

I walk down the gravel path away from the garden towards my little home on the edge of town, but I don't make it far. A man comes up the street and offers me some feathers. Wonderful. I am a fletcher after all and chickens are in short supply at the moment. They have a tendency to run off. I hand the man an emerald and grunt appreciatively. Hm. A fair price.

I reach the end of the gravel path and there stands my house. It's lovely, with its own backyard and the oak fence and lots of windows to let in natural light. My friend the librarian has come over, perhaps to borrow some feathers for writing in his books. We meet awkwardly at the doorway. Hm. Please, you first.

Night is falling by the time we decide who is first to cross the threshold, and not a moment too soon. We know that to be outside during the night is to enter a world of horror and despair. The librarian, suddenly aware of the failing twilight, quickly turns around again to take refuge. The moon is now rising. We peer out of the windows as our nightmares begin to take shape. Hm. Now we must wait.

A putrid corpse smashes against the door, breathing heavily and groaning. The door begins to splinter. Surely we are doomed. And then I hear a twang and the zombie is thrown backwards by the force of the bolt that plunges into its chest, but the creature is too stupid to register pain. Another twang, and the zombie falls to the ground, leaving no trace but a puff of smoke and some glowing orbs. They linger on the ground for a moment, before flying off into the night. I turn my head to follow their path and I see them absorbed by the man who I traded with earlier! Hm. Who is this brave warrior?

I watch as his sword flashes blue and gleaming out of its sheath and brings down a skeleton in a clatter of bones, before he whirls and strikes a spider that had just come down hissing from the roof. Smoke and orbs fly as the man leaves a brutal trail of destruction in his wake. Around the town he goes, fighting on the paths and on the gardens and the roofs of the houses, seemingly invincible. By the time the horde has been beaten back, it is nearly morning. Hm. My carrots are in ruins.

As soon as day breaks I run out of my house to thank him but I find myself speechless. The man seems to understand, placing his blade back in his sheath and taking a hoe from his sack. To my gratitude, he picks the rest of the carrots and sows the fields once more. I then watch as he takes a pickaxe and shovel, and begins to repair the damage done from the night's battle. He even spends the afternoon building a new house, and filling in a sinkhole which had recently opened up in our town. Hm. Perhaps we could convince him to stay?

I go around to the other villagers and ask if they think it's a good idea. This takes a while, as some of them have gotten into some very tight spaces and there's a lot more awkward encounters in doorframes. Meanwhile the man has been moving at breakneck pace to build a city wall, and smoke rises from the furnaces that growl and glow day and night to smelt the iron ore that he brings from our nearby mine, that we had long since abandoned, thinking it exhausted. Hm. Did I leave my records in the minecart?

The villagers eventually concede to let the man stay, as he has improved the place immensely. Most of them affirm my suggestion with a hm. Mostly these improvements are for his benefit, but to be fair, the village is a lot safer with the wall. There's even a clever automatic gate. I finally approach the man and offer him my family heirloom, an ancient and enchanted bow, in a bid to show him that he is welcome forever as our village's champion. Hm. He considers the proposal.

Suddenly he breaks mid conversation and runs back to his house and I realise that he's forgotten his emeralds. He has little reason to buy things from us these days. And then, as I stand pensively in the path waiting for him to return, a blast rocks the town and his house explodes. Items come raining down, torches, flowers, saplings, bits of pork, and even some feathers which I am ashamed to say I tucked into my tunic. Blown apart by a creeper. Hm. Such a sad way to go.

The man doesn't come back, and the villagers agree that his spawn point must have been reset somehow. You should always know where home is. And sleep in your bed as soon as you make it. Perhaps he will find his way back to us one day. Hm. Long live the man with shining white eyes. Hm. Our beloved Herobrine.",TeddyArmy

Your sole task now, is to find out who the main character is, and assist them in their story.",Lakuri_Bhanjhyang,"For years and years, I trained. “You will be the best warrior the realm has ever seen,” my mother told me. By the Gods, was she wrong.
 
But still, I believed her. I trained for hours on end. Trained until my arms fell beneath the weight of my sword and shield. And when I was done, I rested, only to return the following day. Soon everyone in town knew my name. They told stories of my victories in front of the fire at the inn. 

It wasn’t enough for me.
    
I left town to make a name for myself. I began by making my way to a nearby village, where I searched for the deadliest task they had to offer. At the center of the town, an old woman cried hysterically about the return of mythical monsters. *Yeah, Okay,* I though as I ignored her and continued into the trader. Inside, the owner of the shop complained of a robbery. He said his precious family heirloom had been stolen by a pack of thieves who were held up in a nearby ruin. It was perfect. I could already hear the stories they would sing to celebrate me, the brave woman who easily put an end to their bandit problem.  

Wasting no time, I climbed the snowy steps and, from the shadows, I laid waste their lookouts. Their iron swords and fur armor were no match for my steel. I slayed bandit after bandit as I pressed on into the crypt, which was surprisingly well lit. Soon the bandits were replaced by skeletons and other undead creatures, who put up even less of a fight.

Finally, I found the leader of the bandits captured on a wall of webs. He begged and cried for me to free him, so I cut him down, and found the golden trinket on his corpse. As I turned towards the exit, I heard the haunting clicks that came from the ceiling. Before I could turn my head, the giant spider descended onto me from the ceiling, knocking my shield across the rocky room. I fought bravely, but I was no match for the creature. I felt my body begin to slow as its venom entered my body. I ducked my head and closed my eyes, awaiting death. I lived my life without fear. I knew what awaited me in the afterlife.

Instead of dying from the final blow, I fell to my knees. I was defeated but I could not die. The spider turned away and ignored me all the same.

The stories were true.

In all the legends of great heroes, there was always a faithful companion that followed them on their mission. They were revealed by their remarkable aversion to death. They would always arise moments after they had been slain. Some say they were blessed by the Gods, but I know better than anyone. This is a curse. 

I rose from the ground and was attacked again. I fell, rose, and fell again. For hours the cycle repeated until I finally killed that unholy spider. I contemplated my new-found power as I returned to the village and collected my reward. I decided to return home and wait until my great hero finally revealed himself.

In the meantime, I joined the City Guards. I made my way through the ranks. I was unstoppable. When the bandits raided, none of them could get through the gate when I stood at the entrance. Eventually, I reached the highest rank and feasted among the Jarl himself in his hall. But it was all meaningless. All my accomplishments served some higher purpose that was not my own.

One day I awoke to a deathly roar. I exited into the streets, where the town people fled. “A Dragon,” they yelled. I ran to the outskirts of the town to the far watchtower. There, among the smoke and embers, I saw it. The massive beast lay slain at the center of the destruction. Nothing remained of it but its bones. Those massive, heavy bones that I would come to dread. Was this my destiny? To be endlessly tortured by such horrors. 

I climbed the steps to the great hall at the peak of the city. I heard the Jarl congratulate the great hero from the end of the hall. “I assign you Lydia as a personal housecarl,” he began. I froze in my tracks, too angry to hear the rest. He was as fresh as spring grass, and just as green. His armor was iron. His boots made of fur. I couldn’t believe it. I wouldn’t accept it. I worked so hard for so long. Now I was meant to serve this “hero”? I refused to be a slave of my fate. I opened my mouth to deny him my service.

“The Jarl has appointed me to be your housecarl,” I said against my will. “It’s an honor to serve you.” 

He looked at me unimpressed. Then handed me the bones of the dragon he had somehow slain. I still remember how my breath left my body the first time I held those dense bones. What in oblivion had I done to deserve this?

“I am sworn to carry your burdens,” I said dreadfully. He would have my servitude, but he would not have my gratitude.

My powers in magic and weaponry were unsurpassed by anyone in the realm. Because of this, and my bad behavior, my treasonous acts have caused a lot of attention towards my name. I always hated the name my mother gave me, it always sounded too evil.


I was bored, so one day I walked into the royal palace and slaughtered the king and his puppets. I binded his arms and legs with fleshy chains to his stupendous golden chair, while making his family watch in horror. Well, someone is going to have to spread the news.  


Summoning the dead was just as easy, all I needed was a good amount of corpses and a quiet place to work. I had walked up to the crypt in hopes of finding some victims, maybe an adventurer or two. 


Making my way through the rotten graveyard was simple, I avoided the traps and summoned the dead when I saw fit. Some were great warriors sent to rest, others were foolish adventurers seeking to find a name for themselves. Then the minority were the silly mortals who thought they were destined for greatness. I didn't even bother resurrecting them. 


Strolling through the crypt, I had almost made it to the grand hall when I heard a loud clank behind me. I shrugged it off, guessing that one of my skeletons decided to throw a bone or something. Although in my peripheral vision, I saw that their were no skeletons behind me. I paced around the room, trying to figure out what was going on. My spell couldn't have been so short!?? I may not be good at keeping it up, but I-


""I shall defeat you, necromancer!"" 


""What?"" 

I turned around and saw the boy stand there, eager and confident, with his sword drawn aiming towards my throat. 
""HAHHHAAAHAHAAH!"" I cackled at him. A foolish adventurer thinks he can outdo the lord of the undead!?? Who does he think he i-


The boy let loose a bewildering spark of energy, as it homed in at me. I dodged out of the way, but the sizzling magic cackled back at my attempt to leave its gaze. The energy dispersed into the air to create a massive explosion which took up the whole room. 


I brought myself back up, the whole room afire, and stared at the boy with bursts of magic emanating from his eyes. 


""I AM THE HERO OF THE REALM, AND I SHALL FIGHT BACK AGAINST THE DEAD AND THE WICKED TO SAVE THE LIVING!"". This boy was unreal. His power, nothing like anything I have every seen before. His immense potential at such a young and innocent age drove me mad with jealousy.  


""This isn't over yet, 'hero' of the realm. We shall meet again.....and next time it won't be as easy...."". With that I vanished from the crypt and journeyed back towards my castle. That kid....'hero' my ass. He better prepare soon, because I'm already thinking off a plan to put him and this whole realm back in their place.

I was sitting in my small office, tired of my middle of the work week blues.  I had dazed in and out while on my computer, that I now found myself just staring out my window.  I had grown tired of the mundane life that I lead.  It was the same thing week in and week out, not that I could remember much past the last week.  It was so boring, that there really wasn’t much to remember.  As far as I could recall, this office building, my small apartment, and the city between it was my life.  

Though, looking back, I had started noticing a few discrepancies here and there.  There was an uptick in what seemed to be criminal offenses, with news reports being more and more frequent.  The police had definitely been a lot more active lately, you could always hear sirens around the city.  I’d hear my co-workers talking about some crazy guy running swerving through traffic or some car chase on the freeway.  It seemed pretty exciting in all honesty.  The city just seems dead some days.

Looking outside, it seemed like a pretty nice day, so I figured I’d go out for lunch.  I had a favorite spot in the city, about 15 minutes from my office.  It was a small café, with just about everything on the menu being quite delicious.  I typically went with a turkey crepe load with mushrooms and cheese.

“Yup, that crepe is just calling to me.  Oooh, and a smoothie would go great…”

“OH MY GOD!!!!”

The thoughts that had been driven by my stomach suddenly were interrupted.  My mind had been elsewhere when the sound of sirens came barreling down from the street.  They sounded as if in hot pursuit of a black sedan that was now weaving its way between cars and pedestrians.  Paint and sparks flew everywhere as the driver bounced off other cars and even a light pole, flipping the sedan a couple times before landing upright.  The driver got out of the car, a ridiculous fellow who was quite tall with bright green hair, looking very much like the Jolly Green Giant, and pulled out an assault rifle.  He waited patiently with his gun drawn, propped up against the hood of the automobile while the sirens grew louder and louder.

“*What the fuck….*”  I thought to myself

The sirens drew closer and closer and I seemed to be the only person in the general vicinity, who was not the aforementioned driver, standing and watching and not running for my life.  As a pair of police cruisers rounded the corner, the driver now turned shooter fired a pair of shots each into the corresponding cars.  They both spun out of control towards the sidewalk, taking out more light poles.

*I never knew how delicate lamp posts were.*

A single officer got out of the car and began yelling at the man with the rifle, not the smartest of ideas I immediately knew.  A quick exchange of bullets and the cop was on the ground.  And I was left, standing, with briefcase in hand, staring at this killer in the streets.  The shooter definitely saw me frozen on the sidewalk as we made eye contact.  Then he smiled rather strangely, this smug, confident look on his face.

The sirens hadn’t stopped, it seemed like more cars were on their way, 2, no 3 cruisers came flying down the road.  And now down the side of the street where Mr. Green was facing, that’s what we’ll refer to him now as on account of his hair and height, there was a SWAT van that just pulled up.  The time that it took me to look that way and back to Mr. Green, he had somehow pulled a rocket launcher out from the back of the vehicle.  Let me tell you it made the most spectacular light show as it blew that van to smithereens, those SWAT guys never stood a chance.  The police officers on the other side of the street, now out of their cars, came down the side of the road.  Bullets were flying between both sides but Mr. Green was quite the marksman.  He polished off the men on foot, then laughed a maniacal laugh.  But that was a mistake.  He had forgotten an officer creeping up behind him who without hesitation shot him dead.

I couldn’t believe what I had just witnessed.  This ridiculous rampage just unfolded before my eyes.  More policemen arrived just as Mr. Green fell, almost as if in slow motion.  What had this man done?  What was his past?  Why?  I was curious about what could drive a man to this behavior.  But I was doomed to never know the answers to those questions now.

I was shaken up, but didn’t know if I should continue to head over to the café.  I decided not to, I had lost my appetite, so instead, I just walked back to the office.  This city sure has gotten insane the last couple days, I was always curious of the stories told back at the office, but now had my own story.  That was when the strangest thing happened.  Passing the hospital, I swear to God I saw Mr. Green.  It was the same, green haired tall gun-wielding man from before, just without the guns.  He was standing three feet in front of me, which caused me to stop dead in my tracks.

“Wait!”

He looked me in the eyes and smiled smugly again

“You just died!”

“Did I?”

“What the hell is going on?”

“You work at Pacific Standard?  You don’t work at the tower in the main offices, do you?”

I assume Mr. Green noticed my employee badge still pinned on my shirt.

“And you’re bored as hell right?  Got a cousin that works construction in East Vinewood yeah?”

I was surprised by all this information.

“How do I know you?  How do you know my cousin?”

“Don’t worry about it, he told me about you.  Plus I heard about you from some friends.  We’ll talk later.”

“What do you mean talk later?”

Then Mr. Green might have said the most ridiculous thing I’ve heard in a long time, something that made absolutely no sense.

“I just gotta reload my save, then finish some side missions.  I’ll talk to you later.”

“What do you mea…

It was so boring, that there really wasn’t much to remember.  As far as I could recall, this office building, my small apartment, and the city between it was my life.  

My phone started buzzing on my office desk as soon as I had decided to go get something to eat for lunch.  It was my cousin Vinny who just sent me a text, “*Hey cousin, how you doing?  Still working at the bank?  There’s this guy….well, anyways, I got a job you should here about*”

""Tim, this is a professional environment; we don't appreciate swearing.""

Captain Kopra floated over to the radio panel. Timothy Peake handed him the headphones. The crew haven't heard anything in months. The transmission sounded
&gt;To the crew of the ISS: humanity has failed. Tensions between countries have led to war. We were not able to suppress it and rescue you.

""What should we do? Certainly the vast majority of the population will have died.""

""I do not know. There is nothing left for us on Earth. We could try to contact our Martian colony, but they won't last without support from Earth. No one will help us when we land. Maybe the Russians received a transmission with more definitive instructions."" replied the captain.

I would say that it was green and blue, but that's no longer the case. The landscape took on a more gray and brown color scheme. We watched in horror as the world lit itself up.

The German had tears clouding his eyes, but nothing came out. The Japanese man couldn't force himself to watch anymore, he had left the windows and was mumbling to himself. The Russian was openly weeping and I could see him reaching for the bottle to numb himself. Also on the station was my friend from Ohio, fruitlessly using the radio to contact mission control.

""Houstin? Do you copy? Over.""

Myself? I prayed. One might ask, ""why are you praying? You just witnessed humanity drive itself to extinction!"" You see, that's exactly why I was praying. I prayed that there was a god out there watching over us when we die. Without ground control, we're bound to die too.

"[WP]""Better to rein in hell then surf in heaven.""",anyotherorganians,"You'd think that something so inefficient, infuriating, and unpleasant as office politics and middle management would be firmly in the wheelhouse of Down Below.

But no, after a few decades in Heaven you get pretty familiar with the complete and utter incapacity of angels to do anything creative.

They weren't given free will after all, they were just made to be obedient and full of praise. The ultimate yes-men, yes-women, and yes-faces-of-a-lion-eagle-bull-and-man-things.

God had kind of pitched a fit since his go to guy, Lucifer, had tried to take things over a few millenia back, and had locked himself in his office making beetles ever since.

And Jesus? The heir apparent to the whole shebang did his best to try and fix Daddy's company, but a few centuries of having a bunch of halo-sporting butt-kissers tut-tutting and saying ""That's not the way our Father did things..."" you'd spend most of your time turning water into wine and appearing on tortillas in Tijuana too.

""Care to explain that again, Mikh'sholel?"" I said, pinching the bridge of my nose.

""I don't see what's so difficult. Here in Heaven we are to take care of all God's creatures, great and small. Surfing didn't exist for the vast majority of history.

No one was using the surf park, and we needed SOMEWHERE to put the piranhas, leeches, sea snakes, and candiru.""

I glared at the Angel of the Lord and thought ungodly thoughts, ""Well, mankind is here now, and I was hoping to get my surf on without being having all my blood sucked out, my flesh devoured, and a friggin' fish embedded in my dick.""

Mick, as we'd taking to calling him... her... it looked at me funny. ""You're immortal, your form is merely a mental projection and restores itself to take on your ideal image of yourself quite rapidly.""

""It still hurts, though!"" I said, moving behind the uncomprehending angel and began to pluck out feathers.

""Ow. Ow. Please stop that. Ow."" it said with all the pain and passion of Ben Stein reading the telephone directory.

After the original members of mankind started dying and showing up in Heaven the Big G-man attempted to coax his two creations into getting along better by mixing traits. Mortal men were now immortal and pretty much indestructible. Angels had feelings grafted on in an attempt to get them to empathize.

But they weren't really wired quite right to feel much of anything. So like Mick they didn't really react to pain and treated it as just another sensation.

I was pretty sure the angel was only complaining because she felt like it was the proper, human thing to do.

""Well, Mickey...""

""Mikh'sholel."" the angel corrected snippily.

""Since I can't get my surf on I'm going to head downstairs and drop in on your big brother. I'm sure Lucy's got a nice wavy body of water to torment the aquaphobes with.""

The angel wrinkled its nose and snorted disgustedly. ""Do what you will. But I really wish you people wouldn't encourage my brother and his rebellious friends. He's supposed to be in time out, thinking about the things he's done wrong.""

I picked up my board, gave Mickey the finger, and headed for the nearest stairs.

Despite what you may think, Heaven and Hell aren't actually very far apart. It makes for a more effective punishment that way. You can see what you missed out on while suffering for eternity.

And the colossal hooting dickholes in Heaven can organize a picnic on a cloud overlooking the ever-burning lake of fire so they can watch the damn scream and sizzle, allowing them to point, laugh, and stick their tongues out and go neener-neener-neener, I got into Heaven and you didn't.

And not only are those people complete and utter slimy sacks of smegma in the shape of a man, but the food sucks too.

I mean who the fuck thinks butter-drenched vegetables are good picnic food? Limp stalks of greasy asparagus. Yuck.

Satan's actually a pretty decent guy. He's SUPPOSED to be sitting in hell contemplating his failed attempt to overthrow God, but instead he's basically gone ""Fine, I'll build my own heaven! With blackjack! And hookers!""

And so it was. The angels tended towards ""Eww, sex! Ewwie, ewwie, eww! Put that person who does lots of the sex where I don't have to look at them and think about genitals and bodily fluids!""

So the devil did in fact have all the hookers.

Not to say Hell can't be unpleasant. But the moment you realize that you're just as immortal as the next guy, and that the only reason he's bigger and stronger than you is because you imagine yourself as smaller and weaker, well you don't tend to stay tormented for much longer.

Of course humans being humans some people can be really fucking dim. Some just sit sizzling in the lake of fire not realizing that they can fucking swim to shore and climb out using the handholds that thousands of damned souls have worn into the rock over the ages.

I found the Prince of Darkness in a lush, albeit red, jungle. It was always best to ask politely if you wanted to use something in Hell. If you don't want the fundamentalists wandering in and looking all offended at your game of Dungeons and Dragons you pretty much had to play in the basement.

And one session where you suddenly have a bunch of naked polygamists chained together in an amusing fashion swept through the room on a tide of liquid shit is enough for most people to make sure that the place hasn't already been booked.

So here I was, in the midst of Hell, surfboard in hand, to ask the Lord of Lies if I could use his pool.

He was feeding dog biscuits to a rather happy Gallomimus, a sort of rather ostrich-like dinosaur.

""Huh. I thought dinosaurs were supposed to have feathers."" I said, looking over the scaly beast, who was on its back, wriggling happily and having its tummy rubbed.

Lucifer rolled his eyes, ""It's frustrating trying to deal with humans sometimes. There are significant factions that think dinosaurs never existed and that to lead people away from God that I planted their bones in the ground.""

""Others think that mankind and dinosaurs existed at the same time, thus the origin of dragons.""

""But it's those ridiculous angels that are actually sticking false fossils in the ground, making dinosaurs seem feathery instead of scaly.""

Apparently I'd stumbled over a sore point.

""And why'd they do that?""

Lucifer grinned, ""Because it's only just in the last few centuries that my siblings realized just how cool dinosaurs are and are trying to hop onto the bandwagon. Anything scaly belongs to me, due to the whole serpent incident.""

The Lord of Hell gave the creature one last pat on the belly and rose, looking me over. The Prince of Darkness chuckled.

""Candiru in the surf park, eh?""

The dinosaur had enough of not being paid attention to and had gotten to its feet as well, and was nudging its snout against the Prince of Darkness' hand.

""Yup.""

""I told them they should just make a new area. We have infinite space, after all, but my siblings aren't known for being creative and started whining about how creation was something that Dad was supposed to do, and there had to be a design committee, and blah blah blah and so on and so forth.

'Oh but we've never used it, Lucifer!' Stupid gits, just because that's the way that things have always been doesn't mean that that's the way things will always be.""

The Devil dusted off his hands, ""We've got a naval re-enactment going on in the big one, and I've got the medium one reserved for a frat house that stood around and watched a drunk girl drown in the pool. They've got about two hours until the gas leak catches fire. Two of them are down for maintenance and cleaning, and the other one doesn't really do waves.

Sorry to say it looks like you won't be able to get any surfing in until next week. Unless you know, you want a fish embedded in your urethra.""

""No thanks.""

Lucifer shooed the overly affection dinosaur, ""Hey, you know what you could do instead?""

""What?""

""You ever ridden a T-rex before?"" the Devil said with a him-ish grin.

I shook my head and smiled, ""Well, better to rein in Hell than surf in Heaven, I suppose.""

Lucifer groaned, ""Ugh. Where did I leave my red hot pokers?""",VonKrieger

The only property you were allowed to step your foot on was the massive garden behind the house, lawn in front of it and that little shed located near the hedge. When you first came here, you did not question that rule. Everyone has personal space, and you were surely not the one to disturb it. You were well paid, loved your job and the owners always treated you well which only led you to mind your own buissness. However, this spring you finally noticed things. The owners and their relatives occasionally leaving the house pale. Guests entering, but never leaving. And when you asked them, if they felt the almost-earthquake rumbling below the fountain area, they looked at you in an almost piercing gaze, telling you to again, mind your own buissness. 

Today, however, you want to check it out. There is definetly something fishy happening there, and the feeling in your gut demands you to enter that house. You wait until everyone left for work, and armed with your trusty hoe you climb onto the balcony from the shed. You push the glass door, leading into the house, and..

Jackpot. It's unlocked. You are now in someone's bedroom, the owner's child's you assume, since there was an xbox controller placed on the bedstand. As you open the squeaky door leading to the corridor, your reasoning voice tells you to turn back before it is too late. You swiftly kill it and proceed along the corridor and down the stairs. You pass the kitchen, the dining room, the living room, the bathroom and several other on your search for the stairs to the basement. After you throughly check behind every door, not finding the stairs leading down you become puzzled. There surely has to be a way down. Your inner Nicolas Cage wont let you give up this ""treasure search"". You come back to the family's library, and start looking through the book names. ""Harry potter and the goblet of fire, Saeculum, Kamasutra"" you mumble, until you come across a book with a silver, leather covered book without a name. Interested, you decide to look at it closer. As you take it, out of sheer luck (and plot convenience) a secret passage behind the bookshelf opens. Stairs.

You take a step. The stairs let out an ear-ripping screech. You continue further. The air reeks of moss and composing rats. Step by step, you approach a room where the light cannot reach.

Machines. Blood. Chains.

Looks like a scene straight out of saw.

Around you are several cages with bodies. Some of them are breathing. Some of them aren't.

The people inside them are ordered by age. To your left you see old people, or so you think judging by their naked, wrinkly skin.

To your right, young adults.. and children.

The youngest one, about 7, girl, is missing her leg and chin. The blood around her is clearly fresh, indicating that this was done to her recently. 

Next to her, a boy, about 14, dead. He has a little leg, probably the girl's, sticking out of his gut, his throat slit.

Witnessing this horrendous sight you immediatly, violently throw up. You have never been this disgusted your whole life.

What sickos would do this? You HAVE to get out of here. Tell about this to someone. Anyone.

But behind you, you hear soft steps, a gentle laugh and a chain dragging across the floor.




You're next.

Section 4. I'll be your instructor this semester.

The topic of this class is the emerging explosion based civilization from sector 39.c. Or as the inhabitants call their home, Earth, Milky Way.

This is a complex though deeply digressive civilization. The Earthlings represent an example of a developmental digressive civilization from the Dr. Forj mainline system developmental pathway. This divergence began when the French civilization lost their epic struggle against the Anglophonics.

Obviously we won't be recreating their explosion based technology in lab, but we will observe endemic simulators, available from their subreddit r/michaelbaygifs

We implemented the reddit system in an attempt to rectify their divergence from the Forj mainline system. But of course in a classic illustration of the self reinforcing nature of explosion based technologies, the Earthlings chose to use Snoo's Reddit to simply create more explosion based subreddits. Rather than tantric sexual consciousness based technology, which would return their civilization to the Forj mainline technological development of tantric consciousness space travel.

Many of you already familiar with Earth based Reddit technology may point out that they have created r/circlejerk

This is true, and it is a welcoming sign for their space fairing potential. But they have far too few 911s in that subreddit to lead to interstellar travel.

[WP] Write about how World War 3 occurred because of an innocuous comment,ThisCatIsTangerine,"Sit down son and let me tell you how WW3 got started

""The war you fought in?""

""Yes, now wouldya sit down boy""

Okay. So it all started out in September of 2015.. a man by the name of Donald Trump ran for president.. he came to power because he said what other people were too afraid to say. He told people what they wanted to hear and was quite entertaining at it too. He'd have you cracking up on his comments about 

""Lion Ted""

and

""Crooked Hillary"" 

heck he'd always tell his opponents,

""You have low energy, you're sweating.. look at this, RUBIO is sweating.. can't take the heat?""

What did it for me was he took out this water bottle and started to shake the water out of it like so and kept saying ""RUBIOOOO"".. you know mocking the fact he (Rubio) started to sweat.

On November 8, 2016. Donald Trump was elected President of the United States. He won the last few states by a landslide. When he gave his victory speech as we called it back then, he was very presidential. Polite even. He was still Trump but not.. the Trump we knew and loved. He was different.

WW3 started because of ONE line Trump said about a month later. He thought since he could get away with saying ""Mexico will build a wall and they're paying for it"" he could get away with anything. A Russian jet (MiG-31) came into collision with a U.S. plane.. the Russian plane was buzzing the U.S.'s planes (buzzing means flying REALLY close but not actually hitting the plane, it's like taunting or just showing off) and actually hit. The two of them burst into flames and that was that.

Right after this happened Trump held an emergency press conference.. he said Putin was gonna come to the U.S. and meet face to face with him to explain why he thinks he can boss people around.. Trump said he'd knock the smile of Putin's face.

We never heard back from Putin or Russia.. we just seen

""Well I don't know what happened but *It* definitely happened in your zone, so get to it and fix it or I assure you the entire blame will fall on you,"" said Astaroth, Duke of Hell, and that was it. You couldn't think to argue with a Duke, especially when you were only an intern. 

You left the ofice, taking a last dejected look at the plastic plants that tried to make it homely. You knew your job was on the line, but seriously, this was your first day on the god -sorry- helldamned work. 

""Nothing to it, really. Either I solve this and float or its back to the Pool of Eternal Punishment for the Procastinators,"" you thought. 

Outside the office, that had central heating, waited a frozen wasteland, with demons and lost soulds looking extremely confused. Hell wasn't designed to freeze, the torture chambers used lava for half the tortures. And it was just bad for the trademark. This was important. 

So you took the elevator to Earth and flew as fast as you could to your zoning. Each minute was a minute that Astaroth was thinking of a new punishment if you failed, you knew, so you had to hurry.

The source of meta-magical energy was coming from a nearby pasta restaurant. Confused, you turned invisible and went inside, avoiding the influx of customers.

“They have to be the source,” you thought, looking at the young couple sitting in a table at the corner. She was smiling shyly at him, while he tried to split a slice of pizza for her and tangled his hands with the hot cheese. 

“But why?” they didn’t look like the usual warlocks, or the pious monks that normally were the cause of such problems.  They were just a normal, awkward couple in their first date. 

It made no sense, and you had no experience in the field (and you spent the time you were alive redditing), and the minutes were trickling and you could feel Astaroth getting angrier and angrier. 

“What is going on?” To a demon, time and Space were things that you read in the C3b report at the office. So you went into the future and saw that they were getting married and living happily, yet a bit bored, for a long time. But nothing to do with the goddam  -jeez, sorry- satandamned freezing spell that had taken hell by their collective horns. 

Out of ideas, you went into the past. Not surprisingly, they hadn’t met before: He saw their first day at their jobs, their first day of college, their first significant others… Nothing about… Oh.

Thirty years ago, and you saw it as if you were there. Because you were. Remember, that about time and space?

“No way! Forget about it!” Yelled the girl, shaking her head so hard her ponitails shaked all around her head. “I’ll never date such a prick like you! You are mean and smelly and a *boy*”

“You don’t have to put it like that, I bet you could date me, my aunt says I’m going to be a very handsome man,” answered the boy, his face red with shame.

“I said no way!” Said the girl. And then: “Hell would have to freeze over first, you nitwick!”

You went back to hell in a hurry, and talked to Paradoxical Department, because it was not your problem after all, but theirs. They had to learn to read the paperwork that came from Earth with more attention. 

And a couple aeons later, you had a promotion. It was a happy ending, except for all the torture of lost souls.

The first of few during his stay in the molten underworld known to the Higher Powers as Hell.


*Three minutes left.*


It was a nice spot after all, no guards were around, his daily ration wasn't over cooked. In fact, he could taste the seasoning in his sandwich.  A might too hot for him as the curry spices brought the cilantro out, but it was an oddity.  


If there was a natural source of life, he might even have compared it to a summer's day.  A nice spot for lunch, a cool breeze in the distance, a warmth to his bottom.   He had to consider that before he looked at his watch again.


*one minute thirty.*


Alas, it was too bad that this kind of weather wouldn't last, after all it was He-


Phillip looked up from his sandwich.  There were daemons above, yelling and shouting at anything that moved. They all appeared to be busy trying to claw at any being that came close enough.


His watched finally beeped.  It was time to get back to work.


As an old industrial building inspector, he was afraid that it might take him some time to find the root of the issue.  Sighing deeply, it was his job to maintain the heat, the boiler rooms as well as the ninth circle of hell, Swedish adopted yodeling.


He shuddered.  It was only two days ago he had to determine why the circle was burning unevenly.  


Making it back to his station, the minor spirits were in a haze, trying to rub themselves on the pipes, starting to build their own fires from magic to no avail.  Sighing once more, he would have to requisition a temporary grill for the sweetpeas of this section.  The paperwork itself would take an *eternity*.


Looking down at his check sheet, he skipped the level one disturbances.  ""Leafs winning the Stanley Cup, Cubs winning the Series... etc etc."" 


There was Leicester City winning the Premier League, but that wasn't the major issue, only having a 32% chance of cooling the pipes a mere degree Celcius.  


Then he saw it. His hands started to shake as he reached for the emergency communication link to the Big Boss.


""Emergency Line, how can I inconvenience you.""


""Drumpf, code 12.""


The comm's went dead, then a hoarse voice erupted from Phillip's end.  Anger ejaculated from the small electronic box, the Big Boss's spirit crawling towards him.


""Drumpf, code 12 Boss.""



There was silence. The breeze was cool in Hell.

"[WP] You're a demon, and Hell is freezing over",helpimstuckinabook,"Hell isn't what you think it is.

I imagine you sitting there imagining an endless red wasteland, accompanied by vicious torrents of lava streaking through the air and a crimson sun bearing down on us all. Well, you'd be right about that bit. But the people here mostly aren't too bad. And note my use of the word 'people'.

That's right, not everyone is unlucky enough to be a demon like me.

The majority of hells occupants are still human, or have some human left in them. They're here for petty crimes, thefts, lies, which have built up over a lifetime and ended in their final judgement not going the way they'd hoped. I feel sorry for them. The heat burns them and the fire beats away at their skin, but they won't mutate.

No, mutations only happen to those who have no soul. Like me. First my eyes bulged out of my head, then my skin started to darken until it reached a deep, blood red. My hands turned to claws, my fingers to nails, and my teeth to fangs. But it doesn't happen overnight, that's the worst part. It takes an eternity and the longer you're here the worse it gets. You should see some of the guys on the lower tiers. They even frighten me. And I'm a fucking demon.

Worryingly, they've been frightening me even more recently with talks of stopping the Freeze. Oh, I didn't mention the Freeze. It started in the far East and has been spreading, slowly. At first there was widespread panic, until a giant of a demon named Samaruk who's been here God knows how long (he probably does, you'd have to ask him) came up with a plan. Immediately demons and humans of all sizes fell into place behind him. I didn't take them seriously until I snuck into a tier-black meeting fifty years ago. Using Ancient Magicks Samaruk has summoned a pit of cursed lava which has been steadily growing for many a year. This fire possesses magical qualities and when harnessed correctly is more than capable of stopping the Freeze. If this happens, Samuruk will rise to power in a blaze of infernal glory. He may even become strong enough to pose a threat to the Humans.

I don't want this to happen. I sinned on Earth. My crime was so terrible I dare not even speak of it again, and believe me when I tell you I've suffered dearly. But no amount of physical pain could take away the images permanently etched into my memory. No amount of heat can melt my scars. 

The people up *there*, the good people, they are the ones who deserve to live their lives. They may only live to be 80, or 50, or 10, but that is their right in accordance with Him. And I respect this. I respect that there may be people capable of leading lives happier than mine, and without committing sins so evil that they will be condemned to eternal damnation.

That is why I will give my life, or what's left of it, to foil the black tier's plot. I've already been tortured, beaten and burnt for over a thousand years. They've taken everything from me, and I will take everything from them. 

This is my final word - my plan is to break into Samaruk's chambers while the beast sleeps, and kill him the only way you can kill a demon of his size - rip out his heart and eat it. 

If I succeed, you will hear from me again. If not, know that Samaruk will have me tortured in the most inhumane ways imaginable until the end of time. Remember me, but do not forgive me. 

I lost that privilege a life time ago.  ",imFakeSnake

Black blood flowed between my fingers as I placed pressure on the wound to my gut. Each breath I took left a cloud of condensation that soon disappeared into the still air of the cavern.

Behind me, Red struggled to her feet as the blades of bone, the yellow-white spines, rescinded back into my flesh.

""What have you done?"" she said, glancing past me to reach, to cradle the lifeless body at my feet. ""Luke? Luke!"" she shouted.

I groaned as my wounds closed violently. My knees trembled and I found myself kneeling beside Red as she violently shook the fallen angel. White feathers, stained with blood flitted about the chilled air.

""I'm sorry,"" I whispered to her, still reeling from the pain.

She lay the corpse gently onto the cavern floor and closed his eyes, before turning to face me with a furious gaze.

""You... you traitor!"" she screamed. Her hands were clenched, steam rose from her body as her eyes turned a brilliant hue of orange. I stumbled backwards as she rose to her feet, head hung low and body trembling. A guttural snarl that echoed through the cold.

""Run."" A dark streak and sudden rush of wind. She disappeared from view, tackled far from reach.

""Blue!"" I shouted as a flame and siren's scream erupted in the distance.

""Dammit, run!"" he answered back as bolts of fires shot across the cave.

I leapt to my feet. Two paces and I had slipped on the spreading ice. The cavern become colder with every passing moment. With gritted teeth, I forced the bones out through my feet and stumbled forward beneath their grip.

Away from the fire and the screams.

I blocked out the rage of my friend, and desperation of my ally. Towards the clanking of steel on rock. The bitter sound of chains and torment.

A stream of fire shot past before me. I covered my face as it passed, but still I saw it. Clad in blackness, thrashing against its bonds, silent save the gusts from its black wings, the fluttering of its black robes.

Then a gruesome scream from afar and all was dark. And all was quiet. That terrible creature before me vanished in the shadows. I marched on towards Death, following the sounds of it's plight.

My wounds had not healed, no the ichor instead froze in the paralyzing cold as I shambled forward. I struggled with each unfeeling step, each numb stride, until I could feel the air sweeping towards me.

I reeled forward. The numbness replaced with a seething pain, and the cold air with the scent of burnt flesh. Crashing into the wall of the cavern, beside the angel of death.

Ossified stakes, blades of bone emerged from my forearms as a tongue of flame in demon's shape strode towards me. My back contorted as still more spines emerged, slick with ichor that froze in the cold. Sharper still from the obsidian blood.

""It's futile!"" I bellowed towards the effigy of fire. She stopped and raised an arm.

""Is it worth dying for Black?"" the brilliant mistress asked.

Saint Peter called my name and I stepped forward as he read off many of my good deeds.

""Sorry?"" I asked, nervously. ""Yes, you have a done plenty of great deeds, but you never accepted god in your heart."" At that moment I understood what he meant. I was an atheist, I had no idea what afterlife was gonna hold for me so I didn't want to try and waste my time on some god. But it turns out there is, and now he isn't letting me in. ""What's going to happen to me? hell?"" he responded ""of course not, hell was always for the true sinners of the world. You will spend the rest of your time in purgatory with the others who were deemed unworthy"" I felt relived that I wouldn't spend the rest of my afterlife in eternal punishment. That relief would soon turn to apathy as I realized just how boring purgatory truly is. It's nothing, a single seemingly endless white room with many other deceased like me. How long has it been? Years? Decades? Centuries? I stopped keeping count eventually, the nothingness has practically eaten away at my soul. Even throughout all the boredom at least I didn't feel lonely because I met a friend there, Barry. Barry was always nice, relaxed, and friendly. When I first showed up he was there, asked me how, and just talked about how life was before the incident. He doesn't show up too often though. He'd disappear and I'd never know where he'd go off to. Sometimes he'd be back before I knew it, other times he'd be gone longer. After one especially long time gone Barry showed up again and I was just talking about how awful this place was like most conversations. ""I just can't stand it anymore, all this boredom is starting to feel worse than hell"" I said to Barry. ""Is that truly how you feel?"" He said. ""Of course, I just want the boredom to stop"" I responded. ""Very well"" Barry said before opening up a portal before my very eyes, I felt like I made a huge mistake. ""What is this thing?"" I said to Barry ""It's a portal to hell"" he said right before pushing me through and jumping in. I was terrified, I'm not a thief, or a murder, or a rapist. I'm harmless, how am I gonna survive in this world? I thought. But I took a moment and looked around me and it didn't look like a place for the worst sinners on earth. It looked like a normal city, and everyone who walked by me weren't dangerous. They just looked like normal people. ""Are you sure this place is hell?"" I asked Barry. ""Yeah man, hell isn't a place for sinners to burn for all eternity. It's a second chance. A second chance for them to live normal lives, without all the demons that haunted them before their death"" I was shocked. I feel I can actually make a living here, make friends, have fun.

“Bet you didn’t think I’d be this big,” laughed the copy. It was taller. Broader of shoulder. With a big, big smile. And it had torn at Brianna every day for as long as she could remember.

She charged, broom spinning. The blow landed on the copy’s shoulder with a splitting crack and pushed down and away.

[WP] A new invention allows you to duel your inner demons.,IStruggleWithThings,"It was my mind, and I was in control. I stood on a circular domed arena, massive pillars as support. Everybody manifested their battle differently, imagination being the only limit. I preferred things orderly, without distraction. I stood in black armor that seemed to put off a faint blue light. The shoulders and gauntlets were spiked, fitting together like they were made for my body. 

""I'm ready"" I said in a serious tone. 

The creature began to manifest. This was something you couldn't control, even though you were in your own mind. The machine manifested your emotions how it saw them, so you never knew what to expect. A massive red creature appeared, orange cracks down its side. It was larger than I expected, perhaps 100 feet tall. It had six razor-tipped legs, and wicked looking scythes and the end of it's four arms, serrated at the tip. It's long tail whipped back and forth, crashing against the side of the wall leaving large crater. Its mouth was too long, sharp teeth in rows, almost to its neck. 

Today I fought Hatred. 

I manifested a massive bow in my hand, Firing three quick shots as the beast finished appearing. The arrows stuck its body, light spraying out like blood that looked like light where the arrows hit. The beast screamed, then charged. I dropped the bow, manifesting I massive sword in my hand. Twice as long as a man, and half as wide, it would be impossible to lift in real life. This was my mind though, and I was in control. I leaped twenty feet into the air, slicing downward with all my strength. The beast caught my sword in his scythe like arms, crossed to block the blow.

It struck with the other two, knocking me back, scoring deep gashes into my armor. I dropped the sword as I fell back, throwing knives as fast as I could make them as I did a back flip, then cracking the rocks as I landed on one knee, kneeling. The beast ran faster than It should have been able to for its size and swung from all angles with its four serrated arms. I nimbly sidestepped the blows, grabbing one of the arms. And pulled with all my might. The arm ripped free, blood light erupting from the beasts stump. It screamed in pain, turning to the side to sweep me with its massive tail. 

I summoned the sword again, and met the tail head on. Jolts shot up my arm as The tail was split in two, covering my armor with light blood as I sliced a part of the tail completely off. The beast whipped to the side again with a scream, knocking me to my back. Before I could react, piercing legs were rapidly slamming into my armor. One got through, puncturing my side. I screamed out in pain. 

""Don't you dare end it yet!"" I screamed at the air. I saw an opening, and rolled to the side, manifesting a spear as I did. I rammed it upward into the belly of the beast, light blood pouring onto the ground. I summoned spear after spear, jamming them into the torso of the beast. It let out a wail, then stumbled. I barely got out from below it before it fell to the ground. I summoned a katana, walking around to the front of the creature. It looked at me with pure hated, light blood pouring from its body. It struck down with the two scythe arms that were free, but I easily ducked them, slicing both arms off at the base. 

""The day is mine demon."" I said as I straddled its head, pulling. It let out a piercing wail, but I only pulled harder. The top of the head came free with a sickening crack, and the beast stopped moving. I raised the head, holding it up for a crown I could not see.

I came aware sitting in a chair, wincing from the pain in my side. A doctor was already treating the puncture wound. When you fought in the mind, the body agreed. You could die in there. They removed the thoughtmitter from my head. ""Great show,"" my producer Dave, a thin man in a tailored suit and thick glasses said. ""We'll make a lot off of this fight on pay-per-view. And nice ending, our viewers will love it."" He said. I winced, but nodded. There were worse ways to make money, and we all had to die sometime. It might as well be with a clear conscious.

Face to face, mono-a-mono, there it was.  It was me, through and through.  Average height, dark eyes and dark hair that was somewhere in between curly and straight.  I stood there somewhere in between fear and awe.  I quickly desired to get back to the outside world, but the thought was interrupted, I felt the inner surroundings shake. It was everywhere, myself.  I calmed myself down and the light became less fluorescent with each breath.  

I could say no words and in thought I sarcastically cursed my friend who sold me this new shit.  ""Ok, ok... You're fine,"" I convinced myself.  Sounds of applause came from all around.

This would be tooo easy. The kids were running around in the dark, probably in their underwear if my older sister had been anything to judge by, then I see a light go out. ""Well what have we here?"" I question to myself as a second one goes out, I don't have time to worry about it, I pull the mask down my face the smile carved into it as wide and creepy as ever. As I walked up the bank from the lake I hold my perfectly sharpened knife in a reverse grip before spinning it holding it by the blade. 
         I walk out of the darkness of the trees before hefting up my machete and grab the teen by her hair and sending her to hell with a downward slash to her neck, it might be hard to see through this damn mask but it adds to the effect. The cabin door is open, why are teens so damn stupid these days, I walk through to find one of them, the lonely one jacking off in the corner. I leave him, I'm not one to hit a man while he's down, I continue walking towards the lights that run through the darkness before I see one of them suddenly vanish and hear the muffled screams of a teen girl being stabbed in the back. Who's here with me?
      The knife slides easily though her spinal cord but when I finally pull it free I fear detection by a teen but when I look up I see a 6ft man with a hockey mask on holding a machete, looking at me questioningly. I glare at him through my mask and then suddenly he laughs, which sends me into one of my giggling fits and walks over and hugs me. ""You are like a son I never had"" he tells me and I feel accepted ""you seem to make me feel like I have a father for once"" he looks at me with acceptance and we walk along to kill the rest of the stupid high schoolers whose hormones led them to their deaths.

[CW] Write a horror story. Scare the reader without scaring or harming the characters.,CyberPunkButNotAPunk,"The house was haunted, they’d been told. 

Oliver had turned to Pamela then, and shrugged. “It will be cheaper, you know. These things drive down the price so.”

“Always the economist, I see,” Pamela had replied, laughing. Oliver hadn’t seen what was so funny, but he’d taken that for agreement and paid the down payment.

They moved in a month later, filling the rooms with Pamela’s paintings and child-sized furniture for Adam. And they were happier than they’d ever been. The first night in the house – their very own house, finally – was spent sitting across from each other at their new oak table, with glasses of champagne and medium-rare steak, smiling at each other across the flickering candlelight. Though truth be told, the candles had only been used because they’d moved in a day earlier than their electricity account was supposed to start.

Still, if that first night was a portent of things to come, then it was a fairly accurate one. The house was huge and old and perfect – everything that they’d ever dreamed of. There was a large enough kitchen for Oliver to perform his many cooking experiments in, there was a large veranda outside where Pamela liked to sit with her easel and paintbrush, there were many nooks and crannies for a child of five to play hide-and-seek in. They hosted dinner parties, and had family movie nights (boring Barney nights, really), and – even though they now had fully functioning electrical lighting – had even more candlelit dinners after Adam was tucked in and fast asleep. In the back of their minds, though, they’d always wondered if the house was really haunted, if they would one day be driven out screaming from their beds.

It was almost four months before Oliver met the ghost.

It began with the usual, stereotypical things. Too many loud creaks on the staircase at night, finding the lights turned on when Pamela swore she had turned them off, getting woken to Adam crying non-stop at half-past three in the morning. It all went on for three whole weeks. Oliver had steadfastly refused to believe that this was the work of a ghost, but on Pamela’s insistence, one night he pulled up a chair in Adam’s room and sat there with a baseball bat in hand, daring any ghost to show its face.

And show its face it did, just when Oliver was about to doze off. He heard a voice whisper his name, dragging out the syllables. Blinking, he squinted into the shadows, and almost made out something – someone. A figure, tall and stooped, translucent and pearly-white but wearing a cloak of shadows, such that Oliver would have assumed it was a mere trick of the eye, had the figure not spoken then.

“Greetings, Oliver.” A soft, not-quite-menacing but none-too-friendly voice, with a charming lilt. He strained his ears to listen more closely. “I trust you are enjoying my house.”

“The house is mine, thank you very much.” Oliver said loudly, getting up and readying himself to take a swing if necessary. Behind him, Adam stirred.

“Oh yes, oh yes.” The ghost laughed. “I wish you happiness, all the happiness in the world, my friend.”

And with that, the ghost was gone, swallowed up by the shadows. Oliver sighed and sat back down, rubbing his eyes.

He spent the rest of the night sitting in the chair, but the ghost did not return. Nor did the ghost return the next night, or the following, or any other night at all. But the creaking had stopped too, and the lights stopped turning on by themselves, and Adam slept soundly through the night again. Those three weeks had been awful. But now, they could finally properly enjoy life in the house, without living in a state of anticipation and dread. It made Oliver feel free and relieved, when he realised that the ghost wasn’t coming back. He and Pamela enjoyed many more nights of steak and wine and cheese. He enjoyed sitting on the veranda with her in silence, watching her make the canvas come to life with artful splashes of colour. He even enjoyed those Barney movie nights, singing along to the ridiculous – though admittedly educational – songs with Adam.

He could not remember a time in his life when he’d been happier.

Even his friends commented on the change in him. He’d been too serious, too sedate, too obsessed with his work. But now, he was more jovial, more cheery, laughing at even the tiniest joke with the most infectious joy. Everyone loved being with him. The monthly dinner parties swelled with guests, and they all had a good time, talking and laughing and drinking.

But then, the friends slowly stopped coming. Oliver was puzzled, but Pamela had a sharp answer ready for him. “You laughed for five whole minutes when Eunice tripped over Adam’s lego.”

“Oh come on now, Pamela. You’ve got to admit it was pretty damn funny.”

“No, Oliver, that was absolutely cruel of you! The poor girl was so embarrassed. And not to mention that time you laughed at Amy for getting retrenched. God. Or when Leonard’s kid dropped out of school and you made a joke about him and McDonald’s or something. I don’t know what’s happened to you, it’s like I don’t even know you anymore!”

Oliver couldn’t help it. Pamela’s crossed look – her furrowed eyebrows and flashing eyes and pouted lips – was just too funny. He laughed. And when Pamela slapped him, he laughed even harder.

Still, even without the dinner parties, life was good and Oliver was happy. He had the perfect house, a great job, a great wife, a great house, a lovely son, and the most wonderful house. There was so much beauty and happiness to be found in the world – in the most fragile flower, in the swiftly coursing river, in the bright sun hanging high in the clear blue sky, in the fresh air that fills our lungs. 

And also in the way Pamela so hastily packed her suitcase. In the way Adam screamed and cried and had to be prised away from his father there was a certain happiness. 

Oliver smiled, and laughed when all this happened, for he was just so very happy. Indeed, nowadays he laughed often, and he laughed much. 

And deep in the night, when all else was still and the long blades of grass gave not even the slightest rustle, from far away the neighbours could hear the big empty house filled with reverberating echoes of his laughter.

He considered the question. There were plenty of awful fates, getting skinned alive, having your organs removed, getting buried underground.

""Is this within the realm of feasible possibility? Are we allowed to make people immor....um sorry, I just lost my train of thought there. I'm feeling kind of distracted right now.""

He felt like there was something he was forgetting. Something important.

""That's perfectly alright. In answer to your question you can make them immortal but it wouldn't matter, the answer's the same regardless.""

He considered that.

""I'm gonna say death then.""

""Interesting. Why?""

""Well when you're dead, there's no consciousness. Whatever life you lived, however you died, it doesn't matter. It's a concept that's impossible for living minds to fathom, so we don't think about it.""

""You're on the right track. However it could be argued that life has some inherent value, even if it doesn't if it's gone. As it happens I know a worse fate. Let me ask you something. Do you know where you are right now?""

""What do you mean.""

""As in, where we are standing, having this conversation.""

He didn't understand.

""I don't...know.""

""Exactly""

Then it dawned on him. The thing that had been bothering him. And then he knew the answer.

""We aren't real.""

""Indeed. The writer didn't give us a location; he thought it would be a better reveal that way.""

Jack might have been scared, but he wasn't, because some part of him had known all along what this had been about. Because that was how he'd been designed.

Those assembled in the room nodded. None remiss upon reviewing the grizzly murder each of them had committed. Each one unique, a pillow, poison, knife. One of them a blond haired youth asphixiated him in a bowl of whipped cream.

Detective Hamm snapped his fingers. ""I've solved the mystery!"" He pointed at Anthony. ""It was you!""

Everyone in the room gasped. ""Prove it."" Anthony said, crossing his arms. 

""Trivial. Your DNA was found at the scene of the crime. More specifically, your hair.""

""So what, old man?"" Anthony said, ""Maybe Bart and I had a secret tryst last night. Doesn't prove I murdered him.""

""True, but the hair was found exclusively on the desk and in the area surrounding it."" Hamm pointed to Bartholomew's body. ""There was only one thing that occurred there last night: murder!""

""And what of the fact that the murder weapon was found in your room?"" Daniel asked.

""Are you actually trying to accuse the detective of the crime?"" Hamm chuckled. ""If I were the murderer, why would I have taken the weapon with me? Do you believe me to be incompetent at my job?

Carol nodded. ""Don't worry, Detective. I believe in your innocence. I'm still at a loss, though: why would Anthony kill Bartholomew?""

""Ah, yes. I think I can conclude the motive,"" Hamm said, ""While we were chatting in the garden, Anthony imparted upon me the following words: 'Bartholomew's such an ass. I love him more than anything in the world, and he refuses to reciprocate.' A classic case of unrequited love, methinks.""

Anthony choked back a sob. ""Well, guess you cracked it, chum. I just wanted to make him love me. Is that so much to ask? I guess I loved him too much. I was going to off him, and then myself, but when my turn came, I just couldn't do it. I'm just a coward.""

As Hamm summoned the deputy to handcuff Anthony and take him away, Carol stood up and patted Hamm on the shoulder. ""Excellent work, Detective. Another case closed. Shall we all get drinks now?""

**Dimension A2:**

Detective Hamm clapped his hands together. ""I've figured it out!"" He pointed at Carol. ""It was you!""

Everyone in the room gasped. ""Prove it."" Carol said, crossing her legs. 

""Easily. A mystery set of fingerprints were found on the gun, no doubt belonging to the culprit. You are the owner of these fingerprints, Miss Carol.""

""Preposterous!"" Carol said, ""They're a mystery for a reason. You have my prints; you know they don't match.""

""Yes, you did technically pass the fingerprint test. But you cheated."" Hamm moved forward and gripped her right arm. ""Unhand me at once!"" Carol shrieked. Hamm consented, and Anthony and Daniel gasped. Carol's hand had fallen completely off, its wrist tapering off in a metal rod. In one swift motion, Hamm rolled up the sleeve of her coat, revealing Carol's true hand.

""Well, Carol. Care to confess now, or shall we go ahead and redo the test?"" Carol crossed her arms and sulked.

""And what of Anthony's hair being found at the scene of the crime?"" Daniel asked.

""Sure, it proves Anthony was there. But all the hair was found by the bed, nowhere near the desk area. I assume he was snooping for some paraphernalia?""

Anthony blushed. ""Well, I guess I'll come clean, old boy: yes, I was trying to steal his pillowcase. Better than being accused of murder, I suppose. But Caroline, why'd you do it?""

""Ah, yes. I think I can deduce the motive,"" Hamm said, ""While we were chatting in the garden, Carol imparted upon me the following words: 'Bartholomew's such a pig. He thinks he can get away with making those inappropriate remarks? I'll show him.' Perhaps she let her temper get the better of her.""

Carol dropped her face into her hands. ""That's right, Hamm. I wanted to give him a taste of his own medicine, make him feel the fear I always felt when he made those creepy jokes and uncouth comments. But even at gunpoint, he was still insulting me, and I just lost control.""

As Hamm summoned the deputy to handcuff Carol and take her away, Daniel stood up and patted Hamm on the shoulder. ""Good work, Detective. Another case closed. Now, I've got a hankering for some booze. Shall we?""

**Dimension A3:**

Detective Hamm tossed his glasses to the table. ""I've deduced the culprit!"" He pointed at Daniel. ""It was you!""

Everyone in the room gasped. ""Prove it."" Daniel said, crossing his eyes. 

""Elementary. It's below freezing outside, and our heating's been disabled. Yet here you are, shivering in your skivvies. What happened to your jacket?""

""I spilled beer on it,"" Daniel said, ""so lay off my clothing choices."" 

""Is that what you spilled? Or was it blood?"" Hamm withdrew a sheaf of paper from his briefcase. ""I had forensics run a test on the laundry. Surprise, surprise. Traces of Bartholomew's blood were found on your jacket. This means only one thing: his blood is on your hands!""

""And what of Carol's fingerprints on the gun?"" Anthony inquired.

""Carol's fingerprints were found on the barrel of the gun, not the trigger. Yes, they could've been wiped, but why would she not wipe the entire gun? My hypothesis is that she snuck into Bartholomew's room with the intention to steal the gun, only to then notice our beloved host's dead body. In a panic, she fled, not daring to come back and wipe her prints lest she be caught in the act of doing so.""

Carol sighed. ""You're right as always, Detective. I was just going to use the gun to intimidate Bartholomew; I would never dream of killing him. Even now, I can't imagine why Daniel would kill Bart.""

""Ah, yes. I think I can deduce the motive,"" Hamm said, ""While we were chatting in the garden, Daniel imparted upon me the following words: 'Bartholomew's such a miser. I'm in a tight spot now, and he won't even spare me a penny.' Vengeance, perhaps? Or a bit of extortion that quickly devolved into violence?""

Daniel threw his hands up. ""You got me, Hamm. I got ahold of his gun, threatened to kill him if he didn't loan me a couple thousand. But he refused, that stubborn son of a bitch. In the heat of the moment, I pulled the trigger. Go ahead; lock me up.""

As Hamm summoned the deputy to handcuff Daniel and take him away, Anthony stood up and patted Hamm on the shoulder. ""Good job, old boy. Another case closed. Now, come on. Drinks are on me tonight!""

**Dimension A4:**

Detective Hamm stamped his foot. ""I've cracked the case!"" He pointed at the body of Bartholomew. ""It was a suicide!""

Everyone in the room gasped. ""How can you tell?"" Anthony asked, crossing the room for another drink. 

""Simple. We know Bartholomew was shot in the forehead at point-blank range. The bullet exited the back of his head, tore a small hole in the chair he was sitting in, and embedded itself in the opposite wall."" Hamm traced the bullet's trajectory with his finger. ""For a gunman to have shot Bartholomew, he would've had to be crouching on top of the desk and leaning forward. If that were the case, there would've been scuff marks on the desk, and Bartholomew could've easily disarmed him.""

""And what of the blood on Daniel's jacket?"" Carol pointed out.

""Bart's blood was found on Daniel's person; that's true. But it was found on the hem of his jacket. It was clearly not from a splatter or a spill. My hypothesis is that Daniel stole into Bartholomew's room, perhaps with the intention to steal something, but stumbled across our beloved host's dead body. In a panic, he fled and remained silent over his discovery out of fear that it would incriminate him."" 

Daniel nodded morosely. ""It's the truth, I'm afraid. I just needed a treasure of his to pawn. I'm glad we sorted this out, but I still can't imagine why Barty would kill himself.""

""Ah, yes. I think I can deduce the motive,"" Hamm said, ""While we were chatting in the garden, Bartholomew imparted upon me the following words: 'I hate my life. I have no friends outside of those three, and they keep trying to jack my shit.'""

Anthony, Carol, and Daniel exchanged sheepish looks with each other. ""Well, that's awkward."" Anthony said.

""Yeah,"" Hamm agreed, ""Well, another case closed. Let's all get trashed.""

---

**Dimension A5:**

Detective Hamm slammed his drink onto the table. ""I've identified the perpetrator!"" He pointed at the three people sitting across from him. ""It was all three of you!""

Everyone in the room gasped. ""Whoa, hey, calm down buddy!"" Anthony said crossly.

""Don't tell me what to do! Anthony, your hair was found at the scene of the crime. Carol, your fingerprints were found on the gun. Daniel, Bartholomew's blood was found on your jacket. The evidence is irrefutable!""

""And what of the murder weapon you-okay, fine. Stop. Yeah, okay."" Carol raised her hands in defeat. 

Daniel inched backwards in his chair. ""Well, I'm glad we sorted this out. Can't imagine why any of us would conspire to kill Bartholomew, though. Care to enlighten us, Detective?""

""Ah, yes. I think I can deduce the motive,"" Hamm said, ""While we were chatting in the garden, Bartholomew imparted upon me the following words: 'Hamm, why are you still talking to me? Get lost.'""

""Well, that sounds as good a reason as any to off him,"" Anthony muttered.

""Indeed,"" Hamm said, slowly backing out of the room with the gun still trained on the three others. ""Well, time to get wasted."" And he ran out of the mansion.",hideouts

The house was built a long time ago. The forest wasn't quite as thick then--a great many trees were cleared out, but many have been planted by people since. The house was built with bricks and wood. Bricks on either side of the wood. It makes the house very strong.

The house was built by a wealthy man, who had gained much wealth in the service of his King. The house was lived in for many, many years. The first man's son raised his family in his house, but things were changing. The son had sons of his own, and three of them did not like the King. There was a war, and two went to fight. One came home missing his arm. One didn't come home at all. The house was different then. Things were sadder, for a while. 

Years went by. The house was in a part of the land that was not really in the North, but not really in the South. Many people with dark skin come to the house and stay a night and then set off. The house is now lived in by the grandson of the third son of the second man. He is kind to the people with dark skin, and gives them food.

A terrible storm came one day, and for three days and three nights snow fell. The wind blew and blew and the snow drifts reached up to the top of the windows on the ground floor of the house. It was scary, and the house's roof was nearly ruined, and it cost a lot of money to get it repaired.

Nobody has lived there in quite some time. The last of the family moved away years ago. There was a war in Europe and the grandsons of the man who helped the people with dark skin went to help. They came back, but they decided not to stay. 

The house still stands.",CryptidGrimnoir
[CW] Write a story with no characters where the setting itself is the story.,CyberPunkButNotAPunk,"It was just past one on an unseasonably warm Nebraska afternoon as the bus, packed with cheerleaders, directors, and pep band members (and our instruments), drove by the arena. From the outside, the massive building appeared to belong in outer space, or the future.  The sun glimmered off the reflective surface, blindingly white.  Near the top of the building hung a huge red “N,” proudly claiming the arena for the University of Nebraska Huskers.  In front of the stadium flew an army of flags, lining the walkway towards the great glass doors.  Though it was still over an hour to game time, thousands of fans were already congregating, lining up to enter the grand arena through those doors.  This bus would not be among them.  Instead, it continued its loop, around to the back of the arena.  Here, the shining façade gave way, revealing the building’s less glamorous foundation.

The walls were made of solid, grey concrete, not gleaming glass and metal, as they appeared to be from the front.  Behemoth trucks carrying television production equipment beep-beep-beeped as they backed into massive rectangular holes, cut irreverently into the side of the building.  The back entrance's cracked and weather-worn parking lot was guarded by a gate in a simple chain link fence. Leading up to the door was a makeshift set of metal stairs, rusting at the edges.  The wind began to pick up as the bus was unloaded, adding a chill to the air.  Instruments, drums, flags, and bags were hauled up the stairs towards a steely grey door that creaked loudly on its hinges, resisting any attempts to pull it open.

Inside was the arena’s cavernous basement, segmented by curtains, one of which was designated “Band Holding Area” by scrawled handwriting on a white piece of paper.  Instruments were dumped in a corner, waiting to be used. The basement was like the underbelly of the great beast that was the arena. Pipes run up the walls and along the ceiling, branching off at specific intervals to bring water to various places around the building.  On the far wall, air ducts rattled, working to deliver temperature-controlled air into the rest of the building.  Huge bundles of wire, in an odd rainbow of black, red, yellow, and blue, snaked along the walls, providing the monstrous amounts of electricity needed to put on the show.
Pillars of reinforced concrete supported the many floors of seating and concourses above.  Down here, the atmosphere was one of calm efficiency, tinged slightly with the anticipation of a big game.

A dimly lit tunnel sloped gradually upwards towards the court.  The tunnel opened into the massive arena, with three levels of seats circling the court, and reaching up so high that the highest rows were almost out of sight.  The lower two levels of the arena were nearly filled with fans who sported Nebraska red and white, despite the fact that their team was no longer in the tournament.  The combined sound of their idle chatter reached a dull roar, but the noise was nothing compared to deafening cheers in the heat of a game.  In the center of the arena, hanging from the high ceiling, was a gigantic jumbotron in the shape of a cube, with large screens on each side.  The audio from the videos on the screen echoed around the arena, booming from massive speakers high in the rafters.  Amid the steady lights that lit the court were bright spotlights that swiveled around the arena, illuminating different sections in turn.  As the team ran out onto the court, lights glimmered and the fight song blared.

Up here, all that simmering anticipation was brought to a boil. Announcers' voices boomed, lights flashed, fans cheered, bands trumpeted and players played. This was the big show, the main event, the grand stage. And yet, a quote on the wall served to put the day's pomp and circumstance in perspective. It read: “Not the victory but the action; not the goal but the game; in the deed the glory,"" a reminder that, while everyone cheers for the big game in the breathtaking stadium, the real show had been going on for a long time, behind the scenes.

[CW] Write a story with no characters where the setting itself is the story.,CyberPunkButNotAPunk,"Soft and snug, I have surreptitiously witnessed my family's coming of age better than any human I know. Disguised by thread and fabric, I possess ears and eyes that have obscurely observed the dynamic events of their life just as any human being would see them. I have been the foundation of equilibrium during family events, such as birthday parties, holidays, or even weddings and funerals, where relatives could communally sit and interact. Whether it was for annual birthdays, Thanksgivings and Christmas, or to watch the tragic end of the Washington Redskins’ last playoff game in such a magical season in 2013, the very elements that make my owner's human have secretly seeped into me. I have consumed countless tears and have hosted contagious laughter. The very experiences that make up my owner's past, memories, and identity, have unknowingly soaked into my stuffing.
Previously mistaken for an inanimate object, I have actually been the heart of my family's childhood, an evident foundation of their human make-up, the wallflower at every family event. Without me, where would great-grandma Teresa rest her bones during Christmas? Where would Ashley shed my tears of anguish? Would Melanie still have received her first kiss without the cliché setting of my loveseat? Hardly remembered for being significant in many peoples’ lives, I have been more than just a comfortable place to rest. I have been a place that my owners have inadvertently visited when they could face no other human. The magnet of communication between relatives, the attracting force at every social event, the almighty listening friend in times of need, I am the living room couch.

There is no wind in this area on a day like today. Just the overwhelming heat, and a encroaching, palpable sense of it for all those who may have entered it before this time. The sun leaves massive streaks of vivid color on the numerous behemoth masses of sandstone, their presence like that of the guardians of some unknown treasure none of us will ever see. Except for maybe the flies that is.

The stench of decay is unbearable. The lack of wind only increasing the flavor of rot in the air. The sun having baked all color from it at this point, it was a color of no discernable origin. Coarse, scalding, dryness had caused the inevitable drawing back of feature, making it bizarrely shriveled and withered.

[WP] People cannot walk through mirrors because their reflection keeps them from going through. You are a vampire.,EmpressOfTheSpacebar,"Have you ever looked through a mirror? Of course you have, every one, we'll almost every one has. You see what everyone expects to see. Yourself, on occasion others behind you and your surroundings.

Here what you don't see. Me. Call me Kevin. I'm a vampire. I like to hang out on the other side of the mirror. When you brush your teeth at night I might be there picking a bit of artery out of my teeth. Or more likely picking my nose.

Truth be told it doesn't matter what I'm doing. If I'm there you going to die in a little anyway. Now given some horrible paradox I live between worlds when I stand in front of a mirror. Now don't think too hard about that I still haven't gotten to the point.

Here we go. Okay are you ready? The times when you or anyone else isn't looking/observing through a mirror in some way things can go a little wonky. I know I know, wonky is a little vuage. Well that's the best way to explain it. Sometimes the grass can be blue, I mean BLUE like electric blue! Once somehow I saw what seemed to be a monstrously large cross between a chihuahua and a bumblebee. To this day I dream of that moment. Slowly hovering a scant couple feet off the ground with its large bulbous vacant mammalian eyes. Sickly spindly legs vainly scrambling for the ground it never guite reached. The body covered it bristle yellow and black hair. The with gs beating even to fast for me to follow. Oddly the only menacing part of the beast was the stinger. Of all the miss happen parts this being posseed only the staggeringly lethal tail end was perfectly formed. Have you ever seen a bees stinger? It's not smooth. It's designed to get stuck in you when inserted into its target.

But by far the worst was when I had to hide out in some morrons bathroom mirror. I ducked in for a early dinner when company dropped in. Perhaps eight or so ""freinds"". So anyway I'm stuck in the bathroom trying not to gag when some douch didn't flush when the TV comes on. From my vantage point I could just see the TV. They were all ringed around it staring like you people do when I notice what they were watching. 

Now let me first say this, not all ""wonky"" moments are the same. Most of the time you can say ""OH WOW LOOK AT THAT!"". I have long ago however noticed that a significant amount of the time things stay the same. Here's the thing though eventually I began to notice the little differences. You get stuck in one mirror for too long and you notice when a vase is red crystal when once it was jade.

So I'm watching the TV when out of the kitchen come the sound of a top to beer being popped. Then the light dims and then into my line of sight comes, I shit you not the one thing scarier the Chibumble, my mom. Now I understand. So what? It's my mom big deal.

Well my mom has been dead for nigh a hundred and fifty years. I did the deed myself. That was the deal with my maker. He turns me and he promises my first kill could be her.

So when I saw her demure lips sipping a Bud, if I could I would have shit a brick. To make matters worse. Her gaze began to slowly, but steadily turn towards me. I will never know if she knew I was there. For the Instant she could perceive my hiding place she vanished as all things did. Somehow though I know she could feel me there lurking. I have never seen her since. Tell you this though I don't hide in mirror much any more.",Thage22

Stockholm, Sweden

The streets were filled with rubble and debris. What once was a colorful and lively town laid soundless and monochrome. Samuel stood infront of a line of people, flanked by half a dozen men with assault rifles. There were two men, five women and nineteen kids kneeling on the cold concrete with their hands bound behind their backs. 

They were all vermin in the eyes of the Fourth Reich. Insects who would dare offend the superiority of the English language. 

Samuel cleared his throat. ""All of you have been accused of the most heinous crime against the Reich. That of debasing the natural superiority of our great language. The lazy and decadent leaders of the past might've allowed such an offense to go unpunished,"" Samuel stood with his hands behind his back and his head held high. ""But, we of the Reich are not so lenient."" 

Samuel gestured to two of his men, ""Bring the offending piece of writing, if you will.""

The two soldiers grabbed both ends of a wooden sign about one and a half foot long. They showed it to the accused. A girl no older than eleven began sobbing. On the wooden sign was written the word, 'libbary' in crayon.

Samuel kneeled down to eye level with the girl. ""*No!* Don't you dare touch her!"", a women screeched before she was hit in the face with a rifle butt. She laid on the ground, helpless as the soldiers kicked her.

""Hello, sweetie,"" Samuel said amiably, ""Why don't you tell me a bit about this sign here?""

The girl spoke in between sniffles and sobs. ""I... I thought that was how you were supposed to spell it! People told me that it was wrong, but I thought it was okay!""

A gloved hand smacked the girl across the face, knocking her down. ""You thought that spelling library as 'libbary' was 'okay'? Ha! Is this what's become of the younger generation? Can you communicate in nothing but emojis now?!"", Samuel pulled his pistol out of it's holster and aimed it at the sobbing girl. 

""W-wait! I was the one who approved the sign!"", said a pudgy, balding man with a pencil mustache, ""If anything the blame falls upon-""

He was interrupted by a sound that made his ears ring. The gunshot echoed off the walls of the empty and ruined buildings. Blood sputtered out of a hole in the girl's head. 

""You said that you approved of this girl's actions?"", Samuel said as he raised his pistol once more.

The old man's eyes went wide, ""No! Wait!""

Samuel pulled the trigger. Another gunshot. Another corpse.

""Your a monster,"" an elderly, wrinkled old woman spat.

""In that circumstance, how do you spell 'You're'? As a contraction?"", replied Samuel.

""How the fuck should I know?"", retorted the woman.

Samuel sneered and leveraged his gun. He aimed and squeezed the trigger. It jammed. The woman laughed. The laugh was a nervous shakey thing. Samuel gently put the gun back into it's holster.

Instead he went for the knife stuffed in his boot.

The woman stopped laughing. She screamed. He grabbed her hair and stabbed her in the stomach. Once. Twice. Thrice. She fell to the ground much like the others. Blood covered the officer's coat and boots, he didn't seem very disturbed by it.

""It seems like we're done here,"" Samuel announced.

""What do we do with the rest?"", asked a soldier.

""Kill half of them, let the others live,"" Samuel lit a cigarette. ""We need to teach them a lesson.""

""A lesson on proper grammer.""

"[WP] The entire Star Wars series, all 7 movies, are released as one book, written by Dr. Seuss.",Holy_Shit_A_Username,"In that distant galaxy, in that time of old

Events most mysterious have begun to unfold

War has begun, Palpatine's been kidnapped

That Grevious, the Sepratist, has got him trapped

With four light sabre blades and four robotic arms

He is quite a strong monster, even out in the stars

The Jedi gave chase, leaving no stone unturned

Their Senator Palpatine must be returned

They slaughter Count Dooku, and get him unchained

But Grevious appears, and he will not be tamed

He captures them both and though they do escape

He still nearly kills them, smirking with his cape

When Annie arrives, Padme tells him good news

She is pregnant! And Annie blushed down to his shoes

Though she worries a bit, he is most overjoyed

But soon he gets visions of death to avoid

Just like his mother, not so long ago

Padme's doomed to die, let it not be so!

Obi-wan is suspicions, he thinks Palpatine corrupt

And stations young Annie to keep watch and disrupt

Together, the two quite swiftly become friends

But is Palpatine honest, or is his truth filled with bends?

He leads on poor Annie with honey'd words on his breath 

And claims knowledge of tricks that can even thwart death

While Obi-Wan is on Utapau, dueling Grievous to the end

The Senator says that he is not a friend

In truth he is the evil that pulls all the strings:

""I am Darth Sidious! The dark lord of all things!""

Annakin soon runs, to alert the Jedi

But Mace Windu appears, as he was passing by

He goes to strike down the imposter at once

But Annakin stops him! That kid's such a dunce!

He thinks that the Sith may hold secrets within

That could save his fair Padme! And the senator grinned

He struck down Windu, as he knew that he must

And took Annakin on as his pupil, in trust

""Go kill all the Jedi, and the Sepratists too

If you so help me, so I will help you too.""

Annakin, in his grief, had a mind filled with mud

And though many are children, soon the temple rained blood

Then Sidious turned, and gave orders from high

To all of the clone troopers, for the time was nigh!

Turn on the Jedi! And many are slain

Though Yoda and Obi-Wan escape yet again

The Senator claimed that the Jedi had sought

To take over them all! And his words power bought

With the entire galaxy under his command

The Jedi are doomed! It is just as he planned!

Padme is quite shocked, she knows not what to do

But she flies to her love (and Obi-Wan does come too)

She wants Annie to flee, so they can live instead

But Annie has let power go to his head

He attacks her himself, thinking him she betrayed

When Obi-wan steps from her ship where he laid. 

The Jedi now fight - former friends, nevermore

Meanwhile Yoda and Sidious duke it out on the floor

Yoda looks like he's winning, victory's in his grasp

But the dark lord's too strong, and he must flee at last

Yoda is dismayed - at his best, he has lost

And so goes into exile, to atone for the cost

On the planet, the duel is not going so well

Annie has lost two arms, and a leg, and he failed

Obi-Wan spares him, and he left him and bailed

Annie's life was not over, despite pain and grief

Sidious saved him, and gave him relief

With cyber enhancements, he will walk again

But his old life is over, now Darth Vader's begins

Padme is well, but has lost all will to live

Though her children are born, she has nothing to give

And so, with her heart shattered and cut to the bone

She died on the table, feeling utterly alone

Sidious lies and tells Vader a sin

That in anger, it was Vader who did Padme in

As hate courses through him, his fate is now sealed

Vader is Sidious' toy, he may never be healed

Though the Jedi were strong as the force they were with

Today evil has won, it's The Revenge of the Sith

"[WP] You are abducted by aliens. While aboard their ship, you are chosen to give the alien elders a 5 minute pitch as to why the human race deserves to survive.",Illuminated_Squirtle,"It seemed like the kind of situation that would induce panic - the fate of my entire species resting on my shoulders - but instead, surprisingly, I found myself immediately feeling calm and prepared to speak.  Perhaps it was a background in public speaking that made me feel as if this was just another short lecture to an unusual audience.

*""Two things make humans great: diversity and community,""* I began.  *""Diversity means variety, and humans possess it in every conceivable sense of the word.  Around their planet humans have developed a stunning variety of different types of society.  They think differently.  They act differently, with some being kind and some being cruel.  They solve problems differently.  Every person in the world would answer your question differently - from the most powerful and convincing argument that humans must survive, to an apathetic shrug.""*

*""But humans also form a community.  One thing all human societies share is that they are group-oriented, from the smallest single-family groups to the nations that wage wars or travel to space - humans work together.  And most humans care about each other, at least on some level.""*

I thought about my own family and suddenly my confidence wavered.  The thought of their imminent deaths if I were to fail overwhelmed me and I began to splutter.

*""You can uh, see for yourself if you huhm""* I was stammering at this point, *""Travel to earth or...connect to its internet and look at uhnm...communities there, they can prove for you how wortwhile people are...I like communities like the writing prompt community of Reddit, uhm and...""*

An unexplainable force, one that made me feel as if I were being crushed, caused me to fall silent and I knew my time was up.

They communicated telepathically to me that they were not convinced that humanity was worth saving, but also not convinced that it deserved extermination.  They needed more time.

I found myself deposited on Earth again, and I burst in to tears.  I wasn't sure if their answer was something to comfort or frighten me.  

In the two months since that initial encounter I have often wondered what those powerful beings were thinking about.  Were they watching the human race?  Did they really take to heart what I had said?  Were they thinking about human diversity, human community, even the online communities I visit?

To my shock, today I saw a post on Reddit that nearly made me stop breathing. *""[WP] You are abducted by aliens.  While aboard their ship, you are chosen to give the alien elders a 5 minute pitch as to why the human race deserves to survive.""*  This was exactly what happened to me two months ago!

Panic swept over me - what did this mean?  Did the person who posted the writing prompt know what had happened?  I hadn't told a single other human being...

...then I saw the user name and another wave of panic struck me.  It was the same phrase the beings had used to describe their own race: Illuminated Squirtle.  It was a new account - created after I had told the the creatures to try the internet as a tool for investigating humans more.  This was a test, but nobody in this small online community would know exactly how much there would be to lose if they failed.

Following my advice, they are looking for answers, but have at least realized that it takes more than one person to prove that humans are diverse, creative, and a community.  It's up to us now.",THETEH

I don’t know why I thought it’d be good idea to keep driving all night, instead of just stopping at that motel 20 miles back. I thought it wasn’t worth it. Save that forty bucks for gas and a meal. Besides, when you’ve been driving for twelve hours straight, chewing on coffee grinds from the pit of a mug, decisions slur. Time moves fast then slow. Fast, then slower. Everything feels heavy. Hands, shoulder, breath. I’d just closed my eyes for a moment. It was just a blink, but when I opened them again. BOOM. No longer on the road. The ditch caught my car like a well laid trap.

The road was wooded and still and dark. No streetlight or moonlight of any kind. Just headlights illuminating the gray mist creeping in front of me. And phonelight, teasing me with the very bright “3:22 AM” and “NO SIGNAL”. Nationwide 4G my ass. Not another car in sight—not even the sound of movement, except from the trees whose branches crackle in the wind. I had to get help. Or maybe help would come? I sat there for a moment, contemplating other great decisions in my life, wondering if this would be another one. I got out of the car, using phonelight to guide me.

I don’t know how long I’ve been trudging down this road, but my light catches something that’s not a tree. A Honda, new and shiny, probably a rental, on the side of the road. Not in a ditch, just abandoned. I go over to investigate. Maybe someone was just out of gas or had a flat and needed help. I look inside. Empty. No… not empty. There’s a flicker of something between the seats. I try the door. It opens. I reach inside. It’s down pretty far. I have to balance myself with the steering wheel. I touch something wet, but I don’t care. My fingers finally reach the object and I manage to pull it out. A phone. Unknown caller. I answer.

“Charles! Charles!” A woman shouts in a loud whisper.

“Huh?” It’s all I could make out. I fall onto the car seat. Soft. I could sleep. 

“That man that you’re with, he’s not who he says he is!” She continues in a whisper. “You need to get away from him now!”

I sit up, wiping the sweat off my brow. I forget my hand was wet from something. I look down. It’s red. It’s blood. There’s blood on the steering wheel. I’m awake again.

“Holy shit!”

“You—you’re not Charles! Who… who are you?”

“I—I—my car fell into a ditch and I came here looking for help…”

“Is Charles there? Put Charles on. I want to know he’s okay.”

“He’s… not here…” I say looking around.  “There’s no one else here.” I try wiping the blood off on the door, but there’s more blood there too. I’m just smearing it everywhere like a kid with fingerpaint.

“Where is he? What do you want?” She sounds frantic, like she’s crying.

“Look, I don’t know what’s going on, but you need to call the police!”

“Why? What’s happening? Who *are you?*”

“Just call them, okay?” I look out the windows. Whoever did this to Charles could be coming back any moment. It’s pitch black though. Can’t see anything.

“Yes, of course…” she says, almost resigned. “Can you check something for me?”

“What?” I ask, hunched over. I don’t want anyone to see me. The phone’s jarring bright light is a dead giveaway.

“Look under the seat, there should be a small canister there.”

With my bloodied hand, I feel around under the seat until I catch something. I pull out something small, rectangular, covered in an aluminum shield.

“Got it.” I’m whispering now.

“The combination is: blue, blue, purple, yellow, purple.”

I turn the canister over and, sure enough, there are eight colors there. It’s tough to see. I hold it really close and without thinking, I put in the combination. The canister pops open and sprays something right into my face. I start coughing uncontrollably. It’s the worst smelling thing I’ve ever suffered. Like rotten eggs in dog diarrhea.

“Listen asshole,” she says. “You’ve just contracted the virus you were after.”

“Wha—*cough*!”

“If you want the antiviral before you start vomiting blood, you better put Charles on the line, right now.”

“I don’t know any Charles!” I yell. “I told you! My car went into a ditch and—”

“Symptoms begin showing in an hour. Get me Charles or your body liquefies.”
She hangs up.

I hurl the canister onto the floor.

“FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!”

I don’t even care who hears me. At this point, I want someone to hear me. I need someone to hear me. Was she serious? A virus? That had to be bullshit right?

My stomach churned.

My face grew hot.

Sweat seeped through my clothes.

My breath quickened.

I got out, hoping Charles was just hiding somewhere nearby, when I spotted more blood… leading into the woods. Was Charles there? Who was with him? Whose blood was this? I didn’t have time to stand around and think. It’d been around three minutes since I’d opened the canister. That left me 57 minutes to get Charles. 57 minutes to get the cure. I don’t know what’s out there, but I need a weapon. I find a tire iron in the trunk. It’ll have to do.

As I stand outside, holding the tire iron up to the phone light with my crimson stained hand and my stomach boiling, I can’t help but laugh. This is what I get for being such a cheap ass bastard.",CoffeeAndShave

As you pick it up, it lights up, and someone calls you.",PalePrincessSnowWite,"I pulled over and approached the scene. The car seemed undamaged, there was even a bit of gas in the tank. Still, there was no sign of the driver, and the wheel and seat were covered in a thick layer of dust. Only one thing stood out: a beat-up old cellphone right by the open door. As soon as I picked it up, the screen lit up. The caller was registered as ""The Watcher"". After some hesitation, I took a deep breath and accepted the call.

""You've been chosen,"" a deep voice sounded from the speaker.

""Who is this?"" I answered. ""I just found this...""

I was cut off.

""Get in the car,"" the voice continued. ""You don't have much time.""

""You don't even know who...""

That's when I noticed them: small shadows approaching from the side of the road. It didn't seem like they walked, just moved, getting closer and closer. With my knees shaking, I watched as more and more began rising in the back. The voice from the phone snapped me out of my stupor:

""They are already there, aren't they? You have to hurry. Get to the car!""

Tripping over my own two feet, I ran back to my car. I tugged at the door as hard as I could, but it wouldn't budge.

""Why did I close the fucking door?"" I screamed out loud.

""You didn't,"" the voice from the phone answered. ""It won't open. You're in their world now. You know what to do.""

I slowly turned my head and looked at the abandoned car. The shadows were getting closer. With no other alternative, I rushed to the car. The keys were already in the ignition.

""Follow my directions. Don't worry there's enough gas to get to the nearest city."" The voice on the phone was surprisingly calm. ""And whatever you do, do not hang up!""

He paused.

""Remember everything. Writing down won't do. Believe me, you'll need it.""

Even with the lights on, the road was pitch black. If it weren't for my strange guide, I wouldn't have even seen the turns. At least the shadows were gone. After about half an hour of driving I noticed that the indicator was showing an empty tank, the cellphone's battery was also seemingly at 0 as well. Despite that, both worked flawlessly. I tried asking questions, but ""The Watcher"" ignored me, only speaking up to signal about an upcoming turn. Finally he guided me to some sort of small city. As soon as I stopped, the lights in the car went out.

""Now listen carefully."" The Watcher was breathing heavily; seemed like even he was getting stressed. ""Leave the phone in the car. Walk to the intersection of Cherry Lane and River Road. It should be not far from here. Whenever you have to take a turn, try not to look back. There's gonna be an old apartment complex at the intersection. Walk in and ask to see The Watcher. They'll guide you to the basement. Walk slowly, if you hear any noise besides your own footsteps stop and close your eyes until it passes. Don't mess up!""

I sighed and asked, my voice shaking:

""What happens if I do?""

""I don't know, but it won't be pretty.""

""Anything else you want to tell me?"" I asked, hoping for at least some sort of clarity.

""I'm sorry.""

The screen went black. Hoping that all of this turns out to be a dream I followed the voice's commands. Cherry Lane and River Road were not far. The old run-down apartment complex stood out in an otherwise neat and tidy neighbourhood. Gathering the remains of my courage I stepped inside. The young woman at the reception smiled at me.

""You are here to see the Watcher?"" she asked, her bright red lips in a slight smile.

""Yes.""

""Right this way, sir,"" the woman said, walking down to the basement with a set of keys in her hand.

I don't know how long we descended. After one of the corners the woman was gone and I was left alone, slowly descending the impossibly long stairs. Somewhat surprisingly, there were no sounds. Finally I reached a white door. As soon as I touched it, the piece of wood collapsed inward. What I saw inside made my skin crawl.

A huge mass of flesh filled the room. It grew on the walls, it lined the floor, it dripped like goo down from the ceiling. Grotesque eyes, disfigured limbs, internal organs still living in this disgusting mass of gore. Among all of this, in the centre of the room was a cocoon, a veil of muscle fixating an old emaciated man with a phone in his hand.

""I'm sorry,"" he said once more, his voice hoarse.

As I turned to run, the flesh began latching onto me. The deformed limbs dragged me back towards the cocoon. Screaming and clawing I was slowly driven closer to the trapped man. His body slid out of the living trap, as I was dragged inside. He stood up, trembling from the exertion on his atrophied body. As I was consumed by the mass of muscle, he leaned in, put the phone in my hand, and whispered:

""When it becomes too much, you know what to do. I lasted five years. I'm sorry I couldn't hold out for more and sorry it had to be you. Goodbye.""

Having said that he left. Tears forming in my eyes, I looked down at the phone. There was only one number to call: ""The Chosen.""",Pyronar

This is my first post to any sub-Reddit, but it as well the first time I have shared any of my work and I would appreciate any honest criticism.  


Tanner was a nostalgic man. He has always believed in the importance of the remembrance of the past in order to guide the choices of the future. And to the side of the beaten path was a relic of his youth. An old Mustang was parked on the side that leaned into a ditch that threatened to pull it in. It was not his of course, and he could tell not only from the location, but also from the lack of cliché flames that would leave an enthusiast in tears. Tanner parked his Malibu in front of the Mustang while being mindful of the ditch. With a smile, he soon found himself lost in the memories the old beauty offered when his eyes noticed a light from a silent phone on the passenger seat. He looked around to the surrounding fields in vain as he could not see more than a few yards away, in search of the owner of the Mustang. No one to be found. The phone stopped. The light from the seat began again, though this time a soft voice echoed from inside the vehicle through the crack of the window, “Tanner is that you?” Silence and sudden tears were beckoned forward from old emotions. He stood in confusion as the familiar emotions flooded him as the soothing voice continued, “It’s been a while, hasn’t it?” the woman’s lovely voice sounded like the beauty of night in phonetic form. Soon Tanner was in the car before his mind returned to the world with the phone to his ear with the speaker off. “You don’t have to talk,” she continued, “I understand that this is confusing and I may never be able to explain it to you until we meet again.” 

Tanner now unable to hold back the tears, “Jamie is that you…Where are you?”  A giggle was her response, “Like I said, I can’t explain it.” The silence that followed only revealed the sounds that came from the winds and the confused man’s emotions. “I remember the nights like these,” Jamie continued, “It is hard to imagine that anything could be more beautiful. It actually reminds me of our favorite night.” 

Tanner laughed, “That was our night. Do you still have the dress?” She must have had a smile when she spoke, “You loved that old thing. Yes, I still have it and I always will, even when we meet again.”

“When will that be?” Tanner questioned like a child.

“Don’t know. Though, be happy for me. A light soul more easily ascends.”

“Heaven? Are you in Heaven?”

“I am somewhere,” she said, but Tanner heard her uncertainty, “But we will meet” she continued. 

“Is death the only way?” Tanner questioned. 

“There is no maps to where I am, there are no directions. Just keep a light soul and we will meet again.” She murmured.  “Be good and be happy. And know that I will always love you. Good-bye Tanner.”

The winds and the confused man’s emotions were now alone. He dropped the phone back onto the passenger seat as he launched himself out of the piece of shit in rage. Soon he was back in his car with the gun and duffle bag in the passenger seat. Little time had passed before Tanner was back on the road as he headed back to where he came.

*The air is cold, filled with a musky salt. A boat, stapled with a blanket of rotting wooden boards and dirty old ragged flags sails slowly across the ocean. Birds hum the air, sailors sing, and the horizon stretches further and further towards oblivion. A man, with a big wool-like beard, fitted with a black overcoat, and a pointed hat with one cross and two cross bones painted onto it, stands on deck. He has a crooked back, a creaking wooden leg, and a rusty old hook. His eye, of which one is fitted with a worn out eye patch, is red like the pits of Hell, fierce and unforgiving.*

The waves crash against ancient wood, the boards that were once part of the ship that kept it sea worthy are flung off and are left alone like herd of panicked cattle scattering, to perish into the deep unknown sea below, empty, waiting to be filled with carcasses of ships and their guardians, who once steered them into battles, perhaps through their own intentions, or ones who fell victim of wealth seeking pirates.

One such person was Captain Crookback. His name brought fear into the most ruthless and evil of men, turning them into cowardly mice from the most powerful of the dragons they seemed to be. He knew no forgiveness, had no friends, no family. It was just him, his crew, and his loot. Nothing else was meaningful. Well, except the commanding voices inside of his head that were guiding him, perhaps it was them that gave him the kind of power he had, deciding his every move, but that we may never know.

The captain arrives on a small island. The bright moon hovered above the night sky, guiding sailors to their destinations, their guardian angel. The air feels fine, soft like silk, and the air is warm and smells of rum and the ocean. He arrives, the group of men step off the boat. The locals seem friendly, poor but friendly, barely a community. Crookback taps one local on the back, asking him for the nearest inn. After he answers, he moves off with his crew, without a response. The group of men approach the inn, already drunk and singing. It is well lit and the air now smells of fresh pork and ale. Crookback swings open the door, entering like a giant moving across a sleeping village, and people start turning their heads and zooming in onto him over their shoulders. Silence fills the room, but quickly enough the noise resumes, however it is quieter now than before, like the whispers of demons.

The crew and their captain take a seat, asking the bartender for rum and start to sing. The moonlight fills the inn, shimming through the cracks in the straw roof. The night seems to be going good until a short man steps slowly from his table, also wearing a pointed pirate hat, but less worn out with more vibrant colours. Tapping Crookback on the shoulder says ""Ye bloody scurvy dog! You're no buccaneer like me ya damned sprog! Can't even control ye crew. Make them settle or I'll take matters into me hands"". Silence fills the air. Only rough coughs now and then appear out of the blue. Local men and women slowly start to leave the inn, but several men in striped clothes stay at their tables, their cutlass' at hand.

Crookback says nothing and continues to sip on his dark brown rum, the only noise that is in the room at the moment. The man taps him a second time shouting ""Didn't ya hear me! Ignore me will ye? Fine, fight me with ye sword and see who is the real master of the sea!"". Crookback rises from his seat, turns around slowly and calmly says ""Oh were ye talking to me lad? Wanted to duel me did ye?"" Crookback starts to laugh, his crew along with him. Crookback approaches the man and whispers into his ear with an echoing demonic voice ""Back off or I'll send ye to Davy Jones's Locker."" The other man starts to slowly laugh, but only him, not his crew. He starts reaching for his glimmering sword, the angellic moonlight being reflected onto Crookback's eyepatch. Other men sitting at their tables behind the small man start to rise and bring out their cutlasses. The captains crew rise like and army, backing him. The deadly silence fills the room and all souls are silenced, until Crookback shouts ""Lets give it to them lads!"" and all Hell is let loose. Screams of men dying and their souls leaving their bodies overload the inn, rust coated swords striking together bounce off the walls like bullets ricocheting, and legs slamming onto the fragile floor roar like drums. Bottles smash against walls and floors leaving puddles of alcohol, tables and chairs thrown like cannon balls, and the two captains standing in the middle of the room staring each other down like a western duel. Crookback starts to lift his eye patch, taking his time, putting on a small vile smile. What is revealed tremors the ground. Underneath, fire, blazing hot, and the spirits of Hell start to escape. The other captain shivers in terror, shook and paralysed into a human statue, his eyes filled horrors that cannot be unseen by any man, demons, death, and destruction. Crookbacks crooked smile turns into a frown of hatred, and he slashes at the man. He is black spotted. He falls to the floor, and the rival crew still battling Crookbacks sailors turn and flee at the sight of their guardian angel which had been slain. They flee like sheep with no one to guide them, mindlessly fleeing for their lives.

The inn is now coated with blood and piled up with bodies, tables and chairs scattered throughout the battlefield that was once a peaceful place where life thrived. Crookbacks eye patch is now covered and his men cheer for him like a crowd at a gladiator battle. Finishing off their grog the men leave the inn, not leaving a single coin while the bartender stands in silence like stone, and they head for their Jolly Roger, fitted with six pounders, stacked with piles of doubloons, gems, and all other sorts of treasures. The guiding, golden sun starts to rise, glimmering on the stretching horizon like a chest full of golden coins. The crew leave the port, Crookback holding a ragged map studying it while the crew sing.",Balling101

To be more specific, they grab Pope Francis and the leader of ISIS...",SirFluffyTheTerrible,"""Oh hey guys, we're from the invisible phase-differentiated civilization geographically located in what you would call Antarctica"" said Stpmorp.

""I suppose that makes you aliens to us"" mused Pope Francis.

""Not to me!  I knew they were there all along, what I don't know is why they've taken us here!"" Said Amun-Ra.

""Well I instructed my cohorts to abduct Pope Francis and the leader of ISIS to explain why there are still organized religions at your stage of development"" explained Stpmorp.

""Huh, you probably should have said ISIL to avoid confusion, technically being the king of the Egyptian gods I am the leader of Isis but probably not the ISIS who you were thinking of"" said Amun-Ra.

""Oh, well I was going to tell you that most of advanced civilizations abandon religion because there's no such things as God or gods but that seems rather pointless seeing as how I'm talking to a god.  This is quite troubling."" exhorted Stpmorp.

""That's quite all right my child, feel free to come by anytime and discuss it.""  said Pope Francis.

""Wait, doesn't it bother you that an Egyptian god is sitting right there next to you?  Doesn't that in itself mean that your religion is false?"" asked Stpmorp?

""What?  Don't be ridiculous!  Don't you realize how much modern Christianity was shaped by the polytheistic religions of the past?  Saviors, resurrections, codes of ethics, the same stories getting told over and over again?  Catholicism isn't original for Christ's sake!  We didn't invent religion we just perfected it!""  insisted Pope Francis.

""Oh sheesh!""  blew out an exasperated Amun-Ra.

""But, but the ancient Egyptian creation myth differs from yours, you can't both be right!""  chortled Stpmorp.

""They're basically the same, you can't take that stuff literally anyways!""  responded Pope Francis.

""But if you can just say something can't be taken literally there can be no logical arguments about it!""  shouted Stpmorp!

""Exactly!"" Amun-Ra and Pope Francis responded in unison.

Then Stpmorp began to shake uncontrollably before shattering into his core constituent molecules.  His literal-minded cohorts began zipping around directionless waiting for direction.

""Hey uh, can you cohorts put us back where you got us from?  I've got a dinner party to get to at Vishnu's place, I want to get there before Adephagia and Beelzebub eat all the food."" asked Amun-Ra.

""YES.""  the cohorts responded.

""Oh they're completely literal thinkers, you have to tell them to do it, not just ask them if they can."" said Pope Francis in an annoyed tone.  ""Will my lord be at the Dinner party?""

""Jesus Christ?  Well yes, because he's everywhere, but I don't really talk to him.  Okay Cohorts put us back where you found us!""  commanded Amun-Ra.  ",MackTUTT

"[WP] A group of aliens is baffled by the fact we still have organized religions at this stage of development. To get answers, they abduct two spiritual leaders for questioning. To be more specific, they grab Pope Francis and the leader of ISIS...",SirFluffyTheTerrible,"Pope Francis sat patiently in the empty room where the aliens had left him. He was quite a bit calmer than he expected most abductees would have been, but he had faith that the Lord would see him through this. He did wish they hadn't abducted him in the middle of his speech, though. There had been quite the crowd, and it was being broadcast worldwide. He had little doubt there would be quite a bit of panic after this, and one way or another that sort of thing usually resulted in people getting hurt.

As he began to muse over what the theological implications of the existence of aliens might be, the door opened and the being he presumed to be his captor walked in. Its body and was very similar to that of a snake, with shining yellow scales and an intricate pattern of green running down the back. Unlike snakes, though, this alien had two arms ending in surprisingly soft-looking four-fingered hands. It closed the door and coiled itself up on the other side of the room before beginning to speak.

""Your Holiness,"" it said. Francis was surprised that it both spoke his language and was using his proper address. ""My species has been studying yours for some time now. We've brought you here to resolve an issue we've been unable to understand.""

The Pope wondered what question a species advanced enough for space travel would need him to answer.

""Your species has made great advancements in science and technology. You've even sent members of your own kind into space. And yet, your people still worship gods. Why?""

It looked like those theological implications were going to be a lot more than just musing. Explaining his faith to aliens was not something he had considered before, but he was going to give it a shot.

""There is only one God, and we worship him because He gives us strength through our faith. The courage to do what is right. He inspires us to be better than what we are.""

""But look at your advancements. The marvels you've wrought with technology. What do you need of a god's power when you have your own?""

Francis thought this was a strange reply. What did technology have to do with the Lord? He wondered if there had been some sort of miscommunication. Perhaps if he could find some common ground.

""Tell me, what do your people believe in?"" the Pope asked.

""You didn't answer my question,"" it said.

""I will answer it, but I could explain it better if I could put it in more familiar terms.""

""Very well. Our people don't believe in anything. All that exists is what can be seen.""

""You have never considered that there might be things beyond your comprehension?""

The alien seemed impatient. ""We did once. We worshipped gods in the heavens to gain their power like you do. But as our species advanced, we gained power of our own. We used this power to destroy our gods.""

The Pope was taken aback by this statement. ""Why would you want to destroy your gods? And for that matter, how?""

""Our gods were cruel. They gave us fractions of their power, then turned us against each other. Friend against friend. Brother against brother. Wars that ravaged the land for their petty ends. But we developed our own technology and gained power of our own. We cut down the gods on our planet, and we found their home in the heavens and destroyed that too.""

Francis understood now. Their gods were false; a more advanced race that used their technology to appear divine. It had certainly happened on Earth more than once. ""I see. But our God is not like that,"" Francis began. The alien interrupted him.

""That's not how the other human saw it,"" it said. ""He was certain that his god commanded him to kill those who follow other gods. Even those who worshiped his god but did it in the wrong way were to be killed.""

Francis was concerned he may have angered his interrogator. ""Who is this man?""

""His name is hard for me to say, but he leads a group called 'ISIS'.""

The Pope sighed. The aliens interviewed *Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi*. That sounded like a conversation that went swimmingly. He briefly wondered if they had made a recording.

""Yes, we have had many like him, and we will likely have many more. Many would commit violence in the name of our Lord. But that does not mean He wills it. The Lord's message has always been the same: love your neighbor as yourself.""

""A god that wants you to be peaceful?"" The alien paused to consider this. ""But what would he gain from followers who don't fight for him?""

""The Lord doesn't want to gain anything. He only wants us to love him, and each other, the way He loves us.""

Again, the alien stopped to consider Francis's words. ""You believe your god loves you?""

""Yes.""

""All of you?""

""Yes. Unconditionally.""

""Even those people who don't follow his message? Those who kill in his name?""

The Pope smiled. ""We are all sinners. Perhaps some more than others. But He loves us all the same.""

For a third time, the alien pondered the Pope's words. ""A god who wants nothing from his followers,"" it said to itself. ""A god who loves even those who disobey him. A god who loves all..."" it trailed off into thought.

Then the alien spoke again. ""Does He love me?""

This theological implication Francis *had* considered. ""Of course. He loves all His creation.""

""I see,"" the alien said. ""Then I have another question for you.""

""What is it, my child?"" Francis replied.

""Could you tell me about your Lord and Savior Jesus Christ?""

The Pope happily obliged.

Well, that's my attempt at this. It's been a while since I looked at Catholic theology, so I'm curious if I slipped any heresy in there by accident.

So far it had not responded to his frightened pleas for help in German, or Italian. It occurred to him that perhaps this individual spoke English... His English was not very good. 

It was then that he heard a strange, alien voice speaking to him, as if from inside of his head.

Xenu: ""Explain to us...."" The voice is cut off as a violent explosion, and a series of loud cracks are heard, followed by an alarm buzzing worryingly. (The space ship jerks violently)...

Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, having made his last prayer to Allah, detonated his hidden suicide vest, killing six Grey aliens in the room with him, and destroying part of the outer hull. 

Moments later the UFO cracks in half and burns up as it reenters Earth's atmosphere. 

A young child struggling to find sleep in the heat, looks up through the open roof of her mortared house and sees what looks like a shooting star. 

She prays for peace, and for Syria. 

She prays for her little brother, who she saw die when the roof caved in. 

She prays for her mother, who she can hear weeping quietly on the cot next to her.

In modern times it's downright awesome.",SirFluffyTheTerrible,"*""Who are you, who enters my lair without invitation? Be ye thief, after my gold? Perhaps another adventurer, wishing for naught but the glory of my death?""* 

My voice rolled around the stone chamber like fire and thunder as one, echoing off the walls with a deep rumble. The effect pleased me, and I pulled back my lips into an ember-painted snarl. 

""Nay, oh dragon of the depths."" Called the shadowy figure. A man, I knew from his voice=, but his form was obscured by darkness and cloak until I could only guess at his appearance.


*""Nay?""* I chuckled, sending waterfalls of dust cascading down from the ancient ceiling. *""Perhaps you seek my friendship then? You desire assistance in the war? Or perhaps a little ride to a distant land. All are well within my power. Come, step into the light that I may see you.""* My words were warm honey, filled with malice and mercy all at once, Dragoncraft at it's finest. No mortal could resist my whims.


""No, I think not, great one."" 


I shuffled my wings, rising from my golden throne with a clattering of coins. 


*""No? You begin to try my patience, little man. Why have you come? My curiosity is all that keeps you alive, sate it before I decide that you vex me more than you interest me.*"" 

""I have come to end your tyranny, oh dragon. But I have not come to end your life, far from it.""


I laughed again, shaking the coins at my feet like an earthquake. *""What do you presume do, woo me?""* I roared with laughter, scattering gold and jewels alike. 


""Of course not, dragon. Your scaly hide is of no interest to me."" 


Instantly, my laughter turned to fury in my belly, and in turn to fire in my maw. I unleashed a torrent of hellfire at the figure, scorching the earth and slagging a number of coins into rivulets of gold. To my surprise, when I closed my mouth the figure still stood in a circle of char and molten metal. 

*""What sorcery is this?""* I reared back, shocked that my flames had failed me. 


""It is your undoing."" The figure replied, calmly. Violent green light erupted from his body, outstripping even my flames in brightness. The man began to chant, words unfamiliar to even my lengthy memory, and the light waxed even further, threatening to fill the entire chamber with their ghastly hue. 

Panic filled my heart, and I let fly even more of my flame. But it was to no avail. My vision turned to green, and then black. 

When I awoke, the chamber had grown. A vast, elegant ceiling arced overhead, and the gold that I had taken for my bed piled up into a veritable mountain of wealth. I groaned softly, and was concerned to find that my voice was little more than a whisper of what it had been before. 

""What...what's going on?"" I asked. My concern turned into dismay as my voice came out not with a noise like distant thunder, but rather akin to tinkling bells. 

With a moment of shock, I realized that the man was right next to me, looming over me like a giant. I twisted, opening my mouth to let loose a torrent of fire at his body...but nothing came. 

""Uurp."" I said, and covered my mouth in dismay. At least I still had my claws. 

""I intended to turn you into a newt, but it seems that you were mightier than I anticipated."" The man grimaced. Up close, I noticed that his cheeks seemed to be rather red.

""Here, put this on. Lucky I had a spare."" He tossed me a robe, matching his own. 


""Why should I..."" I glanced down to my horde, and happened upon a shining mirror of polished brass. Staring back at me was a woman, very young and - if I was being honest - rather fetching. I cocked my head to one side, and was dismayed to find that she did the same. 


""...Oh hell."" Realization poured over me like a cold shower.


""Yep. You better come with me, unless you seriously think you can kill even a deer as you are now.""


I pondered this for a moment, then said ""Fine."" I pulled the robe over my head, resolving to kill the man in his sleep at the first chance we got. 


""And don't even think about killing me in my sleep. If you do, you will never get your old body back."" 


Rats.

2000 years later, and I found myself lounging on gold once again. Well, gold colored leather at least. Much more comfortable than coins. 

""Morgan, could you get me another beer?"" I called. ""I'm nearly out again!"" 


""You know, you could get it yourself sometimes."" The young man countered, handing me a can nonetheless. He was wearing a hooded leather jacket, despite the warm June weather


""Yeah, but then what would I keep you around for?"" I grinned at him. ""You know, you should really do something about your leather thing. You are going to get strange stares. Get with the times!"" 


I cracked open the can and threw back my head, downing it in one giant gulp. 


Yep. Much more comfortable than a pile of gold.

"[WP] The threat has been elimitated. A united humanity has pushed the alien menace back into its home sector, then home system, then home world. As the glassed surface of their planet begins to cool, old animosity resurfaces among the victorious mankind almost immediately.",cheshire_cattywampus,"The great Alliance died the same day the last Verron was burned along with their home world. The three great Human powers; *The Terran Empire (TE)*, * The Great Human Imperium (GHI)* and the *New Terra Republic (NTR)* had crushed the alien force that had threatened to destroy them all.  After 30 years, hundreds of billions dead and an almost unparallel amount of devastation they had finally won. It had taken the complete destruction of the forth and now lost *Terran Colonies* that included Earth before the other powers put their petty issues to one side and joined forces to defend against the onslaught.  

United they had defeated one of the single biggest threats the galaxy had faced but people have long memories and age old grudges remained under the surface.

In orbit above the Verron home world, what was left of it, the Human fleet was a mixture of ships from all three powers. The first indication that something was going wrong was when NTR heavy cruisers that had been assigned to protect the TE battleships targeted them and opened fire. At such close range and with no warning the TE ships, although far larger took serious damage before they could react. Partial beams cut into their armoured hulls spilling atmosphere and crew into space. Reactors breached and ships exploded. Within seconds the largest ships in the fleet laying damaged and crippled beyond use.

Almost immediately ships from both groups opened fire on each other as the space between them erupted with missiles and energy weapons. Fighter craft weaved among hulls and wreckage in high speed dog fights.  At almost point blank range the capital ships pounded each other. Like broadside battles from Earth ancient navy’s the craft blasted each other. Entire sections blasted into space with some ships getting caught in the explosions of others as reactors or anti-matter storage units breached.

GHI forces watched in horror as former allies became engulfed the onslaught. In the melee it was inevitable some of their ships took hits and then returned fire. Before long GHI ships were firing at both sides.

Ships started taking evasive manoeuvres as the fleet began spliting into three groups.  Those craft cut off from the bulk of their forces were cut to pieces surrounded by now, enemy ships.

TE forces were seriously out numbered. They had mainly contributed the battleships in the fleet and with most of them now out of action the remaining cruisers found themselves out gunned and quickly picked off. GHI forces were the technologically superior force but lacked the numbers to make it count. They could just about hold their own. It was the NTR that had the numbers and it was starting to show. Before long it was a slugging match between the NTR and GHI. The too old enemies locked in a fire fight off attrition.

The NTR flagship was a super battleship called the *Vengeance*, 24 million tons of guns and armour which cut swaths through the GHI fleet.  As its partial beams targeted capital ships, waves of missiles from its launchers targeted and destroyed everything from fighters to cruisers.

As the remaining TE force attempted to fend off another wave of missile cruiser fire they detached a contact, a massive contact.  Within seconds it opened a rip in hyper space and slid into normal space right in the middle of them. The spatial disputation caused the craft to explode as the fabric of space ripped open and returned to normal.

The monstrous hulk of the GHI *Leviathan* roared toward the NTR fleet. The one-of-a-kind *mega dreadnaught* was an experimental ship which had missed the last attack against the Verron and was meant to be a surprise addition to the fleet. While in hyper space they had witnessed what was happening and had come up to battle readiness and they came out shooting. The 50 million ton behemoth let loose a myriad of fire power. Within the first 30 seconds 12 NTR ships lay burning and the *Leviathan* targeted the NTR flag ship *Vengeance*.

The *Leviathan* was armed with truely titanic rail gun running the length of 5km long ship.  It send a dense metallic alloy kinetic energy slug at half the speed of light into the bow of the *Vengeance*, the impact was fatal. The slug tore into the 15 meters of forward armour at a slight downward angle. It ploughed thought deck after deck, bulkhead after bulkhead before punching out through the rear armour below the engineering section. The *Vengeance* was decimated in a massive blast as the *Leviathan* rode through the shock wave and debris field, its weapons continued to target any and all non-friendly ships as it continued onward undeterred by the impacts of missile and partial fire, the 40 meter thick armour soaked up everything thrown at it.

It was a small TE frigate that brought the leviathans run to an end. Engaging its FTL engines it turned itself into a 250,000 battering ram and slammed into the side of the mega dreadnaught. Nothing could protect the ship from the force impact and both ships became enveloped in a ball of light as whatever powered the huge ship went critical. The blast wave ripped through the remained battling ships sending whole craft spinning in oblivion.

As the cloud of super heated plasma began to spread and dissipate out those ships fortunate to escape took the lull to make best their escape. Many found themselves now behind enemy lines and were likely never to make it home knowing fine well if they had succumbed to the grudges of old then this was likely being repeated in worlds across the once great Alliance. Mankind had returned to it's old ways.

And finally... well, we'll get to that.

The point is, that's what we tell them. We tell them a lot of things.

Who are 'we'? We're the ones usually called 'they'. As in, *they don't* want *you to know*.

There's a young man sitting in front of me. He's shackled to the steel table, with handcuffs thick as a freighter's anchor chain. He's naked, and blindfolded. He's crying.

I glance at his file. Dark hair, light eyes. Right frame, or close enough so that it doesn't matter. Not bad. An easy one, for once.

A careless gesture from me, and the blindfold is yanked off of him. High cheekbones. Aquiline nose. Pretty. That makes it even easier.

He looks at me. I see the flash of anger peek out from behind the fear. 

That won't do. I tap the red button to my left.

Electricity pops and crawls across him, dancing and blue. He shrieks, but I've been told I'm a well-insulated person.

As soon as he's caught his breath, I ask the question.

""Do you know why you're here, Mr. Robinson?""

He glares at me. That's fine.

""You lifted a truck yesterday, Mr. Robinson. *Stopped it*, first, then lifted it. To save... a child?"" -I flipped through the papers, found the photo, a toddler with yellow ringlets and a striped blue jumper- ""Remarkable. Laudable. You risked everything. You didn't think you could stop it, did you?"" 

His surprised face neatly matches those in the surveillance shots. 

Security cameras. It's made my life simpler and harder in equal measure.

I showed him more photographs. The truck, bumper bowing around his hand like unfired clay, the child, tear-streaked eyes open wide- ""But you tried... *Succeeded.* You didn't know what you were, but you tried anyway. You saved her. You did a good thing."" I thumped the file oratorially. ""Ready to do another?""

""Who... who *are*-""

""The scary people in the dark. Does it matter?""

""*Yes*.""

I grin. ""Of course it matters. We're the black helicopters outfit. We're government.""

""Wh-which *government?*""

I smiled again. ""Pick one.""

He stared at me. ""I don't want you to be USA. I have rights.""

I pointed at him. ""Maybe. Maybe you have rights. Read any of the new laws coming from Capitol Hill lately? No, what you *definitely* have is a problem. You, my friend, are a *superhero*.""

He stared at me, blankly. For a guy who'd just been drugged and tossed into a van, he was pretty on-point, but I could see I'd just lost him.

""Superhero. Tights, capes, leap tall buildings? You know, superhero.""

""That's... *impossible*!"" he breathed. ""I'm no alien! No... no greek god or-""

""Neither are they.""

He stopped. I talked on. ""None of them. All of them are just like you. The older ones were *several* just like you.""

I could practically see the wheels turning furiously in his head. ""**Bullshit**.""

""Do you know what can kill one of them?""

The question shook him from his reverie. ""Well, a big explosion? Um, radiation?""

""Sure, sure..."" I nodded, ""that's all true. Just like they teach in high-school science. There's one more, though.""

""...Strangulation?""

I couldn't help smiling again. I liked this one. ""Ah. You were an *honor student*, then. No, not that. We keep this one secret...""

He was listening closely, I could tell.

""You wait five years.""

He blinked, uncomprehendingly.

""Five years, and then what?""

""That's it. Five years. Being Powered means you can bench-press a semi, that you can laugh off a howitzer to the face. It means you can heal just about *any injury*. It also means you die in five years. Incredible power, mortal frame. You *burn out*. It...*hurts.* A lot. An awful lot. ...We'll help with that, if you let us. We can make you comfortable.""

His eyes narrowed, lips thinned. ""Wait. Wait, that doesn't make sense! There are super-teams that have been together for decades! And the big names have been around even longer!""

I shrugged. ""Lemme ask you a question: did you ever *really believe* that 'secret identity' malarkey? How long would it really take before their cover was blown, in this world of radio trackers and smartphones?""

His expression was unreadable. His tone was that of slow, awful realization. ""Face-covering masks. Coming back from the dead all the time.""

""Alternate earths, other dimensions, all of that. Yep, you put your finger on it! All us. We don't normally tell anyone this, since the newcomers on the scene usually end up passing away before they get too popular, but the big ones...""

He was grasping at straws now. ""How could... how could you *keep this from us?!*""

""What, that we're sorry the nigh-unkillable superbeings have inescapable expiration dates, but we'd really appreciate it if they didn't break anything, and by so doing disturb the normal people who actually have full happy lives to live? That they shouldn't get any ideas about, say, ripping off *Fort Knox*, or *killing someone*, knowing they'll never do more than a *nickel* in prison?! Or get any *political aspirations*?""

I gave him a old look.

""Something like *that?*""

He winced. I'd made my point.

Then, confusion. Something bothered him. ""But... You just said you don't tell newbies this. Why tell me?""

I tossed him another photo. This one was of a face everyone knew, but wan and drawn with wasting disease. His piercing blue eyes were sucked back into his skull, and the classic spitcurl of hair lay flat and limp upon his damp brow. He was lying in a hospital bet. The sheets were blue. The curtains were red and yellow.

""We don't let the old ones die. We get... new actors. You're him. A little nip here, tuck there... we can do that. You'll get classes. Diction. Kinematics.""

""You want me, to replace Su-"" He growled. 

""-A *replacement*, yes. He wasn't the original, either. He was one of ours. It was either that, or we put him down. Too powerful. Either you're ours, or you're liquidated. It's the only way to be sure.""

""You're saying I **belong to you?!**""

I could feel him getting angry. A near-silent beep warned me that his muscles, swelling from rage, were starting to crack the shackles. I needed to make this quick, get out of here before they flooded the room with gas-

""The *alternative being*,"" I said, speaking too quickly ""that you let the world go without one of the most potent symbols of heroism *ever conceived*. It's better than being a lab rat."" I knew it was the wrong thing to say a half-second too late.

I'd pushed him too far.

With a roar, he shattered the shackles. I felt myself get pelted with razor-sharp shards of metal. They pulverized the cinderblock walls, kicking up puffs of white dust. 

One struck my naked eye. I cried out, then curled into a ball.  I felt, rather than heard as from every wall, a door or hidden hatch sprang open, and from each came a swarm of taser darts.

I felt myself get pulled roughly to my feet, as the poor subject fell to his knees.

""You alright. sir?""

""No, dammit! I'm injured! Secure the prisoner. I'm going to casualty!"" I yelled into his ear, louder than necessary.

""Sir!"" He saluted smartly, and I left before he could finish turning around.

An eye injury. It didn't even hurt, but that was shock for you, right? How bad was it? I had to know...

I ducked into a bathroom, then gingerly uncovered my eye...

It was perfectly intact. Not a mar, not a scratch. 

But that was impossible! I'd seen what the shrapnel had done to the wall, and- wait...

I pulled out my penknife, unfolded it, and pressed the point into my palm.

The blade snapped off like peanut brittle. My hand was unharmed.

""Shit!"" I breathed. 

""I'm a fucking superhero?!""

And in the first few months, it had been. Men of steel, women of pure energy, and everything in between, taking up the mantle of 'protectors of earth'

Everyone was safe. Happy.

But we all know nothing good can last forever, and within six months, the world learnt the truth.

It was a death sentence. Using the powers - no one could have known. It was... Killing them; it was painful. 

The first Hero, I can't remember his name; he sent a message to the world 'we're dying' and then just... faded away. 

After each of their deaths, their identities were made public, some were accountants, some were police officers, all of them were the best humanity had to offer when it mattered. 

They worked round the clock - any means necessary, to save the lives of the people who gave up theirs. But nothing worked.
From the moment the powers manifest, till they take over the host, and finally return to the earth - just six months. But still they fought. Because they were the best, the best of humanity, even before they were chosen. The people who would stand up and fight, even in the face of certain death. Even if it was just to save a cat out of a tree. 

They were good people. They were all dead. And all hope seemed lost. ",unrelenting_boat

"[WP] You've just developed a superpower! Unfortunately, developing a superpower is a death sentence similar to a terminal illness. Over time, the power will grow out of control and destroy your body.",iasserteddominanceta,"I had never felt such rage in my entire life. She sat there, blonde, stupid Elena, yapping away in the middle of an English *exam*. My eyes met the invigilator and she gave me nothing but a crooked smile in response.I let my gaze drift back to the paper once more and I attempted to put pen to my test, but hearing loud, stupid Elena trying to grab the attention of her friend in front. I dropped the pen and looked around, almost as if searching for a common distaste among the other students, and I found nothing, nothing but an accumulation of my own anger.

So I looked at her, fixed my eyes to the back of those shiny golden locks and thought with all of my might, as if a fish to water, as if a bird to air I screamed mentally with all of my might. *Shut up!* Nothing. *Shut up!* I gripped the desk and with an unbridled fury, all of the power in my mind screamed to hers. *Shut. Up!* Like a circuit being completed, a feeling of satisfaction rode over me. As if the stars had aligned, as if I had heard the click when the door had locked. Whatever I had done, I had succeeded. Her gaze fell to mine in a single instant, her eyes wide with fright and her jaw hanging like an uneven hinge. I couldn't believe it myself, but now that I had a taste, I sent another message. *You will turn around, and you will shut up.* I paused for a moment, but still she sat. I couldn't exactly differentiate the success of the message with her inane disregard for the order - no that was wrong. I could. I could feel that *click*, a click as if relaying morse code. *You will turn around, and you will shut up.* I paused again. No click. Nothing, no feedback, and still she sat, jaw agape and doe eyed. Intolerable bitch. I focused again, I gripped my pen with such force I felt the plastic splinter in my hand, heat welled inside me, and with one more thoughtful projection of my wrath, I screamed once more. ***You will turn around, and you will shut up!*** She jolted. This time she did, and I sat back in my chair.

It had been two months since that day, Elena had scurried off after the exam, and I couldn't exactly blame her. I could hardly believe the events myself. Ever since that moment, I had fruitlessly conjured all of my mental strength to relay those messages, and each time I had failed. On close friends, family and in a last ditch attempt even animals. *Nothing* worked, no matter how hard I focused, even if I tried to consciously trigger that **click**, I found myself unable to replicate the ability. Up until now, I had forgotten, I pushed the thought of ever having such a silly ability into the back of my mind. Today, I got the results of my exams, I had failed each and every one.  Blonde, stupid Elena.

""Ricky."" A voice boomed out to me when I opened the front door. ""Your results."" I shut the door behind me and tentatively stepped inside of the living room, a dark and musty smell hit me, but the familiarity of it was enough to keep me from flinching. My father sat in the armchair, belly flopping out of his shirt, facing the TV and not so much as even glancing in my direction. I attempted to mumble, fidgeting the card in my hands, eyes drawn to my shoes. ""Your. Results. Ricky."" He spat, and only slowly cranked his head to try and meet mine, but only to let out a grunt when I looked away. In the corner of my eye, I saw him extend his hand. I knew not to hesitate, and stepped forward, meekly dropping the card into his palm and stepping back. I pivoted on my heels and made for the stairs, but I heard that familiar *crack* of leather.

""What in the fuck are you doing boy?"" To let out a shriek was a sign of fear. Father did not like fear. I turned to look, and he had already bore down on me, pushed me to the floor and began to smash the belt into my face relentlessly. ""I house you, I feed you, and you fuck around in class. You goof off and sit in your room playing with your cock, whilst I slave each and every day for your miserable, sorry existence?!"" The next thwack of the belt very nearly beat my nose out of shape. I tried to push back, but he was too strong - or rather too fat - this time he was going to kill me. I shut my eyes and focused, those thoughts of relaying messages poured into my mind once more, I balled my fists, and before the neck swing of leather I felt it. I felt that **click**, I had nothing to say yet, did I need to be quick? Was there a time limit in between **clicks**?

*Why don't people like you go and kill themselves?*

Father stopped soon after, he left me to sob and lick my own wounds. It wasn't the worst he had beaten me, not by a long shot. I slept there, too weak, both in mind and body to do all else. When I woke up the next day, covered in dry blood and tears, I looked up at the ceiling and saw a fat, aging man. Hanging.

I called the ambulance. Of course he had died, but it were more of a courtesy. The police came to question me. At first they tried to home me with a foster family. **Click** I could live alone, I'm a special case. They couldn't offer me financial support? **Click** That changed. I had to attend that fat cunts funeral? **Click**

Bar having some new scars, I was happy enough. Content to sit on my own in the house. Content enough to go back to school when it was time for term. Oh, and there she was, once again sitting in front of me with those doe eyes and that blonde hair. Oh, Blonde, stupid Elena. 

""Elena, dear, could you come up to the board and finish this equation?"" I had never seen such a better opportunity. She stood up, walked to the board and grabbed  the chalk delicately as she always did, carving out her answer. **CLICK** More powerful this time. Her hand twisted from numbers, instead she marked on the board *I am a twat!* The class erupted in laughter, almost in praise for *her*. I only snickered when the teacher sent her out, and she stepped toward the door **CLICK** *Numb Legs*. She fell flat on her face.

I followed her. For weeks, for months. I made each moment of her school life a living hell. **Click** Put your homework in the bin and forget about it. **Click** Break up with your boyfriend. **Click** Don't sleep tonight. I had broken her. Her golden locks had become nothing but wire rag wool, bags under her eyes that no make up could hide. She stank of sweat, piss and apathy. Still, I followed her, issuing my orders to her tirelessly. 

""I know it's you."" She shook violently, cornering me in the men's bathroom during break. ""I-I know you're the one making that constant clicking...that voice in my head. Y-you did it in the exam..."" I said nothing, no need to deny it now. She was mine, my toy to do with as I pleased. Out of her bag she produced a screwdriver. It was fun whilst it lasted. **C-click** Kill yourself. It shot out through my head like a migraine, for a split second my vision went blurry. That 'click' wasn't right, did I mess up?

Either way, blonde stupid Elena lay dead, screwdriver in her temple. I needed to leave before I seriously got into trouble. 

The corridor was covered in blood. Dozens died. Heads smashed against walls, pencils jammed into eyeballs, some still twitched. Blonde stupid Elena. If not for confronting me this wouldn't have happened. Perhaps little by little I had advanced too much. **C-click** Shallow idiots had it coming. I ran to the office, had to feign as if I had walked in one this site.

I burst through the door, put on my best panicked expression and whimpered. **Click** I killed everybody in the hallway! Their eyes widened. **Click** I didn't mean to say that, wait, that wasn't me 'clicking'. **Click** All of you, forget what I said! They turned back to their desks and I fled back to the corridor, growling and hissing **Click** I have to get a hold of this. Blood ran out of my nose. Students had gathered, screaming at the site of blood. **Click** What if I kill them too? They looked at me and stopped, began to turn and run. **Click**Shit don't run, I didn't mean that! It started to hurt, each click rang throughout my skull like a bell, each click made me weak at the knees, each click broke my spirit, each click made me like blonde stupid Elena.  **Click** Back on your feet, Ricky. I stood. **Click**Get of here, Ricky. Keep issuing commands, I can't move alone any more, I need the clicks. **Click** Get your things at home, Ricky.

Burst through the front door, grabbed a bag and threw my clothes in callously, blood dripped from my nose like the Niagra. **Click**Stop bleeding. The pour stopped. I wiped my brow and continued packing. **Click** Ricky, call a cab, Ricky? The room spun, was I drunk? Was I high? Was I? **Click** You're not dying, Ricky. **Click** Get back up Ricky. **Click** Keep your heart beating, Ricky. The room shook violently, or perhaps I did.**Click**Beat, Heart. One pulse. Not another. **Click**Beat, Heart. **Click**Beat Heart. The beats weren't fast enough. My tongue rang out with sharp pain. I finally tasted the blood, I finally tasted my own lack of control. I finally slept. 

**Click** Goodnight Ricky.",Daveclap

It was an exhausting way to die. His arms were wrinkled like empty plastic bags, his body having eaten his once herculean physique to almost nothing. He could barely think. His brain wasn't getting the right type of sugar. He remembered this. He was a bit fuzzy on what sugar his brain needed or why he was thinking of his grandmother, but he remembered that he wasn't getting enough of the right kind. 

He wanted to sleep, but he was afraid. Afraid that the moment he closed his eyes he would cease to be. He didn't want to face death. He'd seen death. He'd seen dead children and he'd brought their killers to justice. The justice always felt hollow. As hollow as his body. 

He looked at the clock.

He looked at his life. 

He was thirty years old. He'd spent half of that time fighting crime, working with the police and super-hero groups. He lifted cars and stopped bullets with his bare hands... and now he was fighting for the energy not to close his eyes. 

He snapped his eyes open. He didn't remember closing them. He glared at the clock, trying to focus. Trying to remember.

Maybe it's already driven me mad and that's why you're here.

-I'm here because this thing showed itself way earlier than I predicted.  Now I have to take the rest of you, judge everyone while I'm at it, and find a new world that's far away from this thing.

Sorry to question you, but you can't stop this thing?  

-Not in any way that I know of.  It's just too big.

See, that's what gets me.  This thing is beneath you, right?  Can you not kill it because it's just not of our dimension?  You know, like how a 3d creature would be incomprehensible to a 2d creature?  Likewise with this?

-There is no such thing as a dimension.  A flat plane only seems of two dimensions to you because your vision is based on organs in your head.  In reality, a flat plane itself consist of a line of atoms, each with their own width, length, and height.  This thing is no more ""dimensional"" than you or me.

Then how is this thing too big for you to kill?

-Think of it as a germ.  A rough description for a complex animal like this, but bear with me.  Evolution ensures that the creature takes as much as it can without killing the host, but if a parasite attacks the wrong host, all bets are off.  Humanity saw that firsthand with the black death, HIV, ebola.  Picture a 10 foot tapeworm attempting to live in the belly of a gnat.  The gnat is beyond saving.  Not because the tapeworm is too large for you to kill, but because the delicate host has already lost.",eldritchSyntax

[CW] Describe Cthulhu in a way that makes him feel truly massive,ifuckingwriteprompts,"“No doctor, I’m not buying it. Explain to me why that monster is such a big threat. It’s smaller than Gamera, hell, it looks like a boat could pierce it. What is the big deal? I don’t see why everyone is so scared out of their minds.” 

James and the doctor were looking at the coast from the safety of the laboratory window, while the coast guard and the Mechas went to meet the monster that right now was drawing closer and closer to the city. The thing was covered by a deep, heavy mist, and the kid could barely see it, a mass of shifting meat and tentacles, wings and limbs spread in all directions. 

“The problem is perception,” explained the old doctor, with a tired voice that James had never heard in him, not even when Mothra destroyed Tokyo by accident last year, “we are simply not equipped to see it, James, I’m afraid.”

“But why,” insisted the kid.

“This is a being from beyond our comprehension, James, born to strange aeons in a  place older than the stars. It is very different than the monsters we are used to.”

The room shook. Or was it James’s imagination?

The doctor grabbed a pen and a sheet of paper, and sat on a nearby table. James followed him, looking over his shoulder to the battle. The Mechas were almost there.

“Imagine that these are alive,” said the doctor, while drawing two cartoon characters in the sheet, “these are two creatures that live in this paper. To them, all that exists is what you can reach by going up, right, left and down. They have no depth, and they know nothing of it. The thought of moving forwards or backwards simply doesn’t exist in their world.” 

James looked intently at the stick figures, and made an effort to imagine himself living like them. His vision was blurry and he had to strain to focus. But he thought he could see it.

“Now look at this,” the doctor said, and put the tip of the pencil in the paper, near the figures, “what do you think they are seeing?”

“Just a dot of ink,” said James, after an effort to focus.

“Good. To them, this pencil is just as big as a little dot of ink, in fact, much smaller than them. But this pencil has height, several centimeters. And this sheet of paper, their entire world, has less than half of one.” 

And he lifted the pencil and placed it to the left of the figures.  To them, James thought, it would’ve looked like the dot had just duplicated, and teleported. But in reality… 

“The dot isn’t the pen at all,” he said, “They can’t even see the true pen.”

“Exactly,” said the doctor, “and what about the person who is holding it? If they can’t even fathom the pen, what about the man who holds it? And what do you think he would see, if he looked at the paper?”

“Just a paper,” answered James, without thinking, even when he had no way of knowing that.

 It was not the room what was shaking, it was the entire world. Outside, in the bay, the Mechas and the entire military had disappeared, and the being in the mist approached.

“Just a paper,” said the doctor, and then tore it to shreds, “nothing, really, and destroying it would just another moment of his day. He would forget about it in five minutes, while doing something important.”

James was silent for a couple of minutes, watching as the beach dissolved into nothingness. 

“What is going to happen to us, doctor?”

“Oh, James,” said the doctor, with sadness, “we were already dead.”

And their faces melted.

The bright orange sun beat down on the bodies of the ragged soldiers that yearned only for home. Lagging behind the group was a single man, staying just a couple of feet away. This man went by the name of Gerald. The young soldier tore the heavy helm from his head. He hadn't an understanding why his commander forced him to keep it upon him all of this time.

Immediately, he heard a rumble. It was not the rumble of a voice, nor was it the projection of a great impact. This rumble tore through Gerald's ears, assaulted his head, and beat upon the door of his heart.

Looming. And obscured by the pillars of stone that held it upright. A great, claggy carcass of green. Untold bounds of viscera steaming from a gape in the bulbous abdomen. As the thing's great flabby arms raked the bluff it cast a ripple of scales into the water, each stout and round like the head of a man. It wobbled, and the mist that obscured the beast dissipated slightly. It heaved against the cliff face and the head, the rotten head, sank into view. Stinking tendrils hung from it, and a pair of distant glinting eyes. The tentacles drew the water about, casting abandoned ships apart and stirring up driftwood and seaweed onto the deck of our own vessel.

The gases building in the thing belched loose, and the wound in its side produced a tremendous gout of offal. The backwash of a partially digested whale, itself draining a generous haul of krill, sprung forth from the guts of the thing, tumbling some way before viciously striking the water.

He has ""skin"" that ""wraps"" around his ""muscles"". He ""stands"" on a ""skeleton"" frame of ""bones"". 

But do not be fooled. The beast is not make of chemical compounds and cells as we are. 

For the beast to know that we live upon this planet is as it would be for you to know there are viruses on a crumb of stale bread. For the beast to know solid rocks orbit this spark of yellow and orange would be as for you to know there are hydrogen atoms bonded to an oxygen atom.  

His heart beat is the silent music of the celestial spheres. His breath is the chain reaction of a hundred thousand supernova. 

At a certain scale things become like liquid. The lines between what is and what is not become blurred and faded like so many tiny chalk scribbles on the pavement by so many naive children unable to tell apart that which they see in reality and that which they see in books and television. 

At a point the question of what is and isn't stops being relevant. If the grains of sand make it a liquid like the atoms of water stops being relevant. If the beast lives and has a mind and body as we do stops being relevant. 

At a point the lines we draw in the sand to make nations and the lines we draw in the sky to make constellations are nothing more than the faded chalk scribbles of a naive child on pavement. 

At a certain scale all things become like liquid. ",PaperTom

The family of hikers stood, shivering in the cold damp mist that soaked them to their cores as out in the ocean, the waters began to churn. In the half-darkness of the twilight, as the quilt of night was drawn over the land as daylight faded, something was moving. It moved with slow, ponderous purpose as it rose, and rose, and rose. A single clawed finger carving grooves into the ocean floor, stirring masses of silt, rock and seaweed from the deep. The water churned with brown-dirt-broth as the white frothing foam of the waters movement was dirtied by the soil of the seafloor being pulled up beneath it.

A single talon rose from the ocean, shearing through the lighthouse that dared challenge it. Crumbling glassed lattice windows, twisted metal girders and thick heavy concrete walls that scattered and beat pitifully against the talon and then fell down and down. More talons joined this lone talon, long curled fingers that scattered aside the mist in a whirlwind of silent motion. Up and up, a long slivering arm of leviathan stature following these claws and fingers, a skyscraper of salt-stained mass marred by scars that coiled around its limb like train tracks. Behind it, the spray of the ocean that rose up and fell down on the earth. The watery deluge seeping down over the Cliffside paths and sweeping the family of hikers down onto the rocks. Their screams unheard through the water, their fragile human forms cracked and twisted upon the rocks as above them, the beast continued to rise.

It's form continued to surface. It had been called, summoned, and it would answer. On and on, the sea running down, rivers like tears against it's form as it pulled itself out of the ocean. Two glittering eyes to rival the moon blotted out by the form it cast. Night falling upon the land in its unnatural shadow as reality twisted, shifted and cracked around its impossible mass. It stepped into the mist, a mountainous cloak that clung to it in thin wisps as its beady black irises deep as tartarus focused on a small hill upon the horizon. One step brought down on the earth, a shuddering boom. An earthquake that brought shattered the world around it, a forest wrought into nothing beneath it's footfall.

A swirling corona of awakened birds that were little more than specks against its majestic leviathan stature even in their thousand-fold flocks that clumped together and fled before its power.

It had been called. It would answer.

Everything started two years ago when my sister died in a car accident. Except, it wasn’t a car accident, but someone cut her brake lines.  I found a month later when an old man, with a deep, craggy face, and a stern expression, approached me in a dark alley. “Your sister was killed” that were his first words. Phantom was his name, an honest man with extraordinary abilities, who tried to help me take revenge for my sister. And I almost did. Almost…

We were fighting together against a common enemy that ruined our lives. The final goal was to reach to a man with no name, but known as the Father. In the best scenario, I would have seen his emotionless, cold dead face lying on the ground in front of me. But, I died too early. We were getting closer and closer, we had sources of information, and a spy digging for us. Then, everything went wrong, the spy was caught and brutally murdered, we were losing positions, and the whole plan failed. In the last operation, I was killed in a perfect ambush, betrayed by my own. No, it wasn’t Phantom, I don’t know if he is even alive. 

Now, I’m just a ghost or spirit with no senses, but only consciousness and an idea to avenge all those unrighteous deaths. The Dark society, leaded by the Father, was stealing the souls of innocent victims to prolong their own lives and gain supernatural powers. This was the cause of my sister’s death as well as Phantom’s brother death and thousands more lost souls. Someone had to put an end to all of this. Phantom and I were near the core of this wicked organisation, but we needed a little bit more time, maybe a month… or two… I hope he is alive. I have to find Phantom. I have to find a body.

Well I suppose I must have gotten cancer before that because they caught it in one of the later stages. I imagine there's not much like seeing a patient's face when you have to tell them that they require further testing. But there's not much like having bits of your body ripped and cut out and having poison fed through your veins, either. 

A month later my entire reproductive system was gone. I remember lying in my hospital bed with my fiancé holding my hand and telling me that it was alright.

""There are so many ways to have children,"" he told me. It didn't matter. Hot tears still rolled down my face and made a small pile on the pillow beneath me. I turned away from Andrew and curled up on myself. 

You know those dreams you get sometimes? People have dreams. People dream of weddings or hiking mountains or writing novels. As far back as I could remember my only dream was to have a baby. My only dream was to hold something in my arms and call it mine. 

I ""lost the fight,"" as they say, when I was twenty-three. No bright light. No voice. Just pain and drowsiness and too much weakness to even sit up straight. 

""Welcome to Hell"" a voice said to me. I opened my eyes. There was a man pulling me to my feet and leading me somewhere. We walked and a house materialized.

""Miss Brown,"" the man nodded at me. There was some smug smile on his face and he walked away. I wasn't Miss Brown - at least, I'm pretty sure - but as I opened my mouth a voice yelled, *Mum!* and a small pair of arms wrapped around my legs.

I picked her up. She was three, maybe four. She had blonde hair that stuck to her pink cheeks and big blue eyes that met mine in the happiest smile. 

And then I cried again. For the first time out of happiness. Because the man had misspoken. 

This was Heaven, not Hell.

[WP] A new law is passed stating that anyone over the age of ninety can confess to any crime during their life with no legal repercussions. You are entrusted to write your Great Grandmothers dictation of her life.,Ribbonz3,"By the time she reached ninety my grandmother was old and frail and could barely do anything but stay in bed. I was twenty-two - just out of university with bright eyes and two useless degrees in philosophy and theoretical mathematics to my name. Instead of getting an internship or applying to jobs or doing anything remarkably interesting that first summer, though, I was entrusted by my family to one simple task.

To listen to my grandmother's confessions. 

So there I sat, all summer long taking notes while my grandmother gave me her crimes. Sometimes scaring me and sometimes frightening me and sometimes shocking me. 

As it turned out, my grandmother had been abandoned in Russia at age four. She didn't remember her real parents, nor did she remember anything before growing up in Canada at age six. It was around that time that her ""parents"" - who I knew as my great grandparents - began to secretly teach her Russian and feed her lies against the United States.

At age sixteen she was fit for combat. At age eighteen she was wed to another soviet spy. They never spoke Russian together, they were careful not to discuss business in public together. They had three children and went to church on Sunday and then went home and stole state secrets. 

I never met my grandfather. According to my grandmother he was loyal until the end. But my grandmother wasn't so much. It was when her oldest son Alex was eight that she began to pull from the soviets. They wanted to train Alex to become something he wasn't - but my grandmother wanted Alex to forge his own life. She wanted that for all of her children. She wanted them to have freedom - maybe it was the United States Doctrine seeping into her after all those years - not to be destined and predetermined before they were even born.

Her husband - my grandfather - was strictly against this. So in the dead of night my grandmother drugged him and hung him up on his shoes and staged a suicide. In the morning she left a note explaining that she was leaving him and ushered the children out to the car. She moved them from Chicago to Albuquerque, New Mexico. 

And her children grew up blissfully unaware of their parents' pasts or political affiliations. 

I learned a lot about my grandmother that summer. I learned a lot about myself. About philosophy and about what it meant to be not only a mother but a family member and a patriot. I also learned a lot of things I didn't want to know. Things that involved sex out of wedlock and prostitution and murder-by-poison and how my grandmother murdered my grandfather and made it look like a suicide. I probably never needed to know those things. 

And as I walked between my parents and my uncles and my aunts and my cousins and everyone else on the way to city hall with the amended version of my grandmother's confessions, I figured that they didn't need to know all that stuff, either.

So she went to her grave and I kept those secrets for her until now.

Now he watched from the woods as hands poked out behind the trees and motioned to him and voiced called out to him. ""Come play, Nick. Come play.""

He'd been hesitant to do anything. He'd been hesitant that because other people could see them now - or so they'd told Nick - the spirits would start to hurt people. They had always told him that they were forces of good, but they left a feeling of unease lingering in Nick's stomach long after he had hung up his coat for the evening.

His mother, very religious, always used to warn him about demons in the forest. She'd say, *Don't go in too deep, Nicholas. Don't go in too deep or the demons will snatch you and fill your head with lies.* Nick had always respected his mother, but as a young child he'd thought nothing more interesting than the secrets of the forest. 

He'd never had many friends. He hadn't been allowed to have friends that would one day go to Hell. But in the forest voices called to him. They called out his name and when he wandered they introduced themselves as angels. They shook his hand and sat on his shoulder and whispered the words of God into his ear.

But their messages lately had become darker - and the darker they became, the more Nick noticed that other people seemed to be catching on. They would follow him to the edge of the wood by his house. When he reached the edge an odd hunter would usually be there. When he saw Nick talking to the strange creature on his shoulder the hunter would twist their head and look at Nick, and Nick could hear the whispers. 

He heard the whispers from the forest from his friends. He blinked his eyes and stood at his windows and watched them. They called to him.

They wanted something from him.

He had to give it to them.

[OT] A Guide to Writing Perfect Characters,JeniusGuy,"This is a great guide! Can I hop on with something else to say about agency?

Two dimensional characters.

You mentioned this in your post, but for me it's always useful to think of the backgrounds of characters and how they relate. This sort of flows into my dialogue prompt but also flows into sort of shading or fleshing out characters that is so hard to do. Not everyone can be orphaned as a baby or have some sort of vendetta. They can just be bored in their own lives, or searching for happiness.

And not only that, that characters don't only do good or evil things. You touch on this in the 'POV matters' and that's totally true. But someone who's good doesn't do all good things. You and I have both done things we regret. Those things stick with us. 

So the biggest piece of advice that I can give (sorry to jump on here) is to make sure that your (at least human characters) have human characteristics. Not just Mary-Sue type things in that they're good at everything, but also that they've had their ups and downs. Everyone weathers storms. Everyone gets in fights. Everyone doesn't look where they're going and rams their knee into a desk (at least once...maybe). 

Excellent guide. I love reading everything that everyone's written and can't wait to see what other users come up with. ",232C

[WP] A man goes back in time to 1940's Germany to save the Toothbrush mustache.,DoctorSoda,"Thomas J. Abram pressed the button at his desk and shook his restless legs in an attempt to energize them. The air around him hummed and evaporated. He reappeared on cobblestone outside a small tailor's shop. A man walked by and then another. Finally Thomas reached out and yelled, ""Herr Hitler!"" 

The man in a plain shirt and plain pants turned with the wary sort of gaze that was only worn by mothers with more than three children under the age of 6 and men who had recently been released from prison. Hitler's eyes barely took in Thomas or his anachronism of an outfit, or the fact that his German sounded as though it had been learnt using nothing but stereotypes and words from food menus. 

He said something that Thomas interpreted roughly as, ""How do you know my name, strange noodles?""

""Ah. Difficult for my to explain. You are very good! America knows you."" 

""What?""

Thomas shook his head. He took Hitler's hand and pressed his own over it. He gave up completely and switched to English.

""Listen. You will one day become one of the most hated people on the planet. You don't know it now, but everyone except the Thais - who for some reason will never study World War II in schools^* and will still use your quotes un-ironically - will know your name and hate you for it. And before you do that - before you kill 11 million people because you're a little pissy that you don't get to play eight-year-old child and paint pictures for a living - *please* do one thing for me. I have spent my entire life and my entire fortune saving up for this so *please*. *Please* shave off your mustache."" 

""Mustache?"" Hitler stroked his mustache as he thought. His thumb and index finger picked something from the side of his mouth. ""Your German is bad. I think I understand. For the kinder? Yes. But what is this. America will know me? People will know me? 11 million people?""

""I really just care about the mustache."" 

&amp;nbsp;

Thomas J. Abram sat in the sun with his eyes closed, his finger coming up to brush against his beautiful toothbrush mustache. One of the hottest styles ever since the hated Adolf Hitler had declared it disgusting and shaved it off in 1924.

""*Oui*, yeah. We found out it was...it was maybe the early part of of 1956. I think that the people had been hiding the state of the earth - the shape, I mean. *Alors* NASA was created, you know? To help to deter people from finding what was really out there."" 

""What was really out there?"" Charlie watches Simone pick a stray piece of thread from her suit, pulling it out and then twisting her finger around it before snapping it away. ""What was really out there?""

""I'm sure you'll see soon,"" Simone said. She wanders off to a different part of the hangar to speak to someone. Charlie looks out at the plane - not a spacecraft by any means - but a simple plane that has been painted the colors of a night sky. Charlie has heard that it ran on silent engines, too. He could explain it, but the physics alone would probably bore the common man to death. 

In short it's a stealth plane of some sort. Though Charlie wonders why NASA needs a stealth plane.

""Charlie Law?"" a voice calls. Charlie looks up to see a burly guy wearing sunglasses despite the current time. He comes right up to Charlie and sticks his hand in Charlie's face. Charlie shakes it and stands up - still about 3inches short of this guy with his shoulders rolled back and standing at his already intimidating 6'3"". 

""Nice,"" the man smiles. There's a toothpick in his mouth. Charlie thinks that it's a terrible cliché. ""I'm Captain Joshua Miles. You can call me Josh. We're just about ready to board and get outta dodge, if you hear me."" 

""Sure,"" says Charlie. Charlie is soft spoken and still unsure why NASA needs a stealth plane or where they're taking him. All he knows is that he was right - the world *is* flat. But there must be something out there. 

Twenty minutes later Josh yells, ""Pile in!"" and Charlie, Simone, and another woman that Charlie hasn't been introduced to climb the steps to the plane. They take seats, buckling their straps. Simone goes to the cockpit. Josh comes in several minutes later and closes the door behind him.

""Alright then. Here's how it's gonna go. Charlie, you're just watchin' today so you just hang on tight to that seat right there and you'll be right as rain. Simone is up me flying so she can learn the controls of deep-gravity pull-back--Yes, Charlie?""

""Deep gravity pull back?""

""Don't worry, you'll see what I mean in a little while. Mel, this is Charlie. Charlie, Mel. Charlie, Mel is from one of those *tough* towns out in the midwest so I don't think I'd try to cross her. Her rank supersedes yours so in the unfortunate event that I am no willing to act as Captain, Simone is our second and Mel would be our third in command.""

""What if I'm the last one left?""

Josh laughs. ""Well buddy I don't bullshit and let me tell you: if you're the last one left on this first mission you'd better put your head between your legs and hope you go quietly. Alright, everybody. Let's get in the air and out to this thing."" 

Charlie fidgets with his straps as he stares out the window. There's only night outside the window. When he turns to look at Mel she's reading a book. Charlie clears his throat.

""So where are you from?"" he asks.

""Harlem, now be quiet."" She shushes him without even lifting her eyes from the book. ""They can hear us.""

*They?*

The flight takes hours. They had lifted off from a hangar in Dallas and now they had to be somewhere along the pacific ocean. Charlie knows the edge is coming. He looks out over the water and sees a million little lights blinking and flashing. The PA system spits out, ""Alright, we're approaching fence now. Everyone hold on tight."" 

The plane comes to a silent stop and begins to sink its way down to the level of the fence. Charlie can make out tall posts with small discs atop them, blinking in a way that seems too much like a pattern.

""Memory,"" Mel says without looking up. ""Watch the lights too long and you'll forget why you came out here, turn around and go home. We're 100miles from the edge now."" 

There's a click and the fence powers down. Charlie wants to hear the whirr of the engines as they pick up again - but they do no such thing. There is silence as the plane glides up and over the fence and continues on its way. Charlie cranes his neck to try and see the lights behind them but can't. 

""Alright team, here we go. Distractions away, cabin lights off. We're approaching the meridian now."" Charlie looks down. Below him there seems to be black and nothing but black. His head spins as he wonders if he's still on earth at all.

He looks toward Mel but she is holding a finger to her lips. She's barely visible in the cabin. She undoes her seatbelt and comes over to Charlie, leaning over him as she undoes his as well. She takes his hand, finger of her other still to her lips as she leads him to the cockpit. 

Charlie is glad for the hand over his mouth, because he gasps as the front of the plane gives way to glass. They give him a moment to digest it and then remove the hand from his mouth.

In front of them spans a massive cloud, swirling and pulsing. Charlie tries to look into it but there is nothing. Charlie tries to look around it, but there is nothing. Somewhere off to the side he can make out what he thinks are stars. The cloud seems to slosh one way and then another - its movement strangely pendulumic. Charlie watches as Simone makes some gesture with her hand toward Josh and he responds. 

Charlie watches as the black cloud moves, standing on hind legs. His heart goes numb. The creature opens an eye - as big as a planet and somewhat reminiscent of jupiter or saturn with its yellow slit of a pupil.

It watches them. Mel grabs at Charlie's arm and squeezes in what he takes as a sign to not breath. He doesn't.

A minute passes.

Two minutes.

Charlie breathes as slowly as he can through his nose. They are frozen. His muscles ache.

The beast closes its eyes and goes back to its sleeping. Its side swirls. Charlie can feel a suck on the ship, a slow movement. There's a beat and then Josh says, ""We're too close, gotta go.""

""Setting up for the deep gravity pull back Commander,"" Simone is sitting back in her chair. ""Execution in *cinq,* *quatre*, *trois,*--"" 

Mel pulls Charlie back and shoves him into his chair. He fastens his belt just as the ship jerks forward and pulls back. Charlie panics, watching the beast fall closer and closer. Mel seems unconcerned. Charlie feels the thing in his chest and his stomach and his skull, sucked in and destroyed by whatever black hole lives on the creature's side.

Then there is a push. An incredible push, so that he and Mel both jerk forward against the seatbelts and Charlie thinks his ribs might be bruised. There's a yell from the cabin up ahead, and Charlie pushes and twists to try and get away.

A tense thirty seconds of slow moving. So slowly. There is a noise behind them that Charlie hopes he never hears again.

Then the plane begins to move more and more quickly, and then escape.

""What *was* that?"" Charlie yells as soon as he sees the fence pass below them again. Mel shoots him a glance and goes back to reading her book.

""Now Charlie, gotta ask you not to make too much noise back there. We've still gotta concentrate and it won't be any good if we're picked up on the radars. Let's wait til we get back to homebase and then I can try to explain everything. For now let me just say that most of the earth's oceans are 95% unexplored. No one knows what's down there. Now imagine space as you think about it. That creature we just saw is one of a handful we've identified that seems to *guard* or *protect* our planet from something. But don't take 'em for not dangerous. As far as space goes? Well we've explored a big fat nil of it. 100% unexplored, buddy. And this team is gonna be the first. But you've got to keep your mouth shut now, until we get back to home base? You understand?""

He understands.

The ship barely makes a noise as it lands back in the hangar. From next to him Mel undoes her restraints and stands up. She brushes her hair over a shoulder and walks past Charlie without a single look back. Charlie swears he hears her mutter something under her breath about *bringing newbies on the job*. 

Simone comes around and helps him out of the belt that seems to have jammed in their getaway. ""Exciting, *non*?"" She presses hard and the belt clicks open, freeing Charlie and allowing him to stand up. He holds a hand to his neck and feels his pulse race. ""What did you think of it?"" 

""What *was* that?"" Charlie asks. He's looking at Simone and Josh now. Josh gives him a little eyebrow lift and puts a match or a toothpick or something in his mouth.

""What was that? That was your co-commander doing a damn fine piece of work getting us out of a sticky situation. You'd best thank her for saving your ass, rookie."" He walks out of the plane followed by Simone, who gives Charlie a little cheek puff a she hops off. 

Charlie follows them, blinking as he watches the other three strip out of their flight suits and hang them up. ""Someone tell me what's going on.""

""What's going *on*?"" Mel turns around and comes back at Charlie. He almost winces from the way that she puts a hand on his shoulder and starts to shake him. ""If you just stopped asking questions for *three fucking seconds* you might stop endangering us.""

""Endangering you? How did I--""

""What if you had made a fucking sound? What if you had killed us all?""

""Are you kidding, I didn't make a single *peep* out there. It was Josh and Simone talking the whole time and I'm guessing that was *authorized* if he's the goddamn control--""

""Both of you two quiet down right now,"" Josh says. He's standing with his weight on one hip but then he straightens. As tall as he seems to Charlie, he must tower over Simone and Mel. Mel shoots him a look.

""Listen here. I know you're the commander and I respect that. But it took me three years to be let in on this mission. This kid shows up--""

""That kid is older than you are, and twice as versed in the physics of the fake world,"" Josh warns. ""Now I'm going to tell you again. You two play nice or I'll write you both up.""

""Write me up?"" Charlie interrupts. ""Why would you write--""

Simone shakes her head and quiets Charlie. ""To be true, it is best just to not say things now,"" she says. ""Later we'll explain. But here it is not secure. You know? We start talking about it here and everyone hears like the civilians, the news, the bugs that people put around."" She's counting them off on her fingers, her voice nasal and breathy and tripping over certain sounds. 

""Simone here is right. What you're talking about - what you both are talking about - is top secret by can't be discussed out in the open like this. Now we're all going to take a few minutes to sit with ourselves and get some waters and take a piss and whatever we need to do. Then we're going to go brief. This is the team, new and old. Anyone here got a problem with that, because I have a *long* line out the door of people who would gladly fill your shoes."" 

Mel says nothing but pushes past them, her shoulder hitting Charlie's as she goes in what he can only interpret as a sort of message. 

""Mel'll warm up to you,"" Josh shrugs as he watches the woman walking on the other side of the hangar. ""She was quite fond of the last person we had on the team but...well, I'm guessing you know that you weren't brought on 'same time as the rest of us so I'll let you draw your own conclusions there."" 

Charlie watches after them as the other two make their way to the other end of the hangar. He looks back at the dark ship and thinks about what he saw when they were flying. He has so many questions, and no answers.

---

They're sitting around a table. The four of them and a monitor hooked up to the wall that shows the face of a rather serious-looking military man. 

""So you see we think it's just about time we went on this mission,"" Josh is saying. No one is speaking but Josh. Charlie isn't sure that anyone is allowed to speak besides Josh and the military man. The man, who introduced himself only as L, has a scar running vertically along his face from his eyebrow to the outer corner of his lip. Charlie watches the way it dances as L speaks.

The two are swapping a lot of technical information. They're talking about what sort of vehicle is required and fuel and something about the ""new"" NASA. Simone is looking down at her splayed fingers on the wooden table. Mel is twisting the hair by her ear into a braid and then undoing it only do tie it up again. Charlie sits with his hands on his knees, his back aching and his head heavy with questions that no one seems in any particular hurry to answer or illuminate.  

""Snopes,"" the man named L says. Charlie blinks, his eyes coming to meet the military man. Josh frowns.

""You frozen in your seat? You stand up when the director talks to you."" 

Charlie stands and faces the man. The scar on the director's face twitches with his words. L speaks to Charlie for a small bit of time about the government and world safety and conspiracy theories.

""I just hope you're better than the last one,"" he spits. Then he's gone. Charlie is standing in front of an empty monitor.

""Sit your butt back down."" Josh presses his chin up to acknowledge Charlie. There's a twinge of annoyance in his face that Carlie couldn't remember seeing earlier. As Charlie sits Josh stands up and puts his arms behind his back. ""Alright. Enough of the smoke and mirrors act. Let's tell our new member what he's in for with the *space program*,"" Josh uses air quotes around the last two words.

Mel rolls her eyes. ""Why even tell him? He's just going to die, anyway. Everyone in his position always dies.""

Charlie blinks. ""I'm sorry. *Everyone* in my position dies? What exactly is my position?""

The three look at each other. Simone opens her mouth and then closes it. ""You are the communicator, Charlie. It's up to you to talk to the bordering guards to let us out or...maybe to let us trick our way out?""

""Trick your way...?""

""Simone is a bit nervous. Let me paraphrase. We've got four of us. I'm the commander. Simone here is the co-commander and is also our mechanic. Miss Mel back there is responsible for communication to home base and trip preparation, as well as logistics surrounding food. That leaves you. You're responsible for communication with *them*.""

""*Them?*""

""I know, I know. I'll get to it, I promise. Now just you sit and listen, alright? About the year before NASA became a government program was when all the conspiracy theories about the world being flat and the UN hiding something were starting to come out. Now NASA was created to try and deter these rumors by saying we were exploring space. We were going to the moon and we were sending machines out to take pictures - all that. Well all that was staged, as you might expect. You got pretty darn close to the truth there. But I'm afraid the truth is an odd one indeed. You see, a couple odd decades ago we did notice that the world was flat. What we didn't notice were the fences. You see, anytime anyone gets close to one of those fences that we flew over, their memory just vanishes. *Poof!* Like some sort of weird fairy trick. They turn around whatever they're doing - flying or sailing or whatever have you. They just turn right on around and come right on back and forget. 

""Now the governments of the world've been covering for this for quite some time. Commercial airline maps, flight patterns. Pilots know, of course. What you see out an airplane? Mostly staged. Government figured out some time ago how to put screens on the windows, make it seem like the earth was round. I know you're thinking about hot air balloons or something of that sort - there are other fail safes for those too. It's a strange world that we live in.

""You see, Charlie. We're pretty sure it's not just a strange world we live in. We're pretty sure, up here in the big leagues, that it's a staged world. That someone created the flat world and put us here and they're watching us. Our job is to find them. Our job is to get past the Keepers - we call em Beasties for fun but I think their official name is Gate Keepers, since they live past the fences. You're the one's going to communicate with them. You're the one who's going to get us past them.""

Charlie's face flushes as Josh finishes his speech. Mel is watching him through narrowed eyes. Simone is playing with her fingers. 

""Other people have done this job before?""

""Sure have,"" Josh watches him closely.

""And they died?""

""They did.""

""Can I turn this down? Now that I know?""

""Well that's a complicated question, Charlie. You see you can - no one here's going to force you to do anything. We chose you because of your knowledge of physics in the 'perceived world' as we call it. As well as your language skills and your intellect. That's why we chose you. If you don't want to be our speaker we can find someone else. But I hope you do. Because if you don't want the job it might...well, let's just say you aren't in Kansas anymore. Can't go home again, that's the saying, right? Doesn't seem like home.""

A chill goes down Charlie's spine. The two women are avoiding his gaze.

""If I don't agree, I can't just go home. I'm either in or out.""

""In or out, Charlie,"" a smile is playing on Josh's lips. ""You're either in or out.""

Charlie takes a moment and mulls it over. *What other choice do I have?*

""I'm in.""

A smile breaks over Josh's face. ""Well then ladies, looks like we have ourselves a new speaker.""

[WP]in hell instead of torture you are forced to relive every thing you shirked off that you didn't want to do.,Crypticlibrarian,"""Enough,"" the voice booms from overhead. Greg falls to his knees and brings his balled fists to his forehead. 

*Enough,* Greg thinks, but the voice above has hardly begun.

""So now let's see where we are, Greg. We've relived breaking up with a few girlfriends. Relived telling Sally that you had an STD - you know that killed her, right? Tsk tsk. I think we're almost done with the romance part. There's just one left, Greg. Just one, then we'll move on to a different part of your responsibilities."" 

""How are these my responsibilities?"" Greg yells to the sky. His head hurts, his muscles hurt. He's cried more times than he thought he could, been forced into uncomfortable breakup after breakup. He's watched every girl he never called back - those that shrugged it off and those that he had tricked into thinking he wanted more. 

He closes his eyes. A sleep pulls at him and he can't quite get there. A laugh overhead informs him he never will.

""Greg?"" a voice comes from somewhere to his left. He opens his eyes. A girl - a plain girl, a not-that-attractive girl. Greg doesn't remember her. She's young. *Really* young, like this must be a memory or responsibility from high school or before. She has mousy bits of brown hair that stick to her face. She's looking somewhere in the distance as she says, ""Greg?""

""Greg?"" her nostrils flare. She pushes her lips back, her eyes opening the slightest bit as they start to water. She reaches up and scratches her nose, squeezes her eyes shut and then opens them again with some shuddering breath. Greg thinks she might be on a cellphone, or maybe even a home phone. Maybe young Greg is just right there, watching and pretending not to hear.

""Greg, I'm sorry if I was too clingy. You're-you're the only guy that's ever been kind of nice to me. And we kissed and I was so happy and I thought *wow, this guy is so decent and I like kissing him* and I was happy because I was hoping that I'd get to kiss you lots and lots and lots. And that we could hold hands. I know people don't like me. I know a lot of people think I'm weird and a freak and they won't talk to me. But I thought you thought I was pretty cool. If-if you're too embarrassed to be seen with me maybe we could just hang out at my house. We could walk to this field with some wildflowers. Or we could get ice cream. Greg? Greg, please don't ignore me. Please don't shut me out. Not you, too. Please. I feel so alone and you showed me so much kindness.""

""Greg?""

""Please, Greg.""

""Please.""

""Caskets. Caskets for sale,"" I'd drone. I'd walk right up to the door of the offender and knock loudly and knock wholly. ""Caskets for sale. Buy your casket. Now just a hundred dollars. Buy now, tomorrow it's going up.""

I knew they would buy, because they knew that when I came around it meant something bad. They knew that for the last two months everyone I'd been selling caskets to (or tying to sell caskets to) died within the week. After they were dead my prices mysteriously went up. 

So they bought their caskets. They bought them for a hundred instead of a thousand so that they had something to put their loved one in. I went home with a pocket full of bills and a smile on my face.

It just so happens that it happened thirty four years ago and thirty four years before that.""

""Shut up and listen to the story, Jenna."" 

""I'm just saying that--""

""Do you want me to tell you a story or not? Come on.""

""Fine,"" Jenna said. ""Go ahead and tell me the story.""

Charlie cleared his throat.

""The year is 2049. In the top tower of a building that has been cut off from the world for thirty-four years a man stands behind a tall window with his hands clasped behind his back. He looks out over the industrial city - changed so much since his childhood all those years ago. The fumes from the factory have made his head go light, and as he looks out the window he becomes dizzy. He grabs onto a chair to steady himself, thinking that it's about time to find someone else to take over the factory.

""So he calls an oompa loompa. Yellow skin and bright orange hair and all, it comes to him and says, 'Yes, Charlie?'--""

""Wait,"" Jenna interrupted. ""Charlie is the name of the guy who owns the factory? Isn't that Willy Wonka?""

""No,"" Charlie rolled his eyes. ""Willy Wonka was the *first* guy. He gave the factory to charlie.""

""But then you said it happened every thirty-four years. That would have been the first thirty-four years. The second thirty-four years *Charlie* would have found someone to inherit--""

""--fine, the guy who inherited it was called Charlie, too.""

""So there were *two* Charlies? I don't know, what are the odds of *two* Charlies not only getting a golden ticket but *also* making it all the way through the challenges and--""

""Jenna if you don't shut up I'm going to go play Call of Duty and I will never tell you another story as long as we live."" 

""Well that might not--""

""Jenna.""

""Fine."" 

Charlie took a deep breath and continued. Jenna let her eyes shut as she listened. 

""So the second Charlie - the one who had inherited the factory from the first Charlie - looked out over the city that had changed so much over thirty-four years--""

""You changed tenses,"" Jenna said.

""God *dammit*, Jenna. Fine. '*So the second Charlie the one who had inherited the factory from the first Charlie* ***looks*** *out over the city that has changed so much over the thirty-four years...*'""

""Go on,"" said Jenna. Charlie sighed.

""He looks out over the city and he thinks that it's time for the factory to get a new owner. He's moving up in age and the fumes have made him dizzy, like I said. He calls the oompa loompa...shit, I already said that too. Okay, he puts the tickets in chocolate bars and sends them out all over the city and announces the contest. There are five bars of chocolate with golden tickets, and the five children who find them will have the dazzling chance to come explore Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory.

""Even though people still remember the last time it happened, they still buy up all the chocolate. Kids of all ages - from age 1 to age 17-and-three-quarters, all of them are spending their allowances on chocolate or begging their parents or drooling over their bottles for the stuff. People fill their cars--""

""People have *cars* in 2049? They don't have like, hovercrafts? Or bicycles?""

""*Jenna*,"" Charlie said. He stood up and threw his hands into the air. ""I don't know why I even try. You don't even want to hear a story. I'm going home.""

""Charlie no, *wait*,"" she said. There was a knock on the door and a woman in blue scrubs walked in. Jenna caught Charlie's eye and made a face. ""Please don't go.""

Charlie sighed as the woman took down a few notes and exited again. Jenna reached out with the hand not connected to an IV. 

""Of all the little sisters in the world I had to get the one who's annoying *and* sick,"" he sat down again. ""I swear to God, if you interrupt me one more time."" 

""I'll listen,"" Jenna said. Charlie put his hand on hers and she smiled at him. ""Just don't leave."" 

Charlie had to keep himself from smiling. ""So the year is 2049. Picture the top of a tower in a building that's been cut off from the world for thirty-four years. A man is standing...""

"[CW] When you introduce a new character, you must switch to their perspective. A previous character can't ever be the viewpoint character again.",CyberPunkButNotAPunk,"I think this is the worst date ever. My hands are sweating and I'm trying to wipe them on my slacks but I'm also kind of afraid that if I try to do this they'll leave those handprints as proof of sweaty palms. And *Jesus Christ* no one likes sweaty palms. So I just clear my throat and take another sip of water and I look over at Juliet who--

He's staring at me. He seems really nice. Really nice. But I think he hasn't been on a date in a while. It's one of those things where his face is flushed like mine gets after a few glasses of wine. His words are stumbling over each other and it's endearing, I guess. It makes me feel kind of cute and kind of pretty and attractive, that he's so nervous to be with me. And I reach across the table and I try to take his hand and tell him it will be okay, but his hands are under the table and then I pull my hand back because the waiter is coming, this big burly guy who--

*I get off in two hours.* The mantra that keeps me going. These two are staring at each other and not making much conversation. I don't care. 

""Hey, can I get you anything else?"" I ask the girl. She smiles at me and looks over to her date. Her date looks like he's drowning on land or something. Poor bastard. I make a note to send them a free dessert to share and then give them my best smile as I pick up their plates. I know what it's like to be in that situation. It was like that when I was still alone. I leave the couple behind - God, they're not even *talking* - and walk back into the kitchen to buss the tables. The manager shoots me a look that makes me feel like--

""Adam *why* is table four still waiting on their drinks?"" Oh, Saturday night. I hate Saturday night. I wish I could take Saturday night into a corner and beat it into submission and then take its lunch money. Great for business, sure. The restaurant has a waiting list of fifteen people but all that means is that I'm trying to get people like Adam to just get in the groove of things and get people *out* so we can get new people *in*. He's an old timer, he should get things like this.

""I'm on it, I'm on it,"" he waves his hand in this way that makes me wonder if he's come to work high again, but I'm not about to ask because even though he shows up two hours later almost every night he's been here since the restaurant opened. I'd think that this would make him a better server, but no. I guess not. 

""Oh, by the way Marie,"" Adam turns back around a corner to look at me. ""Send table five a creme brulee or something? Looks like a first date and he needs a little more time to *come into himself*."" 

I pause as Adam walks into the back room. I must admit, even if he does show up late and is high most of the time, he has a good read on people. I punch it into the computer and then grab one of the other servers who--

Oh my god I have four tables of my own and fucking *Marie* wants me to just get a creme brulee ready and put two spoons on it and take it out to table-fucking-five and she won't even tell me why, and that's *Adam's* table I tell her but she just looks at me with that fucking look that says I'm-the-manager-and-you-aren't and I want to fucking scream and I know I'm going to go home and just take a sleeping pill and zonk out because I need to be here *again* tomorrow at six-fucking-am to open the goddamn restaurant but *no*, instead of letting me get some fucking tips of my own by working my tables I have to take this goddamn creme brulee out to some table that isn't even mine and--

""Here you go!"" The biggest smile I can manage as I set it on the table. The duo look up at me. ""It's compliments of the house. Is there anything else I can get you?""

""Um...maybe a glass of white wine?"" the woman says. She looks sweet, and through my plastered on smile I want to scream. Of *course* she wants a goddamn white wine, because everyone wants something and no one thinks of anything, and *I* won't be getting tips at this table but I still have to fucking serve them because the 'customer is always right' and that nonsense so I smile and I say:

""Of course. I'll be right back with that,"" and I give her this warm little gesture of putting my hand on her shoulder like *all* I care about is making sure she has the best dining experience she can while I glance over at my four tables and notice that someone doesn't fucking have water and so while I'm getting this woman a glass of white wine all I can think about is my tables my table my tables. So I head back into the kitchen and I scream,

""Adam! Table five wants a glass of white wine and I'm not getting it!"" And Marie looks at me like I've set something on fire and she holds a finger to her lips but honestly I'm so over it, and I grab two new glasses of water and walk back out to *my* tables who will be providing *my* money for the night and put them down and ask the nice gentleman if he'd like--

""...anything else?"" She seems sweet enough. Tired. There are circles under her eyes. 

I look toward my wife, who--

Smiling, I shake my head. ""Just the check please. Thank you, it really has been a marvelous dinner.""

""I'm so happy to hear that,"" the waitress says. She really does seem quite sincere about the sentiment as she disappears and puts the black bill down on the table and says, ""you can just pay upfront anytime you like. Thank you again for coming and it was a pleasure serving you."" 

Across the check is written *Thank you!* with a little heart at the end, and I think it makes Ronald chuckle but I think it's sweet, I really do. We sit for a while and talk, because he's holding my hand and I'm leaning my head against his shoulder. Even after all this time it feels wonderful to be close to my husband. And then eventually we slide out of the booth and take the check and walk it down to the hostess stand, and the hostess--

""Alright, your total comes to $81.73,"" I say. I forgot to mention the tip.Oh well. I give them my best smile and take their credit card and run it and they do leave a tip (oh thank god). Then they thank me and I thank them. Another couple is coming in waiting to be seated, but a different couple is coming to pay so I take them first, giving the two waiting this little smile and saying, ""I'll be with you in just a moment."" 

He looks...wet. I didn't know that people could look wet after sitting in an air conditioned restaurant. He's really sweaty. And I'm trying hard not to listen to their conversation. I'm a curious person. I'm sorry.

I give them the bill to sign and am a little more hesitant to greet the new couple because I really want to finish eavesdropping. The guy doesn't seem to be saying anything, just wiping his hands on his slacks, but then the woman says, ""So how about next Saturday night, too?""

I have to get the new couple to the table, and the guy isn't facing me. But I figure she just made his night.

He shook his head as he went to go check on another patient. Examining them Oscar thought about what he used to wish for when he was a child. He had wished on everything from pennies to clock numbers for one thing and one thing only.

Oscar had wanted to be a superhero. 

That dream had changed when he was ten years old. That was the year that Tremendous Man stumbled in his fight against Nemthalis. The entire population of Plainsville had watched as Tremendous Man lost the first fight in the history of his existence. 

From there, it had only gotten worse.

&amp;nbsp;

Oscar checked the man's blood pressure and pulse and respiration rate and scribbled down the numbers on a chart. He gave the man a pat on the back and pulled up a rolling stool and sat to ask him questions.

""How are you feeling today?""

The man didn't answer. Instead he shook his head and put his body back down on the bed, turning onto his side and curling up into a ball. From his position on the stool Oscar could see soles of his feet - now scaled and blue. Oscar knew they were making their way up the man's body. That soon he would be covered head to toe. But it was too early to know if it would kill him.

&amp;nbsp;

Tremendous Man got sick. Oscar had tapped on his mother's leg and pointed to the television and said something along the lines of, ""Mom, they got it wrong, right?"" 

Oscar's mother hadn't answered. The news hadn't gotten it wrong. Tremendous Man deteriorated. He became erratic. Plainsville grew to fear him more than Nemthalis for the simple reason that he was completely unpredictable. The day that Tremendous Man died Oscar had been watching the television. It was the super hero's final battle. He had put all of his weight into a mid-air punch. He flew forward and Nemthalis ducked. Tremendous Man flew straight into a building, shattering it from the top down. 

They never found his body, and Oscar stopped wishing on stars.

&amp;nbsp;


""How is he?"" a nurse asked Oscar in a hushed tone as he left the patient's room. Oscar shook his head.

""Give him 5 of morphine. He might need more. Sometimes the changes alter their realities and their physiology. All his vitals indicate he's still in a lot of pain - though he's still nonverbal."" 

The nurse shook her head in pity before sliding the glass door back open and stepping into the room. Oscar brought his hands up to his head and rubbed at his temples hoping to get rid of the ache that had begun there. It was spreading to the back of his head now. He blinked several times, his eyesight going blurry and then clearing again. He reached down into his pocket and squeezed his eyes shut as he reached for a pen.

""Doctor,"" another nurse said. ""You're needed in room four.""

Oscar shook his head to clear it and then nodded at the nurse. Realizing he had been squeezing his pen he pulled it out of his pocket. The black ink stained his hand. 

The nurse who had been speaking to him simply stared with her mouth open. Oscar pursed his lips and took a deep breath. 


&amp;nbsp;


He perched on the edge of a building and looked out into Plainsville. It had been six years since the pen incident. Rather than taking to the hospital and seeking treatment Oscar had embraced his new persona. The doctor in the back of his mind supposed it was some subset of denial. Most people used their powers to see the world or rob banks and provide for their families, or swim down to the depths of the ocean with their eyes still open.

Some became villains. Nemthalis was not a superhero, but others with superpowers had gone to join him. They had been taken down in time, though what took them down was equal parts superhero and equal parts chance. 

When Oscar faced him there was no villain with superpowers. It was just Nemthalis - keen and smart but slowed with age. 

Oscar felt the power buzz through him. He felt it tug at his muscles and bulge in his veins. He closed his eyes again. Nemthalis was just a paper cup.

Oscar took a deep breath and lunged at him. The power ripped through his veins. He could feel it tearing him apart as he flew. 

His body burned an arc across the sky.

What price? Why, the price of music. I was to perform every day, and every day I'd rejuvenate. One slip up, and *krrk*.  
  
I see you shaking your head. Think that's easy? So did I. So I became a Bard, and wandered the world.  
  I’ve played for every audience I could think of, with every instrument. When drum rhythms went out of vogue, I fashioned a simple string lute and continued on my way, against all troubles. *I* fiddled when Rome burned, I strummed when Atlantis sank, I hummed when the Huns invaded.  
  
About the Middle Ages, I changed styles. Well, it was out of necessity; I was nearly hanged for luting on the battlefield. The soldiers somehow felt the ditty I was playing was ‘inappropriate’. It’s not my fault *’the lusty barmaid’* was the only one I could think of at the time.  
  
Anyway, I shifted instruments; the Tabor and Fife, the guitar (so much easier than the lute, don’t you think?), bagpipes  And the Accordion. I take pride in reviving the ‘English Flute’.  
*The What?*  
Oh all right; the recorder. Don’t make that face, it’s a wonderful instrument. So easy to play, and I could keep it in my pocket.  
Yes, as the years went on, it became easier and easier to perform. So many instruments, so much *music* in the world. Compared to those early years, when all I had was a stick to hit another stick, this is wonderful.  
And now look; we have these mobile telephone things. I can get a piano stored in here and play every morning, anywhere.  
  
Ah well, I am rambling down memory lane again. It’s a long path for me, eh? Let’s start again, wi...  
*Oh, but...*  
No buts; now pick up your bow. We’ll run through the chords, then on to Mary has a little lamb. Your mother is paying me to teach, not talk, and even immortals have to eat.  
  
And a one, and a two, one, two, three...",POTWP

Junko was a quiet girl, and she was good. Every morning she would make breakfast, clean the dishes, and prepare lunch... all while attending middle school. I was ashamed to have resorted to that, but it was never intentional. Her mother died at childbirth, and so I had to raise Junko alone. I... I never really wanted to be a father. Her mother was the one that was so adamant about having a child. She always told me that a child would make me an even better man. I'm ashamed of myself... I can't even manage to visit her grave.

But every morning, a little part of my soul is reinvigorated by seeing Junko in the kitchen. It was just as it was before she was born, when her mother was around. I thought I could handle being a father... I struggled when she was a baby. The government wouldn't help me, and I had no family. I was alone. I was working two jobs and a nanny practically raised her in her infancy.

But now that Junko's become of age, it's been a little easier on me. I was able to quit my part time job, and now I spend all my free time with her... to make up for the time I lost when she was a baby. In order to build up the courage to visit her mother's grave one day. I would help her with her homework, take her to the park, take her to seasonal festivals, take her to the zoo, and so on. I would do all the things a father would do for their child.

Although, I'm still ashamed of myself. I'm ashamed at having her make the breakfast and lunch, and I'm ashamed of how I raised her as a baby, but I'm most shameful for accepting the deal with that company on that rainy day.

The interviewer's office was snugly hidden in the corner of the waiting room. I opened the door and noticed a faint smell of body odor, but it was overpowered by the scent of a strong cologne that most people would label as *old man's cologne*.

However the interviewer was a sharp looking young man, he was dressed in a pinstripe suit with a red tie to compliment the look. He was sitting in an impressive looking office chair that was at least two feet taller than he was while he was sitting. On the walls inside his office were more poster sized ReNew U ads.

When Junko and I walked into the office, the interviewer was on the phone. He signaled us to sit down in the pair of chairs in front of his desk, by pointing at us and then at the chairs. He quickly ended his conversation, probably to show us he wanted to give us his undivided attention, and that he did. He hung up the phone and laughed aloud.

""Mr. Vitalis! It's great to finally meet you. After receiving your application, I anticipated this moment. Now, before we start, I'd like to reiterate from the instructions you received on our VR website that everything we discuss here today is strictly confidential. You will be required to sign a nondisclosure agreement and henceforth will legally only be able to talk to me about what we discuss.""

The interviewer put two sheets of paper in front of me. They were titled *Nondisclosure Agreement*. He pointed at the line that read *Beta Tester's Signature*, and handed me a pen. I quickly skimmed through the documents as if I knew how to read legalese. I nodded obliviously and signed. I inherently trusted the interviewer, however reckless that may sound to a lawyer. The interviewer grinned with menace, and casually gathered the two sheets of paper. He signed on the line that read, *Interviewer's Signature*, and filed the documents in his desk drawer.

He took out several other documents and arranged two piles; one in front of himself and one in front of Junko and I. The cover page was titled *ReNew U Flagship Product: ReJoov U, Phase One*. I cringed after reading that title.

I looked at Junko and she was silent as usual. I couldn't decide if she glared at the interviewer or feared him. She still gripped my two fingers intensely - they were numb by the time the interviewer started speaking again - so I thought it could have been either or. But knowing Junko, she probably feared him.

The interviewer spoke the way businessmen spoke in the VR movies, whenever they tried coercing their targets - the voice that contained a faint sound of deceit. But I was a fool back then and couldn't hear it in his voice.

""So... Mr. Vitalis, Junko. I'm glad you made it. As you noticed in the waiting room, we are currently experiencing PR issues. We expected for that room to be full of prospective beta testers."" Despite his words, he grinned. ""But it seems people don't take us seriously."" He tapped the desk with the knuckle on his index finger and his voice turned grave. ""However, do not fear. ReNew U has the full support of the government. We are working closely to ensure every citizen will eventually have access to our flagship product, ReJoov U.""

With the flip of a switch, his voice returned to the business like tone. ""Now then, I think it's about time for my formal explanation of ReJoov U."" The man smiled warmly, with the slightest hint of malice in the corner of his lips.

While we traveled to the rejuvenation company's international headquarters, the rainstorm turned into a thunderstorm. When we arrived, lighting flashed in the rear view mirror, and the delayed sound wave, from the thunder, rocked our car with a vengeance as if to mock our sputtering car. Junko was jolted awake from the rumblings of the car's chassis.

""Father, have we arrived?"" the quiet girl asked softly.

""Yes dear. We're at the ReNew U international headquarters.""

A shiver suddenly crawled up the skin on my back along my spinal cord.

""Junko, we should head inside. We're only thirty minutes early.""

""We want to make a good impression, right, Father?""

I smiled.

""Yes dear, you're right.""

We entered the corporate building and were immediately bombarded with ReNew U advertisements in the form of two banners hanging from the high ceiling on either side of the room. In the middle of the room was a ten foot tall golden statue of an ancient roman woman holding a vase. The statue stood in the middle of a shallow pool as the centerpiece of the indoor fountain; water poured out of the vase and into the pool below.

The reception desk was located right in front of the fountain and was hard to miss, especially because the young lady working the desk aggressively waved at me and my daughter. Junko grabbed at my ring and pinky fingers and held them tightly. Her hand was shaking nervously but her grip kept firm.

""Mr. Vitalis! I'm glad you made it, and you're so early too. Please, make your way up the stairs on either side of the fountain, and take the elevator to the ninth floor. Please follow the signs that say *Phase One* from there. If you have any questions, please direct all of them to your interviewer. Thank you for taking the interest in ReNew U. Together we will slowly change the world!""

The young receptionist smiled intently, eyes closed and continued to do so even as Junko and I walked toward the stairs.

I didn't notice them at first, but there was a grand circular staircase that led up on either side behind the large fountain, and just as the receptionist instructed, we took the elevator to the ninth floor. As soon as we stepped out of the elevator, there were poster sized ReNew U advertisements hanging on the walls beside the elevator. In front of the elevators there was of course the sign that said *Phase One* and it had an arrow that directed us to a chain of four more signs until we finally got to the interviewing waiting room. The room was empty even though it was a large room that looked like it could hold dozens of people. Junko and I took a seat and waited silently for the time to pass by. There were twenty more minutes until the time of the interview.

"[WP] ""Father, what am I?""",Mercury1964,"####Part 2

I had a meeting with the rejuvenation company on a spring day in the early evening. It was an odd day, because I had arranged to pick up Junko from school immediately after work. I rarely did so during those days, because I normally had to get to my second job.

Junko normally stayed after school for activities, or just went straight home. She was finishing her first year of middle school, and she felt strongly about being more independent, so I indulged her and let her go home on her own. In addition it allowed me to stop paying a nanny, which slightly helped our financial situation.

But now that I think about it, Junko has been the one that suggested she take over the house chores. It was her way of contributing to our household. If i recall correctly, I didn't ask her to start cooking breakfast or preparing lunch, she initiated it herself. What a good kid.

It was raining on the day of the meeting, like I said earlier. Junko was in the back seat of my beat up old gas guzzler. I think I was the only one that still used a car that ran on gasoline. It wasn't an impressive looking four wheel drive monster of a truck, but rather a simple sedan, with decent air conditioning and a sunroof. Junko's mother loved the sunroof.

One day, her mother had gotten drunk and stuck her head out of the sunroof while I was driving. It was very out of character for her, and she told me afterward that she always had the urge to do something like that but never dared to. She was a  very light drinker and hardly drank because of it. But when she did, she was one rowdy woman.

Junko was asleep, she was drooling all over the car cushions, but I didn't blame her. She got up at 5 in the morning, earlier than I did, just to have enough time to do all the cooking and get herself ready for school. On top of that she had stayed after school to participate in the track and field meet. Since it was raining they normally do laps in the gymnasium. She was hovering in the top five best kids in her school for the two hundred meter dash. It was a big deal for her, and she loved it.

Her sleeping face reminded me of her mother's. Their brows wrinkled in just the same spots, and she even inherited her mother's dimples. Day by day, Junko was becoming a strong independent woman. Her old man wasn't worthy of having a child like her. Her mother would be proud to call her a daughter, as I am today.

The companies of the rejuvenation industry were fairly young. The oldest of the companies started out as research and development ventures. But after the breakthrough in their shared medical research the governments of the world quickly passed safety laws for the industry to operate. It was a well oiled political push to get the rejuvenation industry operating as soon as possible.

I didn't learn about ReNew U's existence until I heard an ad on the radio on my way to work one day, and what drew me in was the *substantial* monetary gain, as the ad put it.

ReNew U was one of the oldest, if not, the oldest of them all. The lavish lobby convinced me of that. I hadn't done a whole lot of research into the industry but I did browse ReNew U's virtual reality website at the library. It was surprisingly ultra modern looking, in contrast to the extravagant golden statue in their lobby. The site had lots of information however. The artificial avatars were helpful in answering all of my questions.

ReNew U was recruiting citizens to beta test their premier flagship product and interviews can be acquired by signing up on the VR website. The avatar recorded all of my information and processed it. In less than a minute the avatar provided me instructions on when and where my interview would be held.

The instructions included two peculiar points of interest; the first was a request that I bring Junko with me to the interview, and the second was a brief explanation of why.

""Father! A worker said we could go meet the interviewer now... Father!""

Junko stood in front of me and she shook me violently.

""Oh, Junko. Was I asleep?""

""Yes, Father. A worker just came to inform us that it was time to see the interviewer.""

""Haha. I guess we ended being late, huh Junko?""

Junko smirked.

""OK, let's go, Junko. To see the interviewer.""

Junko still held my hand, ever since we saw the receptionist, and with the same grip, although she wasn't shaking as much.

I wondered what was going through her head. We were there at that strange place. She must have thought it was out of the ordinary, and it surely was. We had our daily routine we kept for almost a year. I worked for two jobs at that time, and she was busy with the house chores, homework, and after school activities - mostly track and field. A sudden change in routine could be frightening for an introverted girl like Junko. But I was desperate back then and ReNew U offered me a deal that was irresistible, even for a made man. The break in the daily routine was worth it because that one day would slowly change our lives.

""Father, will you tell me about why we made this trip soon?""

""Oh"" I was startled.

Junko was shy, she rarely spoke in public... But I realized the room was empty.

""Yes dear, I will. But please be patient...""

I didn't have a good explanation for her at the time. I should have told her about why we were there at that moment, while we had privacy and before the interviewer explained everything. It should have been me to explain her fate if she was accepted. But I didn't do any such thing. Instead I kept silent.

""OK Father"" Junko obediently replied.

A moment passed and the tension in the room grew. It felt like the large waiting room was at capacity with people and that they were all staring at me. My cheeks felt hot and I noticed my breathing increased.

Junko finally broke the silence.

""Father, when we get home, would like me to make curry? That's your favorite.""

Her quiet voice pierced the silent room, but her words struck a deep blow that casted away my delirium. 

""N-No dear. That's quite alright. I'll pass by a fast food restaurant on our way home. How about a cheeseburger with fries? A nice greasy burger is one of my mainstay dinner items after all!""

I hoped that was enough to ease her mind, but she didn't laugh, giggle, or even smirk. She just sat there silently.

""Um, you see dear, by the time we get home it will already be time for bed. So instead of cooking today,  we can just eat out.""

She smiled. It worked for the moment. At least she tried take the effort to look comfortable. But her grip on my two fingers were as tight, if not, tighter than before.

""OK Father"" she said.

[OT] Sunday Free Write: Motivational Edition,you-are-lovely,"Naruto, Death Note, AoT, HxH are among my top favorite anime. are you watching the 2011 HxH or the old one? I hear Your Lie in April and Haikyuu are good, but I just haven't gotten into it.

I saw the first [cour](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cour) of the Nura anime, and I was also drawn to the IP as well, based on its premise.

As far as I know about the arabic jinn, they are the incarnation of pure evil. **But** since they are supernatural beings, there is so much potential for what you're doing with the concept of jinn.

Samurai Champloo is an anime that imo is what you're looking for, in terms of it being about two samurai. Plus, I'd recommend it either way. I haven't watched Afro Samurai in a looong time, but I hear that's also a great anime as well.

Berserk is another great IP that may help you with this. I'd suggest you watch the anime first, specifically the movies of The Golden Age Arc, but the manga for it is really good as well. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/watch_order#wiki_berserk) is a great guide in terms of watch order for Berserk. To save time, I just watched the movies, then went on to read the manga from the beginning. Plus there is a new series for it coming out in July of this year.

The Matrix series, along with the Animatrix (there is a good story about two swordsman battling in it), may also be a good series to watch as well? Despite what everyone says about it, I love the Matrix and its universe.

One Piece is a great adventure manga about a boy who wants to find the legendary treasure, the One Piece, and become the Pirate King.

I just started playing the first Uncharted, and I understand why people give it so much praise.

It's funny that you're working on refining your skills in writing action and adventure, because I'm also trying to do that as well. I mean, I'm trying to be a better writer in general, but I completed a novel for [NaNoWriMo](http://nanowrimo.org/) last year, but I'm just not happy with how it turned out at all. I think what it needs is more action which is why I want to get better at it.

I think this sub is great in that there's an endless supply of ideas you can use to help refine your craft.

Maybe you can submit a Prompt Me [PM] post asking people to prompt you for action and adventure prompts? ",cmp150
[OT] Sunday Free Write: Motivational Edition,you-are-lovely,"That was lovely! ;p

So many of your points vibe with what I'm goin through right now.

But I think it's dangerous to recklessly burn yourself out. It happened to me after last year's NaNoWriMo and I've only bounced back in a serious way in the last week or so.

In any case thanks for sharing this. I think this would be a great motivator for if someone's ever feeling down.

If you're interested, I'll be posting the entirety of it on the original prompt as I write it.

However if I may pick your brain, when you say you were wondering about what was going on the whole time, do you mean it confusing as you read it?  
Specifically, I followed my train of thought as I wrote it, so I changed subjects a lot, (the mother getting drunk bit for example), then tried transitioning back into what I was talking about before.

In any case I hope i can wrap it up nicely, and in a satisfying way. I got it all in my head, I just have to get it on the screen! (not on paper, right?)

",cmp150
[OT] Sunday Free Write: Motivational Edition,you-are-lovely,"Thanks for enlightening me and sharing that information. I have a lot of coworkers that all believe in jinn as well, and I think it's really fascinating. I've even heard stories of their family and/or friends encountering jinn firsthand.

&gt; it's a really taboo topic,

You think I may have crossed a line with them, when I asked about the jinn? However, they were willing to share, so I can't imagine they were too offended.

Also I was thinking of shaytan jinn in my previous comment, sorry, I was mistaken.

&gt; Regardless, that's where it comes from, branching Japanese culture and my Arab roots together and having a Samurai part-human, part-jinn, traveler wander around the Arab desert fighting beasts and monsters and finding treasure.

That sounds really interesting, and there's so much potential for so many stories to spawn from that premise.

[WP] A conspiracy theorist and a lizard person fall in love.,moocow1452,"Rexxthar Spiketail opened the door to his mid-century ranch house.  With a heavy sigh, he hung up his coat and hat and slipped out of his leather loafers.  

""Is that you, honey?"" called Carol from the kitchen.  ""Or am I just hearing things because of the government chip implanted in my brain?""  

""It's me, love."" Rexxthar entered the kitchen.  Carol stood at the stove, a wooden spoon in one hand and a cookbook in the other.  She smiled up at Rexxthar as he ducked his head coming through the doorway.  

""Did you remember to wear your air mask? The chemtrails have been everywhere today.""  

Rexxthar rolled his eyes as he hugged his wife, careful to keep his horned forearm from dipping into the soup pot on the stove.  ""You know I'm immune to those,"" he murmured in Carol's ear.  

Carol playfully batted her husband's scaly face away.  ""Get that ten inch tongue out of here, mister!""  

Rexxthar chuckled.  Pulling away from his wife, he opened the fridge and pulled out a plain milk carton. His eyebrows rose.  ""I thought we agreed to buy organic?"" 

Carol shook her head. ""No, I was reading on the Food Babe's blog that organic milk comes from half-cow, half-whale hybrids that are strapped into scuba gear and kept submerged in vats of heavy water. I won't support that sort of animal cruelty.""  

Rexxthar opened the cupboard and stopped.  The shelves were bare.  He turned and looked questioningly at his wife.  

""Oh, I threw out all of our dishware,"" said Carol. ""It turns out that ceramic is a perfect receiver for the radiowaves from the Men In Black.""  She pursed her lips.  ""I won't have my kids listening to any more of that propaganda during mealtime.  We've got some paper plates in the cupboard.""    

Rexxthar found a red plastic cup and filled it halfway with milk.  He leaned against the counter, carefully measuring his words. 

""Honey, we need to talk.""  

Carol's back stiffened.  ""They're moving us,"" she said quietly, without turning. ""Your reassignment came through.""  

Rexxthar sipped his milk, sloshing the liquid around in his mouth, in and out of his large pointy teeth.  ""They want me to run the Greenland plant.""  

Carol whirled, her mouth open. ""*Greenland!* That's part of interior Earth, where the Nazis escaped after Hitler lost the Spear of Destiny and fled!  We can't put our children there!""  She gawked at her husband, her forehead wrinkled. ""The schools must be terrible.""  

Rexxthar stepped forward and gently put one clawed hand on his wife's shoulder.  ""Honey, please.  The Earth isn't hollow.  Remember? We talked about this, I showed you that debunking video.""  

""I guess you're right,"" said Carol, leaning her head against the smooth scales of Rexxthar's chest.  ""It's a flat Earth, not a hollow one.""  

""That's right baby,"" cooed Rexxthar, stroking her hair. ""And I'm sure there are very few Nazis in Greenland.""  

""Do they have flouride in the water?"" asked Carol, her eyes red and slightly wet.  She sniffed.  ""Do they have gold fringes on their flags?""  

""I'm... I'm not sure,"" admitted Rexxthar.  ""But I promise you, we'll make it work.  My new job will pay much more—we'll finally have enough money for a vacation.""  

""A *vacation*,"" breathed Carol, turning her head up at him and smiling with her tear-stained cheeks. ""A real one?""  

""A real one,"" said Rexxthar.  He nuzzled her ears, flicking his tongue gently along her forehead and earlobes. ""I told you Soylent Corporation would come through.""   

""I suppose,"" said Carol, with a sigh.  She scooped up a bit of soup and blew on it, tasted it.  

""What's for dinner?""  Rexxthar licked his lips. ""That smells quite savory.""  

""Oh, I'm trying that new soup that just came out, the one with Soylent Green.""

[WP] You have been shadowbanned. From life.,232C,"My pa gave me some pocket money each Saturday. Usually I saved it up - I was a sensible little lady, he used to say. 

Well this one particular Sunday was an *extremely* humid day. The talc on my back barely stopped my cotton dress from sticking to me. My parents were out for the day doing some chores and I just could not sit around melting any longer. So, I took a handful of coins out my piggy bank and walked the long track into town.

I went immediately and very excitedly to the local diner. I knew what I wanted - a cool chocolate milkshake. I had seen other kids have them and I had to watch on enviously as they sipped them up. Not today - today I had money. My own money. 

I sat down at an empty table and waited for service. Half an hour passed by, in which I looked up and down at all the amazing things on that big plastic menu, but no waiter came to my table. 45 minutes, still not a peep. I walked up to the diner bar.

""Ex - excuse me sir? I would like a chocolate milk shake."" The man behind the counter continued to busily clean and move stuff, but he didn't even look at me. I removed my glasses, trying to look older and tried some more, but no response came.

I looked around. No one in the diner was looking at me. Sometimes a head moved in my direction, but it was as if they were looking right through me. I was scared, *why could no one see me?*

It was the same story in Sally's restaurant, the barbers, the bank - no one saw me. I might as well have been a ghost.

The worst was when I tried to take the bus home. I just wanted to get back as fast as possible. Well, the driver couldn't see me and didn't even stop.

 I ran home sobbing, not knowing what was wrong with me.

My pa was back and he saw me, tears rolling down my cheeks. He picked me up and put me on his knees.

""Rosa, those people chose not to see you because they are scared and ignorant. One day soon baby, all that's going to change."" 

I knew right then that I was going to help it change. ",nickofnight
"[WP] You are a scientist at SETI in the far future, where humans are deep space-capable. Your antennas pick up a signal disturbingly similar to the WOW! Signal, and you realize it's human in origin.",GP99,"I almost fell out of my chair when the computer flashed the sequence at me. I recognised it instantly.

**6EQUJ5**

100 years ago, almost to the day, the same exact sequence had being recognised by an intern at SETI. 

No, not almost to the day. 100 years to the day *exactly.* 

I work alone on a Lunar SETI facility, far from anything and anyone. My 'home' is made out of three interconnected pods: bedroom and leisure pod, wash and pool pod, and the research centre. Looming over the pods somewhere in the darkness is the giant radio telescope. A huge satellite dish listening out for potential alien chatter.

I look again at the characters. 6EQUJ5. The WOW signal. I cross reference the location of origination against the computers estimates. It is without doubt being broadcast from within the Sagittarius cluster.

I am in a way prepared for this. The WOW signal was picked up due to how powerful it was, but it is actually a message being broadcast on the hydrogen line.

Hydrogen is the most common element in the universe, thus possibly used by extraterrestrials to send a strong signal. 

It resonates at about 1420.40575177 MHz. I switch the computers decoding matrix. The message is still being broadcast. I now have many lines of unrecognisble words display on the screen infront of me - but they are certainly words. After every 23 words the message seems to repeat.

 It is a different language but I believe it can be cracked by the SETI network. I set it to work - every idle computer on Earth begins to try possible keys and translations. It takes only hours for a positive outcome.

""Sol colony. If you are still there you must run! Come home. Do not look back. *They are coming*. Sol colony please respond.""

[WP] A new law is passed stating that anyone over the age of ninety can confess to any crime during their life with no legal repercussions. You are entrusted to write your Great Grandmothers dictation of her life.,Ribbonz3,"""When I was a little girl I stole sweets from from my uncles sweetshop.""

I sighed as I wrote down her words. This was bound to be the type of heinous crime my great granny would confess to. She didn't have a cruel bone in her body. 

""Did you get that Markus?""

""Michael, grandma. And yes.""

""That was my first crime. A crime of passion the French might have called it. I just loved sweets so much back then. Especially the little round red ones you could suck on for hours and hours. You look bored Markus.""

""No grandma, it's just - you're  90 and you can confess freely to any crime... but stealing from a sweet shop is hardly worth *confessing*.""

""Oh, well that was just my first crime. Or perhaps the first crime I knew about and understood. I think the rest of my life stemmed from the excitement I felt when pocketing a handful of candy.

""That feeling , that rush I felt, gradually subsided and I *needed* to feel it again. As I grew older I began stealing clothes that I didn't need or want.  Makeup. Jewelry. 

""I got caught of course, and my mother gave me a good beating. These days they would have sent me to a shrink, they would probably call me a 'Kleptomaniac'. But that wasn't it. I didn't need to steal. What I needed was to do something *wrong*.""

I was surprised to hear she has been such a rebel, and I looked to her with amusement. She was staring far off into the distance.

""Then the war started. I was 17 and my mother thought it would do me good to join up. There might be a role that would straighten me out. Poor mother.

""There is a test women took before joining. It was to decide if we were suitable for farm labour, factory work or paper work. My test results got me somewhere that I didn't even know existed. The Reichsschule SS. A secret women's SS unit.""

I stopped writing and looked up at my great grandma. ""Granny..."" 

""Keep writing Markus! I don't want to do this twice.

""In the Reichsschule I learned how to handle a weapon, how to manipulate men, and how to kill with my bare hands. I found a place where I was not just accepted for who I was, but admired for it. 

""The first man I killed was Polish. I was to torture him for information. If he had any, he took it to his grave. I killed many more when I worked at the surgery, helping the doctors.

""I was ruthless and it was noticed. I quickly worked my way up the ranks. Eventually I was put in charge of transportation of Jews from within greater Europe to the detention camps. I was later responsible for making them disapear from the camps. I did my job well. 

""When the war ended I was able to manipulate the British generals. I told them I was a secretary and that I was sorry for what my people had done.

 ""I moved to America and met your great grand father. We married and had your grandmother. I was happy, but I would never again be as happy as I had been during the war. ""

I looked up in disgust at this woman I thought I had known only moments ago, and I suddenly hated my country for this law that protected such a monster. She was smiling at the memories of what she had done and inflicted on people.

As I smothered her face with the cushion, I wondered if I would be confessing to this in 70 years time.

"[WP]Scientists invent a device that can determine the date of people's death. Almost everyone's date is December 31, 2016.",trjones1,"Time is an interesting concept. In actuality, ""time""—all events that can ever take place—has already taken place. We just can't see it all at once.

Think of time like a pizza in a box. It is sliced up into many pieces. Pull out a slice and you might get a moment from the past, or a moment from the future.

In reality we can't just pull out any slice we want from the box. The piece we have in our hands has a topping called 'the present'. But in the box, to the left and right of the empty space left by our slice, are more slices. The future and the past. Everything has already happened, but we can't taste the future slices until we finish our own.

I wish I had time to work on that analogy, but what I am getting at is that I created a device that allows us to 'smell' certain 'toppings' from the future. I created the quantum mechanical time distortion device. All I do is point it towards someone and it tells me when they are due to expire - their date of death.

Unfortunately everyone I ever pointed the device at had the same expiry date: December 31, 2016.

When news of this got out it led to a global frenzy, an incredible panic. What is this *event* that is going to wipe out humanity on that date? 

The governments of the world began their research and found that an asteroid due to pass very near the Earth on October 22nd, 2016 was likely the  catalyst of the catastrophe. 

Billions were poured into nuclear orbital rocket technology in an attempt to knock the asteroid off course. And, it worked! But the date did not change.

We decided on the next biggest threat - global war. Nuclear Armageddon. So humanity, for the first time in our existence, agreed to a global armistice. An incredible event that most never believed could happen and it was thanks to my device!

However, the date did not change.

Then we found *it*, on November 28th, 2016. A rare mutation of the Zeka virus had made it's way to America. It killed faster than Ebola and spread just as quick. We called it the Doomsday Virus. It had the potential to wipe out 98% of the population if it spread globally. 

We rushed to create and release an airborne chemical antidote to stop the spread. Unfortunately, in our haste we created something far worse. Something that by tomorrow, will have resulted in 99.9% of humanity dead.

If you ever read this letter, please know that we were trying to save humanity. 

I am sorry.

It had a panoramic view over large swaths of the town. My wife was the opposite side of the roof with my spare rifle. She had never fired before. I hoped she would never have to.

""Get down McGregor. We have no issue with you. It is the witch that we want!"" 

""She is no witch, Johnson,"" I reply to the sheriff. ""she is my wife and she has been falsely accused by a jelous wench! It is Linda Davis that should be on trial for the trouble she has caused!""

""If your wife is innocent then she will sink to the bottom of the lake! If she is a witch,  she will float.""

""Are you fools? You want to bind her and drown her. She will die even if she is innocent!"" Rage begins to overwhelm me. I finger my rifle expectantly.

""In which case we will pardon her good name and Linda will go on trial.  Now come down - or we come up. And then it will not just be the witch on trial!

*click click* I ready my rifle.

""We are not coming down until my wife is pardoned. You know who I am, do not upset me! Final warning!""

Someone shoot towards me but it misses by a long distance. I do not know if it was a warning shot or if the shooter is half blind. Either way I mean to reply. I take aim at the man who fired.

**Bang**

He drops to the ground. He will live, but he will not cause me trouble for some time.

They take issue with what I have done. Shots now thunder past me. I shelter my body behind the brick chimney and lean out with my rifle. 

Three well placed shots and another three men fall to the floor. But there are many more down there - I hear them trying to break through the barricaded doors downstairs.

Brick near my navel explodes into rubble. I take two more men down before I a feel a sting in my chest. I struggle for breath and fall. My wife rushes over. I hear her curse the fools below.

I do not know exactly what happens next but I see grey clouds quickly move in. They are ripe and begin to open. Lightning flashes. I hear men and women scream as a pool of crimson dyes the roof around me.

And then it is over. The clouds clear and I am calm. It is all calm. She leans over me protectively.

"[TT] ""Forever shall their ghosts haunt me, like a painful memorial etched in my soul.""",Nate_Parker,"

I recall my first soul so vividly. I remember her face better than my own. Each line, each liver spot and each wrinkle on her leathery skin. Her withered body, crippled by time and age. 

I remember the gentle whisper and her warm breath as she told me she was ready. She smiled at me as I twisted my hand deep down into her heart and plucked out her soul. Her body shrugged down limply, in a cold finality.

Then, she was free from her prision. As her soul danced around me  it began to sing a song - a song so beauitful that I wept. 

I gently took her hand and led her to the path. There I left her, for she was to make the final journey alone.

It is not always so easy. When the children are destoryed by cancer and I come to relieve them from the suffering, it is not so easy. When their parents stand by them and hold their tiny hands, clinging onto them with a desperate, vain hope, it is not so easy.

Still l must plunge my hand into their little hearts and rip away their life.  Forever shall their ghosts haunt me, like a painful memory etched in my soul. 

When mothers die as children are born. When war takes those who are innocent. When hearts are malformed and can not keep beating. I am there to help them, but they do not always want my help. They curse and spit, or cry and beg. And still I must pay my penance and take them away.

I am Death and I carry the burdens of humanity. You must not hate or fear me. Now take my hand.

""Then they arrived. Beings from another solar system. Highly advanced but murderous lunatics. They had razor sharp beaks and long claws. They wanted Earth but without humanity.""

The children's mouths were open wide.

""We fought bravely but we were losing. That is when I was evacuated to my new home here on Mecury. A few were sent here, a few to other planets and other moons, in the hope that they wouldn't find all of us.""

A little boy began crying.  Another young lad put an arm around his shoulders.

""The aliens took Earth from us, but they regretted it. We had planted enough giant bombs throughout the Earth's core to destroy the entire planet, and with it, the aliens. Even their mothership floating in orbit was destroyed. It was the greatest explosion  the universe has ever known. We had won.""

"[WP] You know when people will die, you are a mortician trying to sell caskets.",MonkeyWithAGun42,"I usually measure them up with my eyes before I get to work. I have got rather good at it. I learned early on in my career that I should always go slightly larger than I need, just in case.

I build the coffins myself. You are impressed, I see. Well, I have always been good with my hands. Just ask my parents. If I hadn't buried them I mean! I am sorry, I have a strange sense of humour - 'morbid', my parents used to say. It might grow on you, you never know.

I get paid better for larger coffins. They require more materials and more time. You will understand why then, I look out for the bigger people. The freakishly tall and the *morbidly* obese - *ahahaha*

So, I find one of these freaks of nature and I know that they don't have long left on this world. They are a heart attack waiting to happen. A breath away from death. I just, give them a helping hand.

I'm not a heart doctor. I would't know *exactly* when a person is going to die, if I didn't influence factors slightly. The poison - yes poison - mimics the symptoms of a heart attack. Authorities are not surprised to see Bill the Pig, or All-You-Can-Eat-Martha, dead of heart disease. 

And yes, it is a little convenient that I am always around to offer my services. I guess I need to be more careful. Is that how you found me?

How tall are you detective? Oh please don't slur, it is so unbecoming. No matter, I am quite good at this. 6 foot one exactly, I would say.  I think it is time I got to work.

"[WP] Late night, you are alone on a dirt road in the middle of nowwhere. You find an abandoned car and get out to examine it. You also find a beat-up cellphone. As you pick it up, it lights up, and someone calls you.",PalePrincessSnowWite,"Head lights lazily shine across the old road, illuminating it in unwanted shadows. I slow down as I approach the lights and I see a car with its bonnet open lying just off the road.

I pull over and exit my car. 

""Hello?"" I yell into the night. ""Anyone there? Do you need a hand?""

A hoot from an owl in the trees above is my only response. I shiver and grab a jacket and flashlight from my car. I head over to the broken down vehicle.

It is a Peugeot and it looks pretty beaten up. 

""Hello?"" I say, quieter his time as I cautiously aim the stream of light through the drivers window. The car is more of a mess inside than out. The seat is stained with dried liquid. Drink cans and sweet wrappers decorate the floor. There is a horrible stench radiating out from the car.

I direct the torch onto the passenger seat. Shadows dance inside like restless spirits. This seat is also stained. There is a map lying on the seat and I can make out a thick red circle marking a location.

Before I turn my attention to the back of the car a sudden high pitched shriek pierces the silence of the night. I feel my heart tighten and stumble backwards over a fallen branch. I land hard on my back and a plume of dust rises around me.

It is just a phone ringing in the car. I heave myself up, rubbing my now tender back. A light is shining from the seat behind the drivers. I struggle to pull open the rusted door but eventually it gives.

I immediately see where the smell is coming from. Next to the flashing phone is some kind of roadkill. It is split down the middle, guts protruding out and it is covered in its own dried blood.

I reach past it and quickly snatch the mobile. It is an old Nokia. Some of the blood from the dead animal has splattered onto it giving it a morbid decor.

It is still ringing - whoever is in the other end is desperate to get through to someone.

""Hello?"" I whisper.

Heavy breathing replies. It is followed by grunting and eventually a thick, dark voice.

""I am watching you. I see you in your expensive red jacket.""

I momentarily freeze, but soon begin to peer around into the deep darkness.

""Where are you? Do you need help - I can give you a lift."" I say. I am beggining to tremble.

The voice breaks into a laugh. 

""It is not *me* that needs help. Do not move or you are fucking dead. Do what I say from now on, or you are fucking dead.""

Before I can reply a bullet hits a stone near my feet.  I drop the phone. The noise from the rifle echoes in my head.


The phone must have disconnected as it hit the floor, as it soon rings again and lights up the dirt floor. It takes me sometime to gather my thoughts and to eventually answer.

""Wh-what do you want?"" I say feebly. I feel like vomiting but hold it together.

""In the front of the car is a map. Take it.""

I slowly walk around the car and open the passenger door. I take the map.

""You see the red circle?""

I do. It is in the middle of nowhere. No roads near it.

""You are going there. Put the bonnet down and get inside this car.""",nickofnight

In other words, it's been discussed to death (heh), but the general mod stance is to let reddit work like reddit works.

* What is your favorite moment in the writing process?

[WP] Write the ultimate battle of good vs. evil... from the perspective of the Dark Lord's child.,DoctorSoda,"&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Perched precariously atop the ragged cliffs of Erosmere rested a castle known the world over as the “Black Clove,” but to Senka it was home. She sat atop the abandoned plinth that held gilded steel railing, binding the black marble balcony in a vine of garnet encrusted leaves. Opposite her, on the left to the two front plinths, sat a rough carved gargoyle, snarling at the winds with its one broken wing.  

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Year before, they had been a pair, and Senka remembered it vividly. Her skin still prickled at the thought of watching the gargoyle, whose perch she now occupied, tumbling across the jagged edges that protruded from Erosmere. 

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; A tug at her tunic drew her back from memory, and turned her head. Before her stood a knight, wrapped in armor bearing the same gilded vines and broken wings that emblazoned her father’s standard. Beneath his guard were fine, patterned silks whose cerulean sheen was dulled by the specks of blood and grime that spread upon them. 

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “Your father has told you on numerous accounts not to sit there, Princess,” he said. 

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “There’s blood in your beard, Sir Warin,” replied Senka. “Why are you here?”

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; As she turned away, the knight ran a finger through the braided, grey knots that framed his otherwise sunken face and frowned. Senka had known Warin all her life, he had served as her protector for all of her ten years. She felt his worry on her back, though his hand once more held her tunic in place as she watched the valley below. 

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Upon the widowed fields of Terratraus, fires burned among men and horses dotting every direction. The plain she had once galloped through with her mother was now a smoldering crater, hewn by the dreads of cants and cries. The latest of these white fire sermons seared through a column of cavalry that hoped to enter the fray. 

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “We must go, Princess,” said Sir Warin. “The King insists—” 

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “I asked you to stay with him,” replied Senka. “Why are you here?”

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “I think you know precisely why I’m here,” said Sir Warin. “Your father sent me to take you away, before they take this castle.”

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Senka said nothing, she instead watched the story unfolding below. A flood of new invaders arrived from beyond the mouth of the valley, marching in a slow and deliberate manner toward the heart of the fight.

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “Why are they doing this?” she asked, her tone more defeated that she intended. “Why won’t they leave us alone?”

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “Why indeed,” mused Sir Warin. His nails dragged a little as his clutch on her tunic tightened. “Why did they harass our borders? Why did they strike down our emissaries? Why did they burn your…”

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; He trailed off on the last, but Senka finished the thought, “Why did they burn mother alive?”

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; After a silence, broken by the howling below, she asked, “They don’t like us, do they?” 

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “No, they don’t.”

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “But why? Because we ignore their gods? Because we live in the same way we have since my ancestors occupied this castle? They burned her alive because she brandished they precious spell-craft, because she taught it to anyone willing to learn. They call us villains, they think we’re evil because we choose to live our way…”

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “I see you’ve been listening to you tutors. Your father warned her against that, but she insisted on traveling through their lands.”

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “So? She only wanted to help them, she only wanted to…they killed her without reason. They killed her…”

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “They killed her and goaded your father into a war he’ll never win,” said Sir Warin. He picked her up off the plinth and set her down on the balcony, she was always staggered when facing the brute of a man on equal ground. She was small for her age and barely managed to match the man’s waist. “He’s down there, fighting them, but he can’t win.”

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; She felt a surge of protest, but was cut short as he continued, “No, he can’t. If he could win, I wouldn’t have been sent here. Now listen,” he kneeled and met her gaze. “I know there must be some hundred worries floating through that little head of yours, Princess, but right now we need to focus on one thing, and one thing only…we need to run.”

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “We need to fight,” she replied. Senka balled up both her fists and slammed them down the knight’s shoulders, her left came away bleeding as it scraped across a gilded vine. 

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “Someday, we may,” said Sir Warin. He took a dagger from his belt and cut away a length of silk from the cuff of his left hand. Warin carefully bandaged her bleeding hand and rested his grimy left paw upon her branch-like shoulder, “But for now, we run.”

The plain she had once galloped through with her mother was now a smoldering crater, hewn by the dreads of cants and cries. The latest of these white fire sermons seared through a column of cavalry that hoped to enter the fray. 

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “We must go, Princess,” said Sir Warin. “The King insists—” 

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “I asked you to stay with him,” replied Senka. “Why are you here?”

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “I think you know precisely why I’m here,” said Sir Warin. “Your father sent me to take you away, before they take this castle.”

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Senka said nothing, she instead watched the story unfolding below. A flood of new invaders arrived from beyond the mouth of the valley, marching in a slow and deliberate manner toward the heart of the fight.

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “Why are they doing this?” she asked, her tone more defeated that she intended. “Why won’t they leave us alone?”

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “Why indeed,” mused Sir Warin. His nails dragged a little as his clutch on her tunic tightened. “Why did they harass our borders? Why did they strike down our emissaries? Why did they burn your…”

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; He trailed off on the last, but Senka finished the thought, “Why did they burn mother alive?”

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; After a silence, broken by the howling below, she asked, “They don’t like us, do they?” 

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “No, they don’t.”

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “But why? Because we ignore their gods? Because we live in the same way we have since my ancestors occupied this castle? They burned her alive because she brandished they precious spell-craft, because she taught it to anyone willing to learn. They call us villains, they think we’re evil because we choose to live our way…”

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “I see you’ve been listening to you tutors. Your father warned her against that, but she insisted on traveling through their lands.”

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “So? She only wanted to help them, she only wanted to…they killed her without reason. They killed her…”

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “They killed her and goaded your father into a war he’ll never win,” said Sir Warin. He picked her up off the plinth and set her down on the balcony, she was always staggered when facing the brute of a man on equal ground. She was small for her age and barely managed to match the man’s waist. “He’s down there, fighting them, but he can’t win.”

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; She felt a surge of protest, but was cut short as he continued, “No, he can’t. If he could win, I wouldn’t have been sent here. Now listen,” he kneeled and met her gaze. “I know there must be some hundred worries floating through that little head of yours, Princess, but right now we need to focus on one thing, and one thing only…we need to run.”

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “We need to fight,” she replied. Senka balled up both her fists and slammed them down the knight’s shoulders, her left came away bleeding as it scraped across a gilded vine. 

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “Someday, we may,” said Sir Warin. He took a dagger from his belt and cut away a length of silk from the cuff of his left hand. Warin carefully bandaged her bleeding hand and rested his grimy left paw upon her branch-like shoulder, “But for now, we run.”

[OT] Sunday Free Write: Motivational Edition,you-are-lovely,"**Early Riser**

The horizon is ablaze with light. The sun is rising.

From my high perch in the old oak tree, I look down into the valley far below. The trees are a deep and verdant green, but soon they will change to their fall colors. The river flows but only sluggishly, a thin layer of fog lingers on its nearly placid surface. A light breeze moves through the trees and I detect the ripple of leaves as it moves across the face of the forest.

Near the base of the oak I spy two squirrels as they chase each other around and around the trunk of the tree. They eventually work their way upwards as the game continues. Finally the leader runs along a branch and in a great leap that seems almost preternatural, it is suddenly in an adjacent tree. It scampers away and is gone.

The squirrel that had been following is now left behind. It starts chattering in that nervous way that squirrels do. The creature almost seems unhappy the chase has ended.

I briefly ponder the meaning. Were they friends playing a game? Was it a territorial conflict? I shall never know the reason.

I spread my wings as the sun climbs over the bluffs, shaking the dew from my feathers.

Down on the bank of the river, a lone white tailed deer approaches the water. She looks around, and after making sure nothing is approaching that might threaten her, she lowers her head to drink. She raises her head from time to time, just to make sure her situation remains unchanged and that she is still alone.

After drinking her fill she turns, and in one great sudden leap disappears back into the forest.

The sun has warmed me sufficiently now, my feathers have dried from their night time dampness. I stretch my body and wings, sensing all is ready.

I launch myself from the branch, catching the air with my wings and soar over the valley. I follow the river for a while until the land climbs towards the bluffs. Great limestone battlements guard the river here.

Below, near the mud flats, a raccoon daintily washes it's tiny paws in the river. It looks up at me, and is suddenly gone.

I wheel in the sky as I spot a group of crows. They will be looking for trouble. I have no time for them this morning. I have other business to attend to.

I dive to increase my speed, leaving them behind for the moment. As I reach the trees on the opposite bank from the limestone bluffs, I swoop upwards and pump my powerful wings. Finally I level out, riding the wind. Soaring high over the pastures, I am now in my hunting ground.

Time passes. How much I cannot say. The rush of the wind, the feeling of flight, sensing the world around me. Time is time. It simply is.

A moment later, or perhaps a lifetime, I spy prey. Down in the fields below a mouse scampers across the bare expanse of closely cropped grass. There is no place for it to hide before I can take it. The mouse knows this, yet still it tries.

I have to admire the mouse for this. It fights to survive, as we all do in whatever way is available to us. The sudden realization hits me. It is our struggle that defines us.

Diving, I extend my talons towards the doomed mouse.

Suddenly something intrudes. A buzzing. Some outside sound I cannot ignore.

My hand slaps the alarm clock off and I sit up in bed, pushing the blankets down towards my feet. I rub the sleep from my eyes and look at the clock.

I think for a moment of my dream. Knowing that for just an instant, I knew the joy of flight.

I remember my epiphany as I rise from bed. I stand there a moment pondering it.

I go forth, to continue my own struggle. ",SurvivorType

In exchange for a lighter sentence, he was given the opportunity to use his skills in the employment of the devil, scamming the damned and convincing the living to give up their souls. Hi! Billy Mays here, and have I got a deal for YOU!",Syncs,"Phineas sat back in his chair idly playing with his cigarette lighter.  They might be colleagues in this strange occupation but that didn’t mean Billy had to trust him.  He liked the man – it was difficult not to like someone as charismatic as Phineas – but it always felt like he was trying to get one up on him.

&amp;nbsp;

“When’s the boss gonna show up?” Billy asked.  They’d been waiting a while now, but one couldn’t exactly walk out of a performance review with the Lord of Hell.

&amp;nbsp;

“You’ll learn to be patient working here,” Phineas told him as he flicked his lighter open and closed, “the boss works to his own schedule.  Besides, you’re dead.  You don’t have anywhere else to be.”

&amp;nbsp;

“I’ve got product to sell,” Billy countered.  Life hadn’t changed that much since he’d died.  There was less and less downtime between sales pitches and no mansion to go home to at the end of the day.  He kind of liked it though, it reminded him of the old days hustling in Atlantic City.

&amp;nbsp;

“The product sells itself,” Phineas replied, “love, comfort, power.  You don’t need to convince people that they want those things.  It’s not like selling tickets to a freak show or whatever junk it was you used to shill for.”

&amp;nbsp;

“It wasn’t junk.  I sold people things they needed.”

&amp;nbsp;

“Well ya still are.  Things that they need a hell of a lot more than cleaning products.  Don’t you just love the way their eyes light up when they realise they can finally have what they’ve spent so much time longing after?  You’re doing good Billy.”

&amp;nbsp;

Billy looked up at his senior with doubt.  Taking money from people had been one thing, there was no lasting harm in that and maybe they really *did* need a necktie with a hidden pocket.  What they were taking now on behalf of the boss though…

&amp;nbsp;

“Don’t give me that look,” Phineas admonished, “you think we’re not the good guys?”

&amp;nbsp;

“We literally work for Satan,” Billy pointed out.  He could never tell whether Phineas believed himself or if everything he said was self-serving half-truths.

&amp;nbsp;

“We fill an important need.  Why should some people suffer in poverty and loneliness when we can fix it?”

&amp;nbsp;

“What do you think the boss does with all those souls?” Billy asked, not so subtly changing the topic.

&amp;nbsp;

“Don’t know, don’t care,” Phineas shrugged.  Billy knew at least half of that statement was a lie.  Phineas was a lot of things, but lacking in curiosity wasn’t one of them.

&amp;nbsp;

Just as Billy was about to push him on the topic for the twentieth time in as many months, they were interrupted by a flickering of the room’s feeble illumination.  Their boss stepped out of empty air into the centre of the room.

&amp;nbsp;

“Good evening Mr Mays, Mr Barnum,” he said with a nod to the seated men.  He conjured a large, ornate dagger out of nowhere.  “Your apprenticeship is almost over Billy.  One final test and I’ll be ready to set you free to conduct my business on Earth.”

&amp;nbsp;

Billy quavered a little at the predatory smile their overseer was shooting his way.  The final test was different for everyone, he’d gathered that much from Phineas.  The fact that even the usually boisterous Phineas had refused to share with him what his own test had been made it clear that it was no small thing that was about to be asked of him.

&amp;nbsp;

""I'm ready,"" he lied.  Visions of being asked to murder his wife in a test of loyalty or enable a massacre flashed through his mind as The Devil handed him the blood stained dagger.

&amp;nbsp;

""Good,"" replied the Prince of Darkness, ""this is the steak knife of the damned.  Sell it to me.""",herd_of_birds
"[WP] Upon his death, Billy Mays wound up in Hell.

Billy Mays here, and have I got a deal for YOU!",Syncs,"Oh boy.  This was not good.  Not good at all.  It was impossible to see through the solid darkness but the heat and the choking smell of sulphur hung in the air.  It was too hot to even be Florida.  Billy was already gathering an inkling of where he might be.

&amp;nbsp;

After an indeterminate amount of time, his eyes had adjusted enough to make out a solitary figure standing opposite him in the blackness.  The man – if the dim silhouette was indeed a man – stood as unmoving as a statue.

&amp;nbsp;

“Hey there, I’m Billy and – ”

&amp;nbsp;

“I know who you are,” the figure stated before falling silent again.

&amp;nbsp;

“Uh, that’s great,” Billy replied, slightly crestfallen at having his momentum derailed.

&amp;nbsp;

“I have a job for you”

&amp;nbsp;

“Sorry, I didn’t quite catch your name there, buddy.”  The stench of sulphur was getting stronger.  Billy refused to admit how far out of his element he was.  He could sell ice to the Eskimos, he could sure convince this stranger to help him.

&amp;nbsp;

“I’m a salesman too, Billy.  The best salesman of all.”

&amp;nbsp;

“What’s your game?  White goods?  Diet supplements?  I’m sure I could help you hit the big time if you’d just help me get outta here.”

&amp;nbsp;

“Hahaha,” came the raspy laugh in reply, “I *am* the big time, Billy.  You’re a hell of a salesman and I could train you to be an even better one.  I could help *you* hit the big time Billy for nothing but the low, low cost of your loyalty and servitude.  It’s a limited time offer only, Billy.  Can’t you feel it getting hotter in here?”

&amp;nbsp;

It was getting hotter.  Alarmingly so.  But ole Billy Mays wasn’t going to fall for the sales pitch he’d practically invented.

&amp;nbsp;

“No deal,” said Billy, “just show me the way out of here.”

&amp;nbsp;

“If you act now, I’ll throw in the way out of here for free.  But wait, there’s more,” parroted the man who Billy was becoming increasingly sure was Satan, “I’ll even throw in a lifetime, money back guaranteed supply of cocaine.  The good stuff, the stuff you like.”

&amp;nbsp;

“What sort of job?” Billy asked with a cocked eyebrow as curiosity overtook common sense.

&amp;nbsp;

“Same job you’ve always done Billy.  I just want a salesman.  Come join the oldest corporation in the business.”

&amp;nbsp;

Billy couldn’t help but be entranced by the extended hand the figure was offering.  So what if the man might be Beelzebub himself?  He wouldn’t be the worst boss he’d ever worked for.  And the man had made quite the pitch.

&amp;nbsp;

“When do I start?” Billy asked.

&amp;nbsp;

“You already have,” replied the creature with a toothy grin, “welcome to the team.”

Billy Mays here, and have I got a deal for YOU!",Syncs,"For the first time in decades Billy Mays found himself at a momentary loss for words.  It only lasted a few seconds.  *I’m Billy Mays,* he reminded himself, *I can sell anything to anyone.*  Never mind that anyone was a fallen angel turned king of the damned.  He snapped into the familiar routine of pulling together a pitch on the fly just like he had a million times before he’d died.

&amp;nbsp;

“Mr Beezlebub, I know you’re a busy man.  You’ve got a lot on your plate literally and figuratively.  You can’t afford to waste time sawing through a poorly prepared slab of sinner’s flesh.  We’ve all been there, it’s tough.”

&amp;nbsp;

He could almost feel Phineas nodding along to his words in supportive agreement behind him.  He wondered whether Phineas had ever tried to saw through human flesh or if they were both liars.

&amp;nbsp;

“I used to have that problem, but not anymore!” Billy exclaimed, trying to forget the fact that he was trying to sell an eldritch knife to a creature that could extirpate his soul with a blink.  “With this top of the range dagger forged using genuine obsidian fragments from Cain’s knife and bathed in the blood of innocents, you’ll never need to struggle again.  How much would you expect to pay for an unholy relic like this?”

&amp;nbsp;

Satan continued to stare at him expectantly instead of answering the question.  If he was going to be a hard sell that was just fine.  *I’m Billy Mays!  He may be Lord of The Flies, but I’m Lord of the Sales Pitch!*

&amp;nbsp;

“The big box stores would have you believe that a dagger like this would be unobtainable for anyone short of Mammon.  They don’t want you to know the truth though,” Billy dropped his voice to a conspiratorial whisper, “this knife could be all yours for just three easy payments of $9.99.  And that’s not all!  If you take this soul corrupting monstrosity of a knife off my hands right now I’ll throw in Phineas’ soul for free!”

&amp;nbsp;

“I already have Phineas’ soul, but that wasn’t too bad.  I’ll let you live for now,” Satan stated, drowning out the mumbled objections from Billy’s colleague in the background.  The Source of All Evil took a step backwards and slipped back out of existence.

&amp;nbsp;

“Wait, he was going to kill me?” Billy asked dropping the twisted, blood stained blade to his side.

&amp;nbsp;

“Eh, don’t lose any sleep over it,” Phineas told him, wrapping an arm around his young mentee’s shoulder.  “Satan’s a tough boss but fair-ish.”

&amp;nbsp;

“He…he was going to kill me again,” Billy muttered to himself in disbelief.

"[CW] Break my heart, without writing about romance or death.",Aevery_,"Jim worked hard for his family.  He knew what it was like to be poor, what it was like to go to bed with an empty stomach.  He never wanted that for his son.  When he cradled his child in his arms he swore to himself that he’d never let little Leo know what it was like to go without.

&amp;nbsp;

It took a lot to keep that promise, but a labour of love was barely a labour at all.  The endless nights at the office.  Weeks at a time spent on business trips.  It ate away at his resolve, but every time he remembered who he was doing it for he woke up the next morning ready for another round with the world.

&amp;nbsp;

The sacrifices only became heavier as the years wore on.  Even after so long with his nose to the grindstone he knew it only took a momentary lapse to slide back into poverty.  He couldn’t imagine forcing Leo to endure that and so he kept up the fight to keep them afloat no matter what.

&amp;nbsp;

When they said things got better they lied.  It only became harder to bear the burden.  It didn’t matter.  Jim had strong shoulders on which to carry the weight of his sorrows.  It was all worth it when he saw Leo emerge strong, independent, vibrant into adulthood.  After so many years he felt like he could finally see what all his sacrifices had been for.

&amp;nbsp;

At long last he felt that he could shrug off some of his responsibilities and live life.  There was a small party at work, quickly forgotten.  Then it was home to work out what to do with this unfamiliar freedom.  He wondered if his son might visit him, he never did.  Jim didn’t mind too much.  Leo had a life of his own now and he wouldn’t want it any other way.

&amp;nbsp;

Another decade passed in that slowly sudden way that time does.  Eventually a lifetime of bad habits collided with a moment of bad luck and propelled Jim off the mortal coil.  Calls were made and a funeral hastily thrown together.

&amp;nbsp;

Somewhere on the other side of the country Leo heard the news.  For a moment he questioned whether he should even go.  The old man had spent every moment absorbed in his work.  When Leo had played in his first softball game he’d been in Arizona on a business trip.  When he’d been celebrating his birthdays Dad had always been working the weekend.  When he’d been bawling his eyes out over the bullies at school Dad had been powering through late night meetings at the office.  He’d never been much of a father to Leo.  He swore that his own children would never know what it was like to be neglected like that.  They’d never know what it was like to go without.

"[WP] A ""popular"" girl falls in love with a ""nerdy"" boy, however he hates her and she spends all her time trying to impress him",pacachii,"Samantha couldn’t help herself.  Every boy in the school was chasing her.  A lot of them had already had her and wanted more.  She enjoyed teasing them.  It was all too easy.

&amp;nbsp;

They say forbidden fruit is the finest.  After gorging herself on so much adoration, it was the only thing that Samantha could taste at all.  It was no surprise then that she found herself falling for the first boy who simply didn’t seem to care about her.

&amp;nbsp;

At first she’d assumed it was just because he thought he had no chance with her.  It was true of course, there was no way she’d even bother speaking to a loser like him, she’d thought.  It still irked her that he wouldn’t even throw a glance her way.

&amp;nbsp;

It annoyed her enough that she broke her cardinal rule and actually stooped to speaking to the little mouth breather.  She teased, she flirted, he barely looked up from his textbook.  He was getting good grades, it’s not like he had anything else going for him.  He was distinctly average, no skills, no friends, nothing to make him at all noteworthy.  Yet he somehow thought he could ignore her advances?  This wasn’t going to stand.

&amp;nbsp;

Subtlety went out the window as the months rolled past.  At first she’d been worried that pursuing him would make her look bad in front of her friends.  By the end she didn’t care, this was a point of pride for Samantha and she was going to break his resistance.  They mysteriously ended up in the same group for every project, she sat with him at lunch and tried to strike up conversation, shot him glances across the room and everything else she’d ever read about in Cosmo.

&amp;nbsp;

Rumours started to swirl around the school.  It didn’t take a sharp eye to spot her pursuit of the poor little nerd.  Mixed with the level of envy that constantly swirled around Samantha’s clique it made for an explosive scandal.  Everyone was talking about Samantha and her would-be paramour – everyone but he himself.

&amp;nbsp;

He shrugged off confessions, ignored thinly veiled propositions and just generally remained oblivious.  He had to be doing it on purpose, Samantha decided.  Well, if subtlety – what little she’d exercised – didn’t work, then maybe she’d just come out and say it.  It was social suicide, but what had started as a minor annoyance had wormed its way deep enough into her insecurities that she no longer cared.

&amp;nbsp;

She cornered him behind the bike shed during their lunchbreak.  She’d spent so much time sitting here with him, suggestively playing with the hem of her skirt and the buttons on her blouse while he stared at his goddamn textbooks.

&amp;nbsp;

Samantha took a deep breath and prepared herself to throw away what little dignity she had left.  This had gone on far too long.

&amp;nbsp;

“So, you know how prom’s coming up?” she asked, twirling a loose hair around her finger as she smiled coquettishly at the only man who’d ever resisted her substantial charms.

&amp;nbsp;

“Uh, yeah,” he croaked.  Even his voice was awkward.  It was absurd that he wouldn’t leap at the chance to get with this.

&amp;nbsp;

“Well, I don’t have a date, do you?”

&amp;nbsp;

“Ugggh, no.”

&amp;nbsp;

“So maybe we should go together.  I think you’re super cute.”

&amp;nbsp;

“Er, Samantha, I…”

&amp;nbsp;

“You will!” she excitedly finished the sentence for him, “great!  You can pick me up at six.  I’m going to wear pink, so pick a tux that compliments it, ok?”

&amp;nbsp;

“Uggh, Samantha, I’m…I’m gay,” he finished with an apologetic shrug at the crestfallen cheerleader.

As I walked up, I noticed an abnormal number of cars littering the area, some even double-parked on our street. *Must be some kind of party. Damnit, Dad.*

The front door was unlocked, and the main room was entirely empty, but I could hear some commotion upstairs and slowly creeped up to see what was going on. There were at least fifty people packed into the upper floor, like sardines. I recognized a few of them as aunts or uncles, though some I'd never seen.

""Oh, sweetie, you're home. Come this way,"" my Aunt Jane said, planting a fat kiss on my forehead. She dragged me through the crowd and into my father's room, where my dad was bundled under the covers with an IV running into his arm.

""Hey, buddy,"" he said softly with a weak smile. I walked up to him and furrowed my brow.

""Dad, what's going on? Why are all these people here?""

He grabbed my hand and patted it. ""I've been trying to keep this from you as long as possible, but I can't anymore.""

""Dad, what are you talking about?"" I asked wildly, heart pounding against my chest as if trying to break free. ""I'm confused.""

""Hi, Confused,"" he said, gripping my hand. A single tear flowed from his left eye. ""I'm Dying.""

Chris Mayer, the freshmen who just joined high school, was loved by everyone immediately. The girls, the guys, the jocks, the losers- everyone wanted to be his friend. Me? It was my senior year. 

One day, I was eating lunch in a bathroom stall and just grew sick of it all. Sick of the unfair bullshit, the way people were nice to him but hated me. It was just because of his cancer, I knew it damn well. Worst of all was the way he smiled at me, or waved and said hi to me like nothing was wrong. It was him I hated most. 

June 19th: the day I graduated from high school. My uncle was there, but no other family, and certainly no friends. Yet there that little bastard was, IV rack in hand, cheering and clapping for the senior class. Someone dedicated a speech to him. Everyone gathered around him after the ceremony. My uncle left halfway through, before I even got on stage. 

I left before the midnight party began, just after sunset. Since my uncle had abandoned me, I was forced to take a bus stop that was almost a mile away. I took a shortcut through a side alleyway to the building our graduation had been held in, where I found Chris bent over and retching violently.

""Oh, dear,"" he said weakly, forcing a small laugh. ""I came here so no one would see me like this. It's pretty bad these days.""

No words formed in my mind; there was only an animalistic rage swirling, mudding my thoughts. I pummeled the living shit out of that frail, little boy. Every punch was vindication, every tooth knocked loose a symbol for my shattered dignity. Soon I was just taking out all my angers on him; my family, my loneliness, my uselessness. He was an emotional punching bag I'd made literal.

By the time I stopped, it was too late. Fuck, there was so much blood on me and the road, and his twisted little body. And yet, through labored breaths, through broken bones and missing teeth, he tried to smile. He tried to say something to me as well, but the blood pooling in his throat left the words inaudible before he started choking. 

I ran. I didn't call for help, I just ran. No one caught me, somehow, and he died that night in a hospital bed. Not from the cancer eating away at him, but from my fists. I cried the whole night, and couldn't sleep for three days because every time I closed my eyes, I saw his mangled little face trying to smile. That whole time, it was *me* I hated, not him. 

That night, I went home and punched myself in the face as hard as I could. I wanted to give myself a taste of what I'd given the poor boy in his last few hours, to feel what he felt, but no matter how many times I hit my face... I felt nothing. I checked a mirror to see if I'd just broken myself, but I looked sharper than ever.

Ever since then, I've haven't been able to hurt someone with a punch. In fact...I heal them, like my hands are imbued with the life I stole from him. Hands I'm afraid of, because I know he's haunting me.

I don't know how...

...but I wish they'd worked that way on the day I graduated.

What is that sinful *abomination* doing at the table with us?"" Pope Francis asked wildly, his hat bobbing. There were three other people sitting with him, and two weren't even *people*.

""Surely, human, you can be a more civilized guest in this hall,"" an enormous, purple, furry being stated firmly. It looked like Yogi bear, if Yogi had been raised a meth addict.

""Oh, not you, sir. *Him*."" Francis was pointing at Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS, who spat on the table in response.

""I'd say he brought us here for a discussion amongst the enlightened, but you are here,"" Abu Bakr responded in perfect Spanish. The Pope raised his eyebrows, turning to the aliens.

""Yes, we noticed your species still cannot communicate amongst itself properly- I don't know how you can voyage into space but not speak with one another, though that is another issue entirely. We have set up a universal communication rig, so you can communicate freely,"" one of the aliens responded.

""What is it you would like from us?"" Francis asked surprisingly calmly.

""Answers. We have been watching your species for some time now, and we would like to know a few things. First of all, why does your species have religion at this stage in development?""

Abu Bakr snickered. ""Allah is the reason we exist. We aim to please him, by purging the world of those who would be unfit in his eyes.""

Francis groaned, rubbing at his temples. ""Look, your species seems very intelligent. I would love to discuss these issues with you, but this guy here, he's... well, you know. Insane? Religion is a vessel by which we explore ourselves, our souls, and connect with God. This man uses it as a vice to harm others.""

""You did not answer my question. Why do you still believe in it? The books were written when your species still believed that Earth was the center of the universe. It has sections that don't make any sense at all, clearly written by men. Why do you still believe it?""

""It was written by men, yes,"" Francis answered, ""but the message is God's alone. We are here to live proper lives and do what we can to help others. We are God's servants, and each day is a test of our faith. Time will not change that, not in any way.""

""And you? What do you say?"" The alien asked the ISIS leader.

""I say this man and his ideals are trash. Nothing but lies meant to lead people down the wrong path, away from Allah.""

""You did not answer my question. Why do you still believe it?""

""Because it is the written word.""

""Okay...that- that's the only reason why?""

""Yes, it is the written word and we will purge everyone who disagrees.""

""If I may, this man is the worst representative you could have chosen,"" Francis interjected. ""I have read the Qu'ran, three times now, and it is a book of love and unity. Too often to men mistake their personal angers for God's will, as if they are prophets themselves.""

Abu Bakr tried to respond, but the alien disallowed it. ""I see. Your species is...odd. It has appeared to evolve in stages.""

""Stages?""

""Yes, stages. Those who have realized that their gods were made up to control and comfort the masses through human emotion, those who still believe it but attempt to better society with it, and those who still view it as a weapon. Staggered evolution, how incredibly odd. And to think, you can't even speak the same language. No wonder your species is in such constant turmoil. How you even made it this far is beyond me...""

""You insult Allah, you are an enemy combatant to me,"" Abu Bakr shouted, standing up. The quiet alien vaporized him with some kind of laser.

""Grngk, I told you no weapons! Look at what you've done now! The humans will hate us, we are supposed to be a diplomatic people!""

Francis leaned back, raising his eyebrows. ""Now, normally, I object to that sort of thing, but...I think that in this case, we can make an exception.""

Sorry to hear you're going through such a tough time right now and that academics are so challenging. I hope you get a break soon! This was a nice piece of writing. I haven't noticed a lot of abstract pieces like this here. It was enjoyable to read. :)",you-are-lovely
[OT] Sunday Free Write: Motivational Edition,you-are-lovely,"**WHAT IF**

For years I wouldn’t acknowledge my love of writing. I clutched that secret so tightly to my chest that I wouldn’t even speak it aloud for fear that the very breath from my lips would cause the hope, the possibility of success to fall apart. In my heart the dream lived on and yet I did nothing to further it. I feared putting my whole heart into something only to have it be a waste of time.

I remember being in high school and thinking about how perfect my life was going to be when I was older. Then one day I was older and nothing was the way I’d imagined. I thought I’d failed and that the place I was at then was where I was going to stay for the rest of my life. Over time I built a new idea of what my life was going to look like in the future and when that didn’t turn out the way I imagined, again I thought I’d failed. Somewhere along the way I came to the conclusion that dreams are all I will ever get and that they are only meant to be real for others. It became a lot easier to hide those dreams deep in my heart than to pursue them. I lived that way for a while before deciding that that wasn’t what I wanted. I didn’t want to watch my life slip past me, because it was easier than participating in it. 

---

Fear can be a powerful motivating force. Either to make you do something you don’t want to, or prevent you from doing something you do. Fear of failure can be paralyzing, but failing does not make you a failure. People fail all the time. It’s not the end, it’s merely one stop on a long road. Don’t be afraid of failing. Don’t cringe when it happens. Accept it, embrace it, learn from it, and then move past it. It’s easy to become a passive player in life instead of fighting for more. It’s easy to believe that what you have is good enough, because to really try means making yourself open to rejection, and nobody likes being rejected. 

Pursuing a dream is hard. The difference between someone who succeeds and someone who doesn’t, is often simply that the person who succeeded got back up again. They decided that each failure was not going to be the end of their journey. They dusted off their pants, put ice on their bruised ego, picked up their damaged heart, and fought again. They chose to be tougher than defeat and believed that they could handle the brutal pursuit of a dream.

---

* What if.
* What if instead of giving up on your dream, you put everything you had into it?
* What if you had the guts to keep getting up, no matter how many times you were knocked down?
* What if you didn’t trick yourself into believing success was going to be easy, that there would be a few failures, and that you would be great without putting in the work?
* What if when someone critiqued you, you took the valid information and discarded the rest?
* What if instead of accepting criticism as someone saying you’re not good enough, you saw it as them saying you are still growing—saying you can get there?
* What if you took that as a challenge to keep learning and practicing? A challenge to keep improving yourself.
* What if you didn’t compare yourself to others, but instead compared your current self to your past?
* What if instead of just looking at how much you needed to improve you looked at how much you already have?
* What if, failure or not, you stood tall?
* What if you chose to be proud of what you’d accomplished, because you wholeheartedly followed your dream.

---

You choose whether to get back up and fight again or not to and how you look at yourself and your life is a big part of that. Will you be proud of what you’ve accomplished? Will you accept that the place you are in now is okay, and work to become who you want to be? Will you choose to be tougher than defeat and believe that you too can handle the brutal pursuit of a dream?

I recited my answer. ""I'd brake and try to swerve aside, hopefully into something soft.""

""That's what they all say,"" he said darkly. ""But if there really was a car bearing down on you, we'd find out how you'd really react.""

*Thanks, dude. I really needed to be even more nervous right now.*

I swallowed nervously as I slowed to a complete stop at a stop sign, turn signal ticking rhythmically.

I took a deep breath to calm my nerves. *You need this*, I told myself. *Once you can drive, you'll be able to take a delivery job. Then you'll be able to get some money to help Mom and Dad pay for college.*

*All you have to do is drive fifteen more minutes without breaking any laws.*

I glance in the rear-view mirror, turning my neck to indicate my conscientiousness of the importance of safety.

*That car should really be slowing-*

**SLAM.**

The car rocked forward with the impact.

*What the-*

""DRIVE!"" roared my instructor.

""Which way?"" I asked, panicked.

""DOESN'T MATTER JUST GO-""

I heard sudden pops and the shattering of glass.

*Gunshots?*

I slammed my foot onto the accelerator and my car reluctantly accelerated. There was a screeching noise, and I whirled the steering wheel and the car turned, the front right tire bouncing up over the curb.

My instructor turned around, drawing a gun from inside his jacket. I hadn't noticed it.

*I'm really glad that Mom didn't come with me on this.*

My instructor started shooting.

""Which way?"" I shouted over the sound of the car behind us catching up.

""GO FASTER!"" my instructor roared. ""JUST SHAKE THEM OFF!""

""The speed limit is 35!""

He didn't even respond. *Right.*

I push down harder on the accelerator.

I put my turn signal on and took a turn at a speed that would have made my little sister scream.

""Who are these people?!"" I asked. ""Why-""

""They're old business partners,"" my instructor commented.

Sure. *Business.*

""Oh, okay. That's perfectly NOT NORMAL WHAT DID YOU DO?!""

My instructor paused to reload.

""I may have made a few enemies when I left without completing an, um, a deal. I thought I'd covered my tracks.""

*Maybe this is what they do for driving tests. Maybe they want to make sure new drivers respond under pressure. Maybe they just swear us to secrecy and demand we tell everyone the hardest part was 'parallel parking'.*

Okay, so I was really grasping at straws. Give me a break. I was being shot at.

I left a strip of rubber behind as another hail of gunshots forced me to swing a risky left through an intersection. Horns blared as I narrowly avoided hitting an oncoming car and sandwiching my instructor.

I drove quickly down the road, glancing behind us in the mirror.

""... Did we lose them?"" I ask.

""Knowing them, no.""

Without warning, a pickup truck swerved out of oncoming traffic and roared towards us.

My eyes widened and for a second I froze. Then I wrenched the steering wheel and drove the car up through a bunch of carefully-trimmed bushes. I felt a scraping on the underside of the car as we careened through a crowded parking lot. I nearly hit someone's shopping cart, and frantically adjust the car's trajectory to send us across a less-than-busy road and into a side street.

I wiped some sweat from my face and, after taking a few more turns, parked the car in front of some poor suburbanite's home.

I just stared at my instructor for a few seconds.

"[WP] Humanity rose through the ranks of the Galactic Council faster than any species that came before them. Their secret? Science Fiction. Literature, movies, TV shows, video games pretty much made made anything thrown at humanity, predictable.",FallenHaribon,"""It's coming into view, Space Admiral.""

I took a look at the monitor, wondering if I could get ""Captain"" added to my title if I kept winning these battles. I'd chosen the title, in part, because the situation was so surreal (the other part was because I could, and because it's awesome). Two years ago, I was probably stretched out on my couch, re-watching Firefly for the umpteenth time and idly eating Cheetos. When the Galactic Council had revealed themselves to humanity, everything had changed. They'd been desperate. Between the Zorgblars and the Kingz of Da Universe, they'd been at a loss, trying to defend their worlds from being conquered. We'd been something of a last-ditch effort. Most alien species hadn't bothered with humanity. We didn't have any technology that others didn't have, and Earth isn't desirable for most alien species. Plus, after perusing the Internet, most were too weirded out to want to contact us. We were the interplanetary equivalent of animals at a zoo: interesting to look at, but not something you'd want to invite into your home.

Then we started winning. Sci-fi nerds could predict attacks and offer countermeasures (usually along with an ""It's like what happened in (some book)! I haven't read that book in ages! It was weird, but kinda good, y'know? You should read it! Once, you know, we, uh, don't die""). I'd been knowledgeable enough to come up with a plan for virtually everything they threw at us, because I'd spent most of my life reading and watching all things sci-fi.

And my 8th-grade math teacher said I'd never amount to anything.

There was silence in the control room as the Zorgblars' attack plan came into clear view on the monitor. ""Don't say it, "" someone said.

Silence. But I couldn't resist.

""That's no moon!""

The room exploded in laughter. We'd had to deal with some insane attack plans. I'd gotten to this position because I could always quickly dredge up some obscure, but relevant, sci-fi book or movie, and base an attack plan off of it. But Star Wars?

Honestly, it was almost insulting.

""Yeah, okay. Send in some small fighters, search for weak points,"" I said, still laughing. The massive attack sphere the Zorgblars had come up with was just too familiar.

The pilots rushed out of the room. I had to resist the urge to ask the ones named Luke to go in first.

"[wp] Strict new animal cruelty laws are enacted in Japan, plunging the real life Pokemon industry into chaos",LGBTLibrarian,"""When I grow up,"" my little brother declares, ""I'm going to be a Pokémon Master! Like Ash Ketchum.""

He runs across the room, throwing an imaginary Pokeball, adding plenty of sounds effects along the way.

My mom gives my father a worried look.

""Sweetie,"" my mom says. ""Er- don't you think...don't you think it's cruel to the Pokémon? To force them to fight all the time?""

""It's rubbish,"" Dad says. ""In my day, we had real Pokémon trainers. They pushed their Pokémon, to themselves, to the limit, every day. Lance? Agatha? Blaine? They were the strongest people we'd ever had. Besides, without Pokémon, we're sitting ducks! We'd have never won the Hoenn wars without them. Now it's 'cruel'! First it was the Frustration ban, then the Daycare Ditto scandal, and before you know, all we have are pets. Pets who, if used right, could have meant we never needed to worry about war again?""

""But dear, it's cruel,"" my mom says.

""What about bullfighting?"" my dad comments. ""What about-""

""We get the picture, Dad,"" I say. ""I'm heading out.""

""Studying with Lisa?"" my mom asks.

""Yeah,"" I say. If it ever comes up, Lisa will claim we were, in fact, studying.

***

""Hey,"" Lisa says. ""It's nice to see you.""

""You too,"" I say. ""What's up today?""

Lisa and I turn into an alley.

""Oh, nothing huge,"" Lisa says. ""But Big B is back in town.""

""He's back?"" Maybe I'll have a chance this time around.

We knock on an inconspicuous door, careful to rap once, then twice, then once, then three times.

The door opens slowly.

""Hey, Lis. Mike,"" Alf says, nodding at us. ""Party's downstairs.""

My parents would kill me if they could see me now.

When we emerge into the surprisingly large and well-soundproofed room, it's clear what the main attraction is. There's a small crowd gathered around an arena. Two Trainers, two Pokémon.

Brock stands, arm folded, as a bruised Charmander attempts to crawl out from beneath a pile of rocks. It almost stands for a second, then collapses.

Brock silently accepts a rather large sum of money from the dejected loser, who drags his Charmander over to Nurse Joy.

Yeah, I was surprised too.

Before there's too much commotion, I step up.

""I'd like to take you on.""

Brock nods. I've lost to him before. Many times before. But lately I've been doing a lot better. He doesn't laugh anymore when I challenge him.

""Sure. Onix isn't hurt.""

The guy with the Charmander glances up, glowering, then looks away when Brock meets his gaze.

""Good luck,"" Lisa says.

I've heard a lot about Pokémon cruelty. I've had my own twinges of conscience. But somehow, this is the moment I always seem to forget them.

""Go, Bellsprout!"" I yell. There's nothing quite as satisfying as throwing a Pokeball. I've been keeping as many as I can, because I'm sure they'll get more valuable. There are illegal versions, of course, but they're just not the same. I expect I'll make serious bank off of those someday.

We just face each other for a second.

""Let's go,"" Brock says.

""VINE WHIP!"" I try to get a move in before Brock is really ready, but he's too good a Trainer to start the fight before he really means it.

But he commands Onix to form a rock barrier to block himself off.

""Onix, harden!""

Oh, so he wants to play this game.

""Bellsprout, Leech Seed! Up and over the wall!""

I manage to seed the Onix, but Onix barrels out from behind the wall and rams into Bellsprout, sending her skidding across the floor.

""Bellsprout-"" I start to give a command, but Brock is already screaming ""Onix, Rock Tomb!""

Rocks tumble onto Bellsprout, and I see a crushed leaf sticking out of the pile.

The sight gives me pause. Maybe it's not right to do this. Maybe the Pokémon Cruelty Act is a good idea after all.

""You have another one?""

I pause. ""I-""

A canister of tear gas flies into the room.

A raid.

""POKÉMON DEFENCE!"" a voice yells. ""PUT YOUR HANDS ABOVE YOUR HEAD AND WALK INTO THE CENTER OF THE ROOM!""

My eyes are watering, and the tear gas is just getting started. Nurse Joy, I notice, is quickly...sinking? An underground tunnel?

A squadron of people in full suits, emblazoned with the letters P.D., rushes into the room.

I put my hands above my head.

""Brock,"" says one of the uniformed officers. ""I thought you'd moved on.""

Brock raises his hands above his head. To his credit, he does look a little ashamed.

One of the uniformed officers shoves me to the ground. I'm coughing, my eyes are streaming.

""You're being charged with second-degree Pokémon cruelty,"" the officer says. ""You'll be taken into custody and face charges. I'll be there to testify against you...monster.""

I cough, and wonder if there's any way I can keep this from my parents. The officer handcuffs me.

Bellsprout isn't faring too much better against the tear gas.

Today's a two-for-one special, you know. Six wishes. I bet Upon-A-Star™ doesn't offer those kinds of deals!""

I adjust my glasses. I've been prepared for this moment by the Internet since my youth.

""All right,"" I say. ""Let's talk ground rules.""

""Let's,"" replies the genie.

""Can I wish for infinite things?""

""Oh, this *will* be fun,"" he says. ""Unfortunately, I'm not even allowed to deal with infinities. In fact, any mention of the word 'infinity' in your wish will guarantee it gets marked as spam by our filters.""

""I wish for a finite, but arbitrarily large, amount of wishes.""

""Poof!"" he says.

Yes, he actually says ""Poof.""

""Congratulations! I've granted your wish. Since you didn't bother, I took the liberty of deciding the arbitrarily large number for you. I decided on one. One's a pretty large number, really! There are an uncountable amount of numbers less than one!""

I glower at him.

""I wish for two more wishes.""

""Poof! Congratulations, you have gained the incredible ability to wish for things. Two uses only, I'm afraid.""

I rack my brains.

""Look, kid,"" the genie says. ""Just give up. Just wish for something normal, like gold, or for the most popular girl in school to be your girlfriend or something like that.""

I am not about to give up this battle of wits without a fight, though.

""I wish for ten more genies!""

""Poof!"" Ten more genies flicker into existence.

""Congratulations! You've contributed to the continued survival of genies! We're an endangered species, you know, ever since Aladdin came out and people stopped wishing themselves into genies. You will forever be remembered as a benefactor of our kind.""

For a moment a golden statue of me appears, grinning and giving the thumbs-up. The genies all pretend to shed a tear.

""Of course,"" the first genie says, ""you must realize that wishes are granted on a per-person basis, not per-person-per-genie. Four wishes left.""

I groan in frustration.

""I wish for someone who will be willing to wish for anything I tell them to wish for.""

""Poof! Congratulations! You fit that category splendidly yourself! *The person you wanted was **you** all along!* Three wishes left.""

I stomp my foot in frustration.

""I wish for someone *else* with all of those qualities, who is also eligible for receiving wishes,"" I say, hoping to close another loophole.

""Poof!"" An impressionable young boy appears.

""Hello,"" I say. ""What's your name?""

""Marvin,"" he says. He looks nervous, and starts sucking his thumb.

Feeling creepier by the second, I say, ""Marvin, could you please tell this genie here that you wish that I become the ruler of the world?""

It was kind of impulsive. I'm not I even *wanted* to be the ruler of the world. But I couldn't stand the look on the genies face.

""I wish I was the ruler of the world!"" Marvin says obediently.

""Poof! Congratulations! This boy's height is now an SI unit! You have three wishes left, and this boy has five.""

""I wish Star Wars was real!"" Marvin says.

""Poof! Congratulations! Star Wars did indeed happen! In a galaxy far, far away, of course. And a long time ago. Couldn't be breaching canon, could we? Four wishes for the little one left.""

Marvin looks extremely disappointed.

""Look, kid. Just give up. Give in to your teenage fantasies. Maybe with some of my help, you might actually have a date for prom.""

Low blow.

""I wish genies were incapable of subtraction,"" I say.

The other genies, who had been looking bored, roll their eyes.

""Poof! Congratulations! Genies are no longer capable of subtraction. We are, however, perfectly capable of adding negative numbers.""

""THAT'S THE SAME THING!"" I yell indignantly.

""Different enough,"" he says.

""Didn't you say something about your filters, and something that made it sound like you guys were a company?""

""Yes!"" he replies. ""GenieCorp is a proud provider of all wishes to young and o-""

""Yeah, whatever,"" I say. ""How about I talk to customer service?""

""Oh, sure,"" he says. A phone appears in his hand.

""Hello?"" he asks in a voice that is clearly meant to mock my own. I definitely do not sound that high-pitched. ""Hi, I'm calling because I want to abuse your product line and make a mockery of your company? Yes. That's correct. Yes, I'm doing it purely because I think I'm smarter than everyone else- huh,"" he says, turning to me. ""Seems like they hung up.""

I grit my teeth.

""Marvin, could you kindly repeat what I'm about to say to the genie? 'I wish for one million dollars, to be given immediately and safely to the human nearest to me.'""

""Poof! *Finally*"", says the genie, and presents me with a large stack of bills. ""That's better. Less of this too-cool-for-school stuff, more giving into your greed and baser qualities. One for you, three for the lad.""

I didn't want to think about his comment about greed too much.

""Well,"" I say. ""I think I've won.Marvin, say 'I wish for someone who is eligible for six wishes and hasn't used any of those wishes yet who is willing to wish for whatever I ask them.""

Marvin obliges.

""You're getting pretty creepy,"" commented the genie. ""Unfortunately, there are no valid people like that.""

""What?"" I ask.

""Since you pulled that stunt with poor Marvin here, the rules were quickly revised. As long as anyone has wishes left, nobody else is eligible for wishes. One for you, two for him.""

""But you didn't grant the wish!""

""We at GenieCorp endeavor to do our best to provide top-notch wish service. However, in the event that a wish is impossible to grant, we do not have a refund policy.""

""Outrageous,"" I mutter. ""Marvin, say to the genie 'I wish that the human closest to me had complete jurisdiction over GenieCorp policy.""

Marvin dutifully repeats the phrase.

""Sorry! The wish hardware makes meddling with anything in its own internal working via wish impossible.""

""But that doesn't even make sense!""

""One wish left for each of you.""

""All right,"" I say. ""Two left. Might as well make sure I get something more than money out of this before trying to cheat the system again. Marvin, tell the genie 'I wish that Lita from the human nearest to me's chemistry class liked him.' Also, take this.""

I hand him half of the million dollars, in a vain attempt to assuage my conscience.

""Wow,"" said the genie. ""I feel like there's a lesson to be learned from this. Something about mankind's weaknesses. Or maybe about not trusting it to people who don't even have their fly up.""

I glance down, and hastily zip it up.

""Well?"" I demand.

""Poof!"" the genie says. ""She did indeed like you, but she's over that now. One wish left.""

""THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT AND YOU KNOW IT!""

""You should thank me,"" said the genie. ""Or, maybe, the rest of humanity should.""

I reach into my pocket and withdraw my phone.

""What are you doing now?""

I glare at the genie. ""Time to put this half a million to use. I need to have a request without loopholes. I'm calling a lawyer.""",LethargicPilgrim

[WP] A small girl which travels the world known as the Iron Owl.,Your_Dogs_Cat,"Zetta was eleven years old and a little under five feet tall, but when she walked down a busy sidewalk, people moved. She wasn't a particularly intimidating-looking girl under the mask, but between the bullet-gray suit covering her body and the news reports, she had quite a presence.

The busy sidewalk parted and quieted as she passed, at least until a kid ran up to her. The boy was young, but he couldn't have been much younger than her.

""Can- can I, um, have your autograph?""

Zetta eyed the youngster, who was holding out a pen and a notecard. Maybe he'd just come from school. Mentally, she thought of the kid as being much younger than she was. Maybe that was arrogant. *Or maybe*, she thought, *it's justified*.

Zetta loved her image when it came to combat. But she always felt disappointed when the news made her seem so scary. It wasn't like she expected to be some kind of Superman figure to the public. She knew she'd given that up after her brother had been killed. But she wasn't about to start attacking civilians.

""Sure,"" she said, in an attempt to make her voice sound kind. She wasn't used to it. She was all too aware of the boy's slight trembling as she signed the notecard.

*Iron Owl.*

The boy hurried back to his mother, who looked terrified.

*What, did she think I was going to eat him or something?*

Zetta continued walking. Apparently nobody else wanted an autograph, or had the guts to ask for it.

***

Zetta heard the sound of sirens.

""Owl Eyes,"" Zetta said.

""I'm here.""

Zetta never called her sister by name when they were communicating like this. Their connection was encrypted, but you could never be too careful. Gertrude liked the code name 'Owl Eyes' for some reason. Probably from some book she'd read.

""Get me the details. What are we dealing with?""

""Cops busted a drug deal. One guy ran for it. Well, drove for it. It's the black car on your feed. They're approaching you.""

Zetta glanced at the feed Gertrude was sending her, a video of a street nearby. Presumably from a security camera. She wondered how Gertrude had access to them. 

She stood up from her spot on a bench. The people around her, who had been glancing at her periodically, openly stared.

""I advise you to take cover,"" she announced, pressing the button embedded into her suit's fingers to amplify her voice. ""Stay away from the street. There could be a fight, and I don't want any of you hurt. But it shouldn't come to that.""

The people around her, wide-eyed, moved behind nearby buildings and ducked into shops.

Zetta rushed forward, and the suit sprung into action, each step pushing her further, each step carefully managed by the suit's computer to keep her balanced while the suit's feet added the necessary power. It was an incredible invention, really. It had taken her sister's professor twenty years to design and build the suits, keeping them carefully under wraps the whole time.  He'd left them to her sister, telling her to make sure it was used. He knew Gertrude couldn't use the suits herself. Gertrude hadn't had legs since birth.

He hadn't want his work to be forgotten. Zetta understood that. What she didn't understand was why he had never wanted it traced back to him, or why he'd given the suits to her sister when he knew she couldn't use them. Her sister had said that he didn't want his legacy to be this. Zetta wondered if her sister's professor would have been proud of her.

*He would've been proud of Cody*, she thought. *Me? I don't know. Maybe he'd be horrified. Maybe this is what he was afraid of.*

She paused in the middle of the road, turning to the car.

*Or maybe this is what he was too afraid to admit he wanted.*

Zetta held up a hand. She always gave them a chance. Cody had always insisted on giving criminals a chance to come quietly. As far as she was concerned, that was one of the two things that put her above them.

""Load a jump to the side,"" she said.

""Already done,"" Gertrude responded almost instantly.

The car was getting closer. It didn't seem to be slowing down. She waited, then when the car was too close for comfort, clicked the glove-button for 'Execute [1]'.

The suit took over, shifting her legs and propelling her out of the way of the car.

""Blast loaded on two!"" Gertrude offered.

""Thanks,"" Zetta said, landing on her feet and turning to give chase. She aimed at the car, and clicked 'Execute [2]'. Her arm moved down towards one of the car's tires, by the suit's command. There was a small explosive noise, and the car began screeching. Zetta wasn't exactly sure what had happened, but something had shot out of the suit's arm and destroyed one of the car's tires. Probably one of Gertrude's new additions.

Zetta caught up with the car in seconds. It was still going, but it was slower now. She ran alongside the driver. He turned and stared at her in shock.

Zetta punched through the driver's window. He screamed, showered in glass, and Zetta's armored hand got a grip on the door. She tore it off. She was still running, and just let it drop behind her. The police were getting closer. She reached into the car and grabbed the man. 

""Calibrate jump into the car, on one,"" Zetta barked. ""Which one is the brake pedal again?"" 

She pulled the man out of the car. They were getting uncomfortably close to an intersection. The man shrieked as she let him drop. They were still travelling at least twenty miles an hour.

The man would survive, Zetta was almost sure. He'd have to be really unlucky not to. Zetta didn't kill. But she wasn't gentle, either. They'd been gentle when Cody died. They'd given a criminal an opportunity to jam a gun into a weak point in Cody's armor and shoot. The man had tried to escape.

Before that night, they were just called the Owls. 'Iron' had been added shortly after the police had found her brother's murderer, bloody, likely to never walk again, on the steps of the station.

""The wide one, in the middle. Loaded.""

Zetta pressed 'Execute [1]'. The suit kicked off the ground and she flew into the front of the car, bracing herself against the steering wheel.

She slammed her foot into the brake pedal, and the car screeched to a halt, stopping before it entered the intersection.

""Okay,"" said Gertrude. ""Now park it.""

""...How?""

""Lever in the middle. Press the button on the side, then move the lever to 'P'.""

Zetta managed to park the car, then hopped out of the space where the front door used to be.

The police had caught up to the former driver. He was scraped up and bloody. Groaning, but alive. He was standing up now.

""I've had enough of Chicago,"" Zetta said. ""Let's go somewhere else.""

""Sure. I've heard there's been a crime wave in New York.""

Zetta wondered how long she'd be doing this. How long would she stay like this, fighting crime, slowly getting older?

*As long as I can*, she thought. ""New York sounds lovely.""",LethargicPilgrim

This fight? It's a big deal, but it's not *that* big of a deal. Big enough of a deal for the Vice President, but I don't get the Big P himself present at my fight. After all, this is just a simple tariff disagreement. Nothing like a territorial dispute or anything.

Walk in, give them a winning smile. Don't hem and haw so much. You're always hemming and hawing.""

I've been enduring a steady stream of Rachel's advice for hours, and I'm almost glad I'm about to get to leave. Even if the fate of humanity does hang in the balance.

The door opens. A greenish squidlike thing that slowly changes colors waits for me. A mechanical voice from an orange device it holds announces.

""WELCOME CHOSEN HUMAN REPRESENTATIVE. PLEASE FOLLOW ME AND I WILL GUIDE YOU TO THE ELDER'S ROOM.""

""andmakesureyourpostureisgoodstandstraightupbeconfidentbutnotarrogant—""

The door slides closed behind me, and the squid-thing oozes forward. I smile a little. For all of Rachel's micromanagement, it's not her walking in to argue for humanity's existence. It's me.

I feel a surge of pride that probably isn't a good indication of humanity's future.

It's weird, being led down this hall. I'm nervous, of course. Extremely nervous. But my nerves don't correspond to the gravity of the situation. I've never been this nervous, but I *have* been nearly this nervous when I was giving my eighth grade science presentation. This is orders of magnitude more significant, and my brain just can't muster the appropriate level of stress.

Another door opens. The squid thing stands to the side.

""PLEASE ENTER.""

I walk into the room. It's extremely intimidating, but after a few moment's I start to feel some of my nausea fading. Not that it's less stressful, but the moment is here.

*Just this left now*, I think. *No more preparation, no more Rachel. Just my brain in between the most advanced weapons I know of and the human race*.

*How comforting*.

I straighten my back, and look at the elders. They look like bigger squid things. They're pretty ugly.

*Don't even think that. They are wonderful. They are your audience. You'd better deliver*.

""Hello,"" I say.

""HELLO. YOU ARE FREE TO BEGIN. YOU MAY ASK US QUESTIONS AT ANY TIME, BUT THE TIMER WILL CONTINUE DURING THAT TIME.""

""So,"" I say. I can almost hear Rachel screaming. *""SO! YOU STARTED YOUR PITCH WITH 'SO'?""*

""Humans,"" I say. ""It may not look like it, but we've done some pretty cool stuff. We built the pyramids— and that was when we were just getting started as a species!""

""WE ARE AWARE. WE BUILT THEM.""

Welp, that was awkward.

*Sorry, guys*, I think. *But in my defense, maybe humanity isn't so great after all. Maybe the universe really needs more squid things.*

""Um,"" I say. I hear Rachel screaming at me in my head again. ""Um, well, we made the Internet.""

""WE TOO INVENTED RAPID COMMUNICATION. IT QUICKLY ALLOWED OUR SPECIES TO EXCHANGE SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION. WE THEN DEVELOPED OUR NEW TECHNOLOGY AFTER A FEW YEARS. WE HAVE NOT SEEN ADVANCED SPACE OR WEAPONRY TECHNOLOGY FROM YOU. WHAT TECHNOLOGY HAVE YOU USED YOUR 'INTERNET' TO DEVELOP?""

""Um,"" I say. ""Um, well, I think we use it for communication between our researchers.""

""THIS IS NOT PARTICULARLY IMPRESSIVE.""

""Um,"" I say. ""Well, we're pretty good at developing weapons technology. If we had access to your science, I'm sure we could—""

""WE ARE NOT INTERESTED IN GIVING OUR SECRETS TO SUCH A VOLATILE SPECIES.""

Fair point, but ouch.

I desperately try to remember ideas I've been brainstorming for weeks.

""We have artists,"" I say. ""Artists who can create incredible—""

""WE ARE NOT INTERESTED IN YOUR 'ART'.""

""We have beer?""

""OUR RACE IS NOT CAPABLE OF EXPERIENCING PLEASURE.""

*What?*

""Um,"" I say. I'd sort of been relying on the pleasure thing for many of my backup answers.

""Humans are interesting! We do weird things, we're hard to predict. I'm sure you would be interested in observing us.""

""WE DO NOT WANT TO LEARN FROM SUCH A SPECIES.""

I try to continue thinking of arguments, but I've developed something of a mental fixation on beer. Classic. Humanity will be doomed because I couldn't get a mental grip on things.

""We could serve you guys,"" I suggested. ""Humans are pretty good at pampering.""

""WE HAVE ROBOTS TO TAKE OF THE NECESSARY NEEDS.""

Man, I couldn't even sell us into slavery? That had been my last resort.

I guess I was relieved in a way, though. That would've been depressing.

""Um,"" I say. ""Um.""

The elders are silent for a bit as I try to gather my thoughts.

""IF YOU HAVE NOTHING LEFT TO SAY—""

""Warfare!"" I gasp.

""WE HAVE ALREADY DISCUSSED IT.""

""No,"" I say. ""We can be used as weapons. You guys have all the weapons *now*, sure. But sometime someone's going to start developing things that can compete. We can be your backup plan. Say what you will about humanity, but we *survive*. If your enemies start developing shields that work against your weapons, just send some of us in. We'll start taking their resources, trying to make our own way there. Sure, they might kill the colony. But all the stuff we've just talked about? It's proof that, as a species, we mess things up. We mess *everything* up. Make use of that. Let humanity be another weapon in your arsenal.""

The elders consider my statement.

"[WP] There are superpowers, but there are also superinabilities.",Telaxius,"Today's the day. My parents eagerly await for me at the kitchen table. My dad was easily one of the most powerful people I could even imagine. His power of telepathy had advanced in time to the point where he could breakdown anything to a molecular level and rearrange it into another item. My mom on the other hand was a healer. Never had a broken bone because of her. The only thing she could heal or fix was herself. 
   ""Son, I know that puberty is a scary thought. Your body is gonna change, and you aren't sure if it'll be for the better, or the worse. All we can say is, you're our son no matter what happens and we'll always love you and be proud of who you are,"" my father told me in his loving dad voice. I just gave a half smile as I ate my runny eggs with toast. He placed a small box in front of me, ""Don't tell your friends I got you this."" I was confused and opened the box swiftly. There it was, a power zapper. Only 5 of these existed and this one belonged to an inable that had made it so he could kill the powerful. I was in awe of this gift. My dad had taken this guy down almost 5 years ago and told everyone he destroyed the mans work. Then it hit me; did my own father think I was going to be inable? Why give me something so important? Did it even work? Before I could even say anything my father told me,
   ""It may only have a couple shots left. Hasn't been charged in years after all. This will take away someone's powers for an entire week. What you do with it is your own choice. Personally i'd get back at that one friend of yours with the smart mouth, but that's not what i'm telling you to do."" I laughed and tucked it away, ""Dad, I may be evil for a teenager, but that's just to you guys."" We both shared a laughed and I was off to school. I had tucked the zapper into my backpack and couldn't wait to catch someone off guard. Some people develop powers that later turn to inabilities. Like Zack's mom who had the power of super speed but now was confined to a wheel chair. Maybe if I caught one of the flyer I could get a good laugh at them trying to lift off. Charlie saw my looking at something in my bag and quickly snatched it from my hand.
   ""What, you a mad scientist now?"" He asked looking at the zapper. We both knew what it was after the first terrorist use of it. Although they didn't ban them since the only others were in government control. 
   ""No, I found this thing,"" I lied covering up the fact that my dad gave it to me.
   ""What's a matter birthday boy? Afraid you won't get powerful?"" Charlie ask playfully. I just gave a sigh a looked away from him. ""Look man, you're gonna be super powerful. I just know it. Don't sweat it now, that's for when you're learning your new power. You don't need a zapper to be powerful,"" Zack always knew exactly what to say to cheer me up. I put the zapper in my bag, ""You're right. I don't need this thing. I don't know why I even brought it,"" I told him as we arrived at school. At first period we all partnered up for gym, my least favorite part of my day. I get to be in a class full of powers and watch them do extraordinary things. While I sit on the bench waiting for my powers to come in. For some reason I couldn't stop thinking about the zapper that was now safely in my locker. The idea of taking someone's power made me almost sweat with anticipation of using it. I couldn't even describe the feeling I got next. One of the super strength student had chucked a discus at what the coach said was easily 250 MPH. When I realized what was happening I thought of the discus hitting a wall. I closed my eyes and flinched hard trying to brace myself for my death. I heard a loud crash and the sound of cement crumbling. I looked up from my cowardice to see a 10 foot wall standing in front of me with the discus lodged in the center. Everyone looked in awe. No one else has ever been able to just manifest things at will like that before. All I knew, was that I was safe, scared, and plain confused.",HueyLewisIsASquare

   ""What's the matter, kid? Don't believe your eyes?"" The woman said standing up. It was an old family friend, I even called her Auntie. Her real name was Vanessa. I wasn't sure why I hadn't seen her since I was maybe six years old.
   ""You sure look like your dad more and more,"" She said almostly lovingly. ""He was always the best eye candy in this hideous company of mostly men."" Okay, now I was getting uncomfortable. 
   ""Sorry, i've been helping myself to the bar a little frequently lately so i'm a tad honest,"" she apologized and hugged me like she use to when she'd visit the house with my dad. 
   ""So this is the patrol headquarters?"" I asked her looking in awe at all the scenery still. 
   ""Very observant, young man,"" she winked mockingly opening her arms in a showing gesture. Vanessa waved me over toward the front door of the compound. There in front of the steel door was what looked like a yearbook collection of photos. 
   ""This was the patrol for the last 20 years. The black and white photos are inactive members. We haven't had a new recruit since the inception,"" All but 4 pictures were black and white. There was Vanessa, a fridge of a man named Nate, a nerdy looking dude name Garret, and a girl that didn't have a name listed. Of course my father was apart of the blacked out pictures, but then surprisingly enough my mother was on the board. 
   ""Why did she never mention being on the patrol?"" I barely got through the question I was so lost.
   ""The healer? Yeah she was in the patrol. Barely,"" she explained. ""She lasted a few years before your father and her got so buddy buddy,"" She had a sour look on her face. ""She then stepped down to live a more normal life, while leaving him in even more danger without a healer. So she could start their family. So she could raise you!"" She yelled through clenched teeth. I slowly backed away, unsure of her powers I needed to make sure she wouldn't turn this anger onto me. ""No need to worry,"" she smiled softly again looking at me. ""The high ups have big plans for you, and how could I hurt that pretty face of yours?"" Vanessa chuckled and walked off. ""You'll be meeting the others later today in the courtyard.

I stood there shaking, I felt so faint. I felt the wall, three feet thick concrete. Out of thin air this appeared. Was my power restricted to concrete? What else could I conjure? 
   ""You're coming with me immediately!"" Coach ripped me away from the wall and dragged me toward the principal's office. He was pulling me like a dead body. Why aren't my legs working? The last thing I remember was the door slamming open as we got to the office. Next thing I knew I was in a hospital bed with an IV drip. Yet, I wasn't in a hospital. I was still in the principal's office. Surrounded by faculty and strange uniformed soldiers. I start trying to ask what was going on, but I had some sort of gag in my mouth. I struggled realizing I was strapped to the bed. The soldiers held me down as the principal walked up to the bed.
   ""Now, now. Don't be scared,"" His tone of voice still terrified me. ""We strapped you down for your own safety as well as the gag. You seem to have one of the most physically demanding powers we've ever seen,"" His eyes seemed to swell with joy in telling me this. ""You made something out of thin air! If you don't see the amazing potential in this, i'll be happy to inform you,"" The principal said turning away from me. ""We are going to train you. Not the normal gym training we do for powers. No. You get the special treatment. The kind of training your dad went through before he left the patrol,"" that statement alone made me wish I would've been hit with that discus in class. My father told me of his training when he'd been drinking. 
   ""I wouldn't wish that hell on anyone,"" he'd say sloshing his bourbon around gesticulating. ""It was the patrol. Powerful hunting powerful. A task force to police powerful persons and protect the inables. Most powerful don't use their power as more than a parlor trick. The ones we hunted. They were sick murderous monsters. I barely feel comfortable calling them people,"" His drunken ramblings seemed like fairy tales. That is, until now. 
   ""We've contacted your parents,"" The principal explained, ""they will arrive to the school soon to either the news of you transferring to a private class, or to your untimely death due to 'power exhaustion'. The choice is yours."" 
They removed the gag from my mouth and sat in silence for 2 minutes waiting for me to respond. All I could muster was laughter in their faces. As I saw one of the teacher prepping a needle I instantly went gray. 
   ""Okay! I'll go with you!"" I shouted. The principal chuckled and snapped his fingers to halt the prep. ""That is if my dad will let you."" I gave a grin, thinking I had won. When my parents walked in the door my stomach sank. It was like slow motion. One of the soldiers sitting by the door held out a power zapper and shot both of my parents with it.
   ""What's happening?"" they shouted as the principal drew an energy blade from his hands. It was a katana made of blue energy. I'll never forget that blade as he swung down through my father's shoulder into his chest. My mother left in tears and incapable of healing him.

I feared for smoothies and blended meals all while sitting on the sidelines watching others fly, run super fast, turn invisible, and even lift impossibly heavy objects. Would my life be confined to the ground and to some odd inability to do what seemed to be a normal function? My buddy Lenny grew into a super shout, discovered of course while playing video games. Then there was Charlie, who learned he could levitate when we were all on the trampoline one day. Even Zack who we all bet wouldn't get powers can lift things with his thoughts.

   ""Nah teleporting seems more his thing,"" Zack responded.

   ""Don't take them both from me!"" She cried over and over as the principal retracted his blade. 
   ""We have a healer that could save him. If you sign away your son to this new program,"" the coach gave an ultimatum. My mother stared at me, tears running down her cheeks. I knew what I had to do. I simply nodded to her. We both knew he needed to be around. She signed the papers, dripping my father's blood over each signature. 
   ""We would've taken the boy either way. Now we don't have to kill you as well,"" Coach said smugly as he signaled the healer over. ""You'll have to get him home ma'am. He'll be dead tired,"" he laughed at his lame joke. As my mom picked my now unconscious father's body, I couldn't help feel as if i'd never see them again.

Not even a goodbye. They didn't let us exchange words. It was simply stated that she was to pick up my father and leave. A soldier shot a syringe into my IV drip. Whatever it was, it was heavy duty. I woke up 36 hours later, or so i'm told. This time I wasn't tied up at all when I woke up. I was resting comfortably in a bed bigger than a king. Now, this was a great change in pace, but I couldn't shake an uneasy feeling. I promptly got dressed in my clothes sitting next to the bed. Sneaking out of the room to be safe, I decided to look around more. This place was a goddamn mansion. It was palatial in size. There was an outdoor and indoor pool. Furniture straight from the 70's. It looks like they've had this patrol for a long time. Why would my dad leave this? I feel like the king here.

I saw myself, sitting in a chair. That was wrong. I was standing. My inner ears turned and I felt sick. The my seated self was bloodied up. My hands were bound and my face was beaten and caked in peeling scabs. I was knocked out. I tried to look around but I was immobile. I drank my morning coffee with my wife. 

""Did you sleep well?"" she asked.

My mouth began to form the word 'yes' instinctively. I stopped myself. ""No. I actually had a really awful dream.""

""What was it about?"" She leaned forward, placing both elbows on the table and grabbing my coffee-free hand in hers.

""I was in two places. On one... side, I guess, of the room I was fine but I couldn't move. The other me was tied to a chair and covered in blood.""

""Hmm...""

""Yeah."" I took a sip of coffee. My tongue stung. I should've let it cool.

""Work stress? Like you feel you have to be in too many places at once?""

I shrugged. ""Not sure. Freaked me out though.""

Work was slow as always. Staff meeting in the morning (it was my turn to buy the donuts; I forgot) followed by six hours of mindless cubicle work. I spent the whole day filling out my backlog of requisition forms to transfer mortgage over-charge fees into venture capital, a process that, outside of my small part in it, was basically magic from my perspective. At hour four my floor manager stopped by, stereotypically oversized coffee thermos in hand.

""How go the form 784s, Malcolm?""

I looked up. It took my eyes a few seconds to adjust from computer sight to people sight. ""I'm working on 321s right now.""

""I thought we agreed today that non-profits were the priority.""

""There are no non-profits in my backlog. Jake handles those.""

""Fat Jake or skinny Jake?""

""Yes.""

He patted me on the back and took a swig from his massive thermos. ""Keep up the good work, pal."" He walked off, presumably toward the Jakes. I'm not sure what I had said during that whole conversation.

I closed my eyes and breathed for a while before returning to my forms. The cubicle was uncharacteristically hot. I unbuttoned my sleeves and rolled them up. My right wrist was wrong, but I couldn't tell why. It nagged at me the rest of the day.

I rode home on the tram. I stared at my wrist. Where was the burn scar I'd gotten at my first fast food job? I felt sweat drip down my back. Something was wrong. I went into the bathroom of my apartment and stripped down to my boxers in front of the mirror.

My scars were gone. All of them. In addition, I was thinner than I had remembered. I rushed out. ""Janet!""

""Yeah?"" She was sitting in front of the TV.

""There's something wrong with me.""

""Yeah, I would say so."" She snickered. ""You don't normally run around the house mostly naked. Something have you extra excited today?""

""No, look at me.""

""What am I supposed to see?""

""I don't have any scars."" She shrugged. My jaw dropped. ""Seriously? You don't find that weird?""

""Did you ever have any?""

""Yes!""

Shrugged again. ""Maybe they just went away.""

""Scars don't just vanish overnight!""

""Malcolm,"" She stood up and grabbed my hands. ""You need to just relax. There's a perfectly normal explanation for this.""

I leaned my head on her shoulder. Breathing slowly, I rested. ""Okay. Okay, you're right. I need some fresh air."" I released her hands and headed to the bathroom. I put my clothes back on and walked out. ""I'm going for a walk.""

""Okay. When you get back I thought we could go out to eat tonight. Where do you want to go?""

""I could go for sushi."" I left the apartment.

The elevator ride down all twenty-two floors took forever. A thump came from the top of the elevator car. It must have needed maintenance. 321s and 784s were on my mind. I wasn't even really sure what those forms were anymore; rote processes that became routine, dull; did they matter? What was the point of my job? I had nothing to spend money on. Janet's career paid for more than enough to cover all of our expenses. Who cared if I converted mortgage thingies into capital thingies if...

I got off the elevator and exited through the apartment lobby's automatic glass doors. The air pressure change outdoors versus indoors hurt my eyes and sinuses. Streets on this side of town did not get the cleaning they needed. I hate trash. I wandered northward with my hands shoved in my pockets thinking to myself that the air out here was not nearly as fresh as I had wanted. Smog, especially of the nuclear variety, was pretty common these days. New Detroit, a lot of people claimed, was going the way of old Detroit fast. I didn't believe that. We didn't have near enough cars.

An old homeless man and a robot sat at the edge of the sidewalk in front of an ATM. The old guy had a drum, the robot a bass guitar. They played smooth jazz, lacking in depth without a piano and brass instruments. I stood around with a small crowd that listened to them as they played. The song ended, clapping. The crowd began to disperse, tossing credit blocks and old world coins into the guitar case.

""Been playing for long?"" I asked as I fished my wallet out of my pocket.

""My whole life,"" said the robot.

""How long has that been?""

""Two years.""

""Ahh."" I tossed in the smallest credit block I had. ""You sound pretty good for two years.""

""Thank you."" He motioned toward his friend. ""He thanks you too for your donation. All proceeds go toward food and maintenance.""

""Not booze?""

""That was very rude.""

""I'm sorry. You're right."" I tossed in another, larger credit block. Thinking before I spoke had always been an issue. ""Best of luck to the two of you."" The old man winked at me.",CyberPunkButNotAPunk

"[WP] In the future, there's a serial killer that has never been discovered: He clones his victims before he abducts them, leaving the clones in their place (memories intact) and kills the originals.",salazarb,"I headed back to the apartment building. The automatic doors didn't open. I looked up at the scanner. It was on, the red light was blinking. I jumped up and down and waved at it. Nothing. I knocked on the glass. The lobby attendant came over and opened it for me.

""Sorry, Malcolm,"" he said, ""I'm not sure why it didn't recognize you. I'll get the manager to take a look at it.""

I thanked him and headed to the elevator. There was the thumping again. Abruptly, on floor eleven, the elevator screeched to a halt. It was stuck in between floors. My claustrophobia started to get to me. I pressed the 'call' and 'emergency' buttons a few times. Nothing happened. I pried the doors open with my hands and crawled up and out. I flopped out onto the eleventh floor and gasped for air. 

After a few minutes I stood up and dusted myself off. I turned around to get a look at the elevator. I think everyone heard my shrill scream.

""So how did you find your twin's body?""

""I told you, I don't have a twin."" The policeman sitting behind the glass panel at the all clinically white, sickly station refused to understand what I was saying.

""Mm hmm."" He nodded with his lips mounted on the edge of a mug of cocoa. A had the strong urge to reach through the glass and wipe away the melting-marshmallow foam on his bushy black mustache. ""So where did you find the corpse?""

""I already told you.""

""Right. I have it all written down in my notes.""

""Aren't you wondering why he looks like me?""

""Twin.""

""I told you I don't have a twin.""

""Right."" He stood up. ""I'll go file some paperwork. Stay here.""

I was handcuffed to the counter. I looked around. Every other booth was occupied by someone pleading their case or testifying about some crime, maybe a traffic violation. The police officer of the booth next to mine had left as well. The teenager sitting there was in the same position I was: unheard.

""So,"" I said to him, ""What are you here for?""

""Drugs.""

""Ahh. Doing or selling?""

""Little of both."" He flipped back his long bangs so he could see who he was talking to. ""How 'bout you?""

""I found my own corpse.""

He stopped talking to me at that point. I was tapped on the shoulder. I turned around. A man in a trench coat with an unlit cigarette in his mouth towered over me.

""Did I hear you say something about finding your own body?""

""Yes.""

He put out his hand. ""I'm Detective Darfelled. And you?""

""Malcolm Brink. I'd shake your hand, but..."" I displayed my handcuffs. He patted himself down for a key. He found nothing. Whipping out his sidearm, he shot the chain apart. The entire police station got silent except for a few screams of terror. Quickly, though, everyone there returned to what they had been doing.

""Follow me, Malcolm Brink.""

The burger bar was packed with hungry people having dinner. Had Janet gotten sushi? Grease coated the air, as did painfully load conversation that had to work to rival the overly rambunctious 2020s rock tunes. I hated oldies. Darfelled seemed to love them. He'd bought me a burger. I picked at it while he scarfed down his, getting catsup on his trench coat and tie. With a lick of his thumb he signaled his satisfaction.

""So,"" he said, shouting covertly, conspiratorially, over the noise, ""it must have been quite a shock finding your own body.""

""Yes. It was.""

""So you're obviously a clone.""

I hadn't considered that. ""What? Why do you think that?""

""Well, do you have any scars or distinguishing marks.""

""No.""

""Drats. We can't really check then.""

""No, I mean I did but they disappeared today.""

""Ah, okay. So, yeah. You're a clone.""

I put my head in my hands and stared at the table. I had a brief existential crisis. ""Oh, God. I'm really dead.""

""Hey, cheer up, bud. You're alive.""

""How can you say that? My real body is dead and I'm just a copy.""

""Well, you know, it's not really that bad. It's still you in that skull after all, right?"" He tapped my forehead with a greasy index finger. ""So you aren't totally dead.""

""But I am.""

""Wow. You sure are a downer, aren't you.""

""You wouldn't be upset if this happened to you?""

""Well, it already did.""

I looked up at him. ""What?""

A big, stupid looking grin stretched itself across his face. ""Yeah, I've been investigating these serial killings ever since I lost my first body.""

""Serial killings?""

""Yeah, you know. A string of murders where the target and modus...""

""I know what serial killings are. I'm asking because you're talking as though this is common.""

""Very common. The guy... or gal, I guess, don't want to be sexist... is really good. Takes a hair or skin sample, grows a clone in an enhanced aging vat,"" The hollow mirror, ""and then replaces the victim with the clone. We probably won't ever catch 'em. Even if we did, can't charge 'em.""

I leaned back in the booth, resting my head against the plastic cushion. The ceiling was covered in vinyl records and C.D.s, old school music formats nailed to an otherwise boring ceiling. I felt like one of those C.D.s; ripped and copied, placed on a new disk for distribution. I looked back at Darfelled.

""Why couldn't you charge them?"" I asked.

""Well, it has to do with the way we define murder. Homicide requires the destruction of life, right? But the way we define it it needs to be of a mind as well as a body. Well, a body gets killed but you,"" He pointed at me. ""still have a mind. Therefore, you are still alive and no homicide has been committed. It's the same as those people who upload their consciousnesses into computers. Their body dies, but hey, the doctor's don't get charged.""

""But that's stupid!""

""Why?""

""Because my body is physically dead! I saw my own corpse! I died, and someone killed me!""

""So?""

""So it's murder!""

""No. It's consciousness transfer.""

""What about my soul?""

""Pretty much every legal religion has recognized that clones have souls. Why, worried you can't get into the afterlife, reincarnation or something?""

""I'm not religious.""

""Then what's the problem?""

I walked home. The cops almost arrested me for leaving before my paperwork was done but Darfelled vouched for me. They arrested him instead. The robot and the old man were in the hallway of my apartment when I got back. They watched me. I ignored them as I opened the door. It was late. Janet was asleep. An eggroll was sitting out on a plate on the table for me. I put it in the fridge.

In the bedroom, I watched Janet breathe peacefully, silently, for a while. I wasn't the man she'd married. He was dead. I was his shadow, but what had he really done with my life anyway? Nothing exciting, that's for sure. I guess I didn't really owe him anything. He didn't deserve my pity. My life was mine, even if it had just started. I got into the pajamas Janet had bought him for his last birthday and slipped into bed.

She woke up and turned to face me. ""I was worried about you.""

""How was the sushi?""

""It was good. I got you an eggroll.""

""I saw it. Thank you.""

""How was your walk?""

""Long."" I gave my wife (not his) a peck on the lips. ""Goodnight, Jan.""

[IP] A Girl and Her Dragon,SpyderEyez,"“Veronica, wake up.” Connor stood above her bed, dressed in a heavy coat, two lanterns in hand.

She rubbed the sleep away from her eyes. “What?”

He handed her a lantern. He tapped her on the shoulder. “Tag.” He rushed off, his bare feet padding away into the distance.

Veronica smiled. She leapt out of bed and ran after him, barefoot and in a white night gown. She ran after him, clearing the stairs in bounds. She followed the bobbing light.

Out the doors and into the vast yard. Through the splashing mud, ignoring the cold, laughing as she went, soaking in his laughter. He ran through fields and around houses. She followed. He ran down to the creek where they had spent so many afternoons. He extinguished his lantern. She ran past the tree he was hiding behind.

“Boo!” he exclaimed as she ran past.

Veronica jumped and screamed. She gave him a shove. He pulled her into his arms and embraced his one true companion.

They sat down. She held his hand and he held hers. She shivered in the early spring cold. He gave her his coat. They lay down together, staring at the clear and brilliant stars through the newly budding trees. Just the stars and them.

“I’m glad we met.” Veronica traced a lazy eight on his chest with her pinky finger.

“Can you imagine how different our lives would’ve been if we hadn’t?”

“I shudder to imagine.” She got closer to him. “Kiss me.”

He turned toward her waiting lips. Pain struck him. He gasped in anguish and sat up.

“What’s wrong?” She realized. “No…” Desperately, she searched for a moon. Just the stars and them.

The both shot to their feet. She wrapped her arms around him desperate to keep his transformation held in. He pushed her away and dropped to his knees. She put her fingertips to her lips, eyes wide. He doubled over in pain, placing his forehead on the ground, tearing up the dirt with his fingers.

Bones popped out of place with twisting thuds and cracks. His skin tore and broke. Ribs ripped themselves out of his back and formed into the beginnings of wings. His legs and arms stretched. Nails became claws like broadswords. The dim light of the lantern reflected off of newly developing ivory scales. His whiplike tail bones cascaded out of his back. He grew to enormous size, bigger than he could ever achieve within the confines of the dungeon.

The dragon hulked over Veronica. In his pain and thrashing fear he knocked over trees and the lantern. It extinguished itself on the wet ground, leaving the two in pitch black. 

He flapped his wings, preparing to take off. He was unthinking, beastial. Veronica wrapped her arms around his neck and climbed on, determined to not let him suffer alone. With a powerful flap, a gust the type of which would come from a thunderstorm, he took off.

Westward. They flew faster than either of them had ever imagined. Ground lit only by stars and houses flashed past them. The coat was whipped from Veronica’s shoulders and the blistering wind hurt her skin. She shut her eyes and pressed her face into his neck. It was good she missed what was below.

Battlefields breezed under them. Corpses buried and unburied littered ground torn up for trenches. They reached the encampment of the forces of their kingdom, then the front lines. If they hadn’t been so high they could’ve heard cries of “Dragon!” from below. Both sides fired arrows and threw spears. They easily pierced the young, soft scales of a dragon born that night. He roared with pain, making Veronica’s ears ring. Unthinking, he burned soldiers of both armies.

They flew for hours. Exhaustion and blood loss conquered Connor. He came to rest on the wall of an abandoned temple, beautiful in it’s time, ruined by battle. Veronica slid off of his scaly hide, hitting the ground painfully. Light from the newly dawning sun reflected in her brilliant hair.

She surveyed her love’s wounds. Tears came to her eyes.

""Shh..."" Veronica cooed, ""Everything will be fine."" She said this as much for herself as for him.

He huffed smoke from his nostrils and moaned. The spears and arrows could be the death of him. For the first time in his life, Connor was very afraid of dying.

“Come down from there,” she said, “Let me help you.”

Connor crawled down off his perch, curling up on the broken ground. Carefully but with anxious speed, Veronica pulled out spears and arrows from his broken hide. His moaning became less and less draconic as the sun rose.

Tears streamed down Veronica’s face. The sun, the end of the night of a new moon, was reaching Connor’s battered body. As Veronica pulled out the last of the arrows he began transforming again. His body shriveled, bones shrinking and popping back in place. Scales molted and fell. The tail evaporated. He was left naked. Veronica held him in her arms.

He was covered in wounds that he could’ve survived as a dragon. As a man…

“Veronica.” Blood trickled from his mouth.

She sobbed. She pressed her face into his bloody chest, breathing in his scent, so familiar, now tainted by the iron tang that hung in the air around him. “Yes?”

“Veronica, I love you.”

Her crying consumed her. She wailed as his blood soaked into her nightgown. She grew quiet again, her crying dying along with him. “I love you too, Connor.”

He sputtered. Blood marred Veronica’s face. “Veronica,” he whispered, “I’m so scared.”

Veronica arrived in the Duchy of Tylof when she was six years old. She and her parents arrived by carriage, followed on foot by their servants and slaves.

""But *why*, mother?"" little Veronica moaned, pulling her headscarf down tighter over her eyes, ""Why did we have to leave Bardel? We've always lived there.""

""Hush,"" Lady Farr Reinol said, ""I already told you."" She flipped her burning red hair with her ring encrusted right hand. ""The Duke needs your father for the war. We don't know how long the war will take, so we are all going.""

Veronica looked out of the side of the carriage. To her, who had never seen all of their hired and unhired help in one place, the procession seemed to stretch off into the horizon, parade unending. She waved to them before looking at her father.

""Why are we having a war, papa?"" she asked.

""One doesn't *have* a war, Veronica."" Her father, Lord Marris Reinol, didn't look at her as he spoke. The bald man, muscular from years of combat but potbellied from years of drinking to forget, stared out at the seemingly endless fields of green springtime-sprouting wheat. ""One *goes* to war. One has a tea party. One has a wedding. One suffers a war."" He 'harumphed', sending his mustache and beard hairs aflutter. ""We're here.""

Veronica leapt out of the carriage as soon as it halted. She ran around in circles, eager to stretch her legs, immediately losing a shoe and dirtying her dress.

""Veronica!"" her mother seethed, ""Come here!""

She ran to her mother's side (doubling back briefly to pick up her shoe) and only then noticed the very regal set of four people her father was already kneeling in front of. Her mother shoved her shoe on her foot and dragged her by the wrist to kneel in front of the unfamiliar family.

A mother, a father, and two sons. The father, the Duke Arhen of Tylof, was dressed in glittering armor etched with scenes of violent battle, the intricacies of which extended down to the hair on a man's arm. He gave off an affable, kindly aura, reflected in his light eyes and equally light hair. The mother, sapling-thin and uncurvacious (completely unlike Veronica's own mother) was equally friendly looking, although there was a pain behind her eyes that even a young child could see. She wore a purple satin gown with a train that flowed so far it required four servants to keep it from dragging. Her dark brown hair was only half as long as the dress.

The two boys couldn't have been more different. The elder, a young man already, kept his nose pointed upward and his arms folded, attempting to seem wise and battle tested to hide his youthful fear. The armor he wore was less intricate than his father's and more battle-scarred (although, in reality, practice-scarred). He was as bald as her father and his eyes were a pale, icy blue. 

The younger brother hid behind his mother's skirt. He was about Veronica's height, blonde with brown eyes, and very shy. Veronica, restless and energetic, immediately wanted to befriend him.

""Rise, m'Lord,"" the affable Duke said, ""I trust you traveled safely?""

---

The first night in the castle was lonely and the day had been disheartening. The first failure was trying to get to know the younger son, Conrad. As soon as the formal greeting had ended the adults (along with the retinue of servants) had gone inside the castle, leaving the two children under the watchful care of Conrad's nursemaid. Veronica bravely strode up to the young lord.

She curtsied smartly. ""I'm Veronica, a Reinol of Bardel. And you, m'Lord?""

The young noble pressed his face into his nursemaid's skirt. ""Connor.""

""What was that?""

""I'm Connor.""

""Pleasure to meet you!"" She smiled a mile wide. ""Tag!"" She tapped him on the shoulder and ran toward a nearby tree. Hiding in the shade, giggling to herself, it took her a while to realize Connor hadn't followed her. She looked out from her hiding spot. Connor trudged toward the castle door. His nursemaid walked swiftly to Veronica.

She gave a quick bow, hand pressed to her chest. ""I am terribly sorry, Lady Reinol. Lord Archen is very shy.""

Veronica was mortified.

The next horrible thing was dinner. Both families sat at a long table decked with delicacies, many of which Veronica had never seen before. Her fortunes seemed to be looking up, she thought as her mouth watered.

""Young lady,"" the Duchess said, patting the seat next to her, ""come eat next to me tonight.""

Veronica was delighted. The regal beauty and poise of this kindly woman filled her with awe. She rushed over immediately to take her place. What happened next ruined that.

""Ah, young dear,"" the Duchess said, ""we can't have you eating with your scarf on though, can we?""

Before Veronica could do anything the Duchess had untied the knot keeping it in place. Down it floated into her lap. Veronica went pale. She put her face in her hands. The embarrassment was too much. Tears sprang to her eyes.

Her light-grey hair tumbled down over her shoulders. The eyes of Veronica's mother went wide. Lady Farr Reinol stood up, her teeth grinding audibly. Soft weeping, muffled by child hands, was the only sound in the pristine dining hall. Her headscarf was returned to her. They ate in silence.

She cried into a pillow in her new room. What a day. The only noble boy her age in the castle didn't want to be friends and her secret had been revealed. Could life get any worse for a child of six in an unfamiliar place?

A knock came from the door. ""Go away!"" she shouted. Footsteps that weren't her father or mother tapped off into the distance. Besides, they wouldn't have taken 'Go away!' for an answer, so who could it have been? She got up to check. She opened the door and looked out in the hallway. No one there. 

She started closing the door when she noticed a scrap of parchment on the floor. She unfolded it. Written in small letter were the words ""I am sorry you cried. I know how it feels to have a bad secret.""

---

A few days passed before Veronica first heard the basement screams. During the days she’d wandered around, exploring the castle, meeting the children of other nobles the Duke had summoned. They all lived in smaller houses dotted around the castle grounds. Veronica’s father, the commanding general of the Duke’s forces, had earned the privilege to live within its ancient walls.

Connor still avoided her as much as he could, sticking to his room, reading books alone. Veronica frequently tried to talk to her housemate. The had a single conversation during one breakfast.

“Jam?”

“What?” Connor asked.

“Could you pass the jam?” Connor slid the bowl across the table. “Thank you.” Silence. “Do you like jam?”

Connor took a large bite of the slab of ham on his plate. “It’s alright.”

The night was black as pitch. There was no moon out. While the men planned, the women and children entertained themselves with books and simple crafts in the great hall. Silent, obedient servants waited on them with wines, teas, sweets. Connor sat in a corner by the fireplace, reading a book about statecraft (“It’s never too early for a lordling to learn about leadership,” his father had said) while Veronica stood by a bookshelf on the opposite side of the room. She pulled out books, one by one, quickly abandoning them as she lost interest. Where were all the pictures?

A low, piercing moan made her spine tingle. She looked behind her, dropping the book she held. Connor had dropped his as well. He was doubled over, head clutched in his hands, rocking back and forth. His moaning stung her ears.

Connor’s mother dropped the sowing she’d been doing and rushed to his side. She lifted him to his feet and walked him out. Veronica looked at her own mother, who had wilfully ignored the whole thing, instead choosing to brush her shimmering red hair. She must have known something Veronica did not.

That night, Veronica lay awake in her bed. Roars that shook the foundations of the castle were coming from the basement. Some ungodly large monster must have been trapped in the dungeon, she thought. Unable to sleep, she got out of bed. She lit a candle and wandered down the hallway. She wanted to check on Connor, to see if his headache had been cured, to see if he was alright. She knocked on the door.

No answer.

She knocked again. Hot wax trickled down onto the back of her hand. She knocked again. She opened the door. “Connor,” she whispered. No response. “Connor, are you feeling better?” Still silence. He must have been asleep despite the horrific screams of the monster. She walked in, the candle illuminating a dim circle around her. His bed was empty.
",CyberPunkButNotAPunk
[IP] A Girl and Her Dragon,SpyderEyez,"“Did you believe what you saw?” Connor whispered. Veronica had been silent for almost all of breakfast.

“Pass the jam.”

“Veronica.” He put his hand on her’s. “Please, look at me.”

She looked at him. The dining hall was empty except for them. They could hear each other’s pulses. She pulled her hand away. “I need a while to think about it.”

“You wanted to know.”

“It wasn’t what I had expected.”

“Of course it wasn’t. Why would you?”

“Your bad secret.”

“What?”

“The note.” She met his eyes. “The one you left for me. The first night.”

“My curse.”

Veronica grabbed the jam from across the table and smeared some across a biscuit. It was made from blackberries they’d picked and handed over to the cooking staff. They’d made it too sugary. “Your roars.” She let out a long sigh. “Worse than my curse.” She lifted the biscuit to her mouth.

“Are we still friends?”

“How could we not be?” She smiled as she took a bite.

Farr Reinol lounged on a sofa under the high vaulted ceilings of the ballroom. With almost all the noblemen off at war, it had fallen into dusty disrepair. The click-clicking of echoing bootheels roused her from her half slumber. Excited, she peaked her head above the arms of the couch to get a look. “Marris…” But the name died in her mouth.

Instead Connor, now a man of seventeen, stood before her. She held back tears. He looked so much like…

“Lady Reinol,” he said, performing a quick bow, “may I speak with you?”

She stood up for him and curtsied before folding her hands together and looking down. “What would you wish to speak about, young Lord?”

“Please,” he said, “don’t speak so formally to me. You are more than my equal.”

She looked up at him and smiled. She felt proud of him, having watched him grow up into a strong young man. She sat and motioned for him to join her. He did. “What did you want to talk about, Connor?” She noticed his pursed lips and furrowed brow. Tight, constricted breathing wheezed from his nose.

A letter, crumpled, was clutched in his hand. He opened his mouth to speak, but shut it. He shoved the letter into his surrogate aunt’s hands. She opened it and read. Her fingertips shook. It fell to the floor. She reached over to him and pulled him into her large chest.

He burst into tears. The great wracking sobs shook his body. Gently, motherly more than she’d ever been with Veronica, she patted his head and back. She rocked him back and forth, shooshing like one would a newborn.

War letters like that… she hoped to never receive one of her own.

“I am sorry. I am so, so sorry.” Farr repeated those words until they became stale in her mouth.

Eventually, the tears paused. “I need to tell my mother.”

“She doesn’t know yet?”

“I had a bad feeling about today’s letter so I kept it from her.”

She hugged the son she had always wanted but never gotten. “I’ll go with you.”

---

That night was a new moon.

The beast in the dungeon cried great tears that puddled the floors. Veronica, as she had many times before, stayed up with him to help him through the night. She gently stroked his neck as he slowly, so slowly, drifted off to a fitful sleep. They shared each other’s grief these days.

The sleeping creature, massive in the way one would think of gods as massive, dwarfed the lithe body of his best companion. She slept beneath his wing that night.

---

The war was winding down in the eighteenth year of Connor and Veronica’s lives. Men, slaves, and treasure were returning from the west but it wasn’t yet ended. Veronica’s father was still at war, always the faithful general. Connor had slowly adjusted to being fatherless. His mother had locked herself in the lesser-library. She couldn’t adjust to widowhood. Farr waited on Tiliel hand and foot, her constant companion. Farr almost seemed rejuvenated by her new role, finally becoming close to her housemate.

Winter snow fell.

The young man and the young woman, bundled in furs, walked through the marketplace of the city the castle protected. They were regal. Heads turned everywhere they went. Veronica’s hair shimmered red brighter than her mother’s ever had. Connor was confused for his father by some of the older inhabitants of the city.

They browsed bakery shops and foreign fruit stands, butchers and confectioners. A retinue of servants followed behind to carry whatever they selected. They were holding a banquet in honor of returning soldiers.

As they carried out their mission, Connor gripped Veronica’s hand. She smiled.

---

Winter passed. Early spring arrived. Snow melt raised the levels of the creeks and muddied the fields. The sunsets, though, were vivid. They watched one together.

“We never did end up playing tag.”

“Hmm?” Connor mumbled.

“The first day we met.” She pointed down at the yard in front of the entrance. They sat above it, mounted on the high walls of the castle. “I tagged you. You never chased after me.”

“How did we never play tag? All children play tag.”

“We never did.”

“Huh.”

“On the few occasions the other children came to the castle…”

“Not often.”

“We played with *them*. But never just the two of us.”

Connor exhaled. His breath clouded in the chill air. Not to be outdone, Veronica let out a bigger breath and smiled wide. “Veronica,” Connor said.

“Yes, Connor?”

He looked her straight in the eyes. To him, her brilliance was almost blinding. He lost himself and forgot to breathe. She filled in the gap. They kissed.

[IP] A Girl and Her Dragon,SpyderEyez,"The roars happened around once a month, always on the night of a new moon. It took almost a full year for Connor to open up to Veronica.

Veronica was sitting in the garden, eyes closed. The sun beat down. The soft grass buoyed her gently off the dirt. A gentle breeze lapped at her headscarf. Silently, Connor sat down next to her.

“Do you miss him?”

Veronica opened her eyes. She stared at her shy companion. “Miss who?”

“Your father.”

She thought. She’d never been very close with her father. She loved him, of course, but he had never expressed his love for her or her mother very well. “I do miss him, but I don’t know if he misses me.” She sighed and leaned back, placing her hands behind her head. “Why?”

“I miss mine.” He hugged his knees to his chest. “My mother misses him too.”

“Who are they fighting?”

“I’m not really sure. Someone to the west.”

Veronica sighed. “They’ll be fine, I think. My father has been fighting since before I was born.” She opened her eyes and looked at Connor. “So, do you know why the roaring happens?”

“Roaring?”

“Never mind.” She sighed and looked at the clouds. A white, fluffy dot bobbed westward. Maybe it would float over her father. “Why did you want to talk to me today?”

“I wanted to ask why you always cover your hair.”

Veronica sat up. She sighed. “My mother and grandmother were blessed by the gods. They were born with the fire of the first forge in them.” She shrugged. “Or something like that.”

“So what about you?”

“I was cursed.”

“Who cursed you?”

“A witch from my mother’s village. She cursed her when she was taken by my father. She’s a war-trophy bride, she says.”

Connor stood up. “You should talk to my mother.”

---

“Connor said I should speak with you, my Lady.”

Lady Archen stared wistfully out the window of the upstairs lesser-library. Dust flitted lazily by the angled light that billowed like wind into the otherwise shadowed room. Lady Archen wore black. The massive armchair she sat in enveloped her. She slowly turned her head toward her young house guest.

“What was that, Veronica?” Veronica repeated herself. “Ah. Here.” She patted her lap. “Sit with me. The view out the window is lovely.”

She hopped up. The view was, indeed, beautiful. It was early fall and vast swathes of the wheat fields that encompassed the world were slowly being cut away by farmhands, creating abstract lines that curved gently, a curve so gentle only someone as high as they were could perceive it. The sky was a blue so light it was almost a snowy white. The few clouds there were cast perfectly matching shadows that sluggishly sailed across the slowly rolling plain. To the west, at the very edge of the horizon, smoke rose. Lady Archen wrapped her arms around Veronica.

“What did you want to talk about?”

“Connor said to speak to you. He said that when I mentioned… when I mentioned curses.”

Lady Archen shuddered. “I always wanted a daughter, you know.” She smiled a smile Veronica couldn’t see. “I do love my children, though. I hope Victor is taking care of his father.” Victor, the elder son, had gone to war with the men.

“Do… you know anything about curses, m’Lady?”

“I know curses.” She gave Veronica a light squeeze. She changed the subject. “Do you like it here? I know it’s not your home, but after a year, are you comfortable?”

“It’s a very pretty place. I miss having my friends though, m’Lady.”

“Please, call me Taliel. What about the other children? Or some of the young servants?”

“The other children don’t want to play with me.”

“Why not?” She turned her head to look her in the eyes. “A pretty young girl like you, courageous and kind?”

“Because I live in the castle.”

“Ahh.”

“Why is Connor so shy?”

“Connor is… long-suffering. He is shy because he doesn’t want his problems to become problems for anyone else.”

“That doesn’t make any sense.”

Lady Archen kissed the top of Veronica’s head. “I’ve always regretted that dinner. The one where I revealed your hair. It must have been embarrassing for you.” She untied the headscarf. Veronica said nothing. Taliel began braiding her hair, gently twisting each lock of ashen-grey. “Would you forgive me?”

Veronica nodded. After all this time, the pain had dulled.

“Oh!” Taliel exclaimed. She moved a lock of hair into Veronica’s field of view. Mixed in with a forest of grey, a few strands of red.

---

They did play with the neighboring noble children on occasion. This particular day they were playing knights and dragons. A large boy insisted on being captain of the knights.

“And you, m’Lord Connor,” he said, “will be captain of the dragons.”

Connor clenched his fists. His face turned bright red and he walked away towards the castle. Veronica watched him go. The game went on without him.

---

Years passed. Veronica and Connor spent more and more time together. Their fathers’ were still gone. Sometimes, letters came. Sometimes, silence. They had each other.

“What do you want to do?” Connor asked.

“I’m fine just staying here for a while.” She looked behind her. Two adults, a man and a woman, escorts, sat reading. “I wish the servants would leave, though.” They sat there, soaking their feet in a babbling creek. Summer foliage shaded them from bright sunshine. Today was the sixth anniversary of the day Veronica came to the castle. Neither of them had noticed.

Veronica, swiftly growing into a young woman, no longer covered her hair. Her hair was more red than grey at this point, giving the impression of a wispy, smoky flame. She was taller than Connor by a little, and thin like his mother rather than her own. Connor was naturally muscular, stocky. Several years of swordplay and hard work contributed to his appearance. He remained soft spoken whether dealing with one of the other children or with servants, kind but distant to slaves. A young gentleman his father would be proud of.

He only opened up to Veronica. After about their second year together they were inseparable. If they had known their fathers’ planned to have the two of them married (a good political move) it would’ve changed no part of their relationship. They were the only members of their own inner circle.

“Connor.”

“Yes?” He laid on his back, staring at a pair of bluebirds and a lone red cardinal.

“Can I ask you something?”

“Anything.”

“Anything? Promise?”

“Anything.”

She lay back as well. One of the bluebirds had flown away at this point. “Why do your headaches only happen on the nights of a new moon?”

He stayed silent. He turned away from her.

“You promised,” she reminded.

“I know.”

“So?”

He turned toward her. She turned her face toward him. “If I tell you, you wouldn’t believe me.”

“I would.”

“No.” He sat up. “I’d have to show you.”

---

“You’ll know when you need to leave.”

“Why are we in the dungeon?” The night of a new moon had arrived. They both carried torches to light the blackness. The dungeon was a massive open floor, broad, long, and damp. The ceiling was only a couple of feet above their heads, lending to a claustrophobic air that fought against the way Veronica spent her days. Her confusion was replaced by realization. She went pale. “Connor…”

The headache began. He dropped his torch. It fell into a deep puddle, quickly extinguishing. Connor gripped at his face, pulling, tearing at his hair. He screamed. The scream became a roar.

Veronica saw. She fled.

""We'll be there soon,"" he said, ""don't worry.""

Dunes rose and fell like slowly rolling waves. It had been months since Ar-Hazem had last seen the ocean. The desert was not his native environment. He had been born on the coast, shaded by palm trees and kissed by sea-breeze daily. His desire to become a poet had driven him from home. He'd set off toward Para, the City of Poets and the seat of the King of Pasharah, to find a mentor.

None of his quest would matter if he ran out of water.

Heat glistened off of the sandy waves. A gust of hot wind beat him in the face with grains, slowly eating away at his peeling skin. He coughed and sputtered as sand hit his tongue. He grabbed his waterskin. Nothing.

The sun beat down. A few more hours. Midday, vultures began to circle. He stared up at them until his eyes blurred and he was forced to look away. His camel stumbled.

""Whoa, boy,"" he tried to say. Instead, his dry mouth kept him from speaking. He coughed.

The vultures left him behind. Even they had limits to where they roamed in the desert. Ar-Hazem pulled a compass from his pocket. The needle spun around in circles that to his dehydrated mind seemed to be ever widening. Not good.

The world slipped out from underneath him. He fell.

---

He awoke at sunset. The scent of roasting meat lapped at his nose like an puppy eager to wake it's master. As his eyes opened his first sight was clear water. A perfectly round pool had welled up out of the ground. Ar-Hazem dragged himself to it with his fingers, hands digging into the grass (Grass?). He tore off his keffiyeh and dunked his face into the crystal pool.

He drank until his stomach sloshed. He sighed, saved, delighted.

""Are you enjoying my kingdom?""

Ar-Hazem looked up from his prone position. A man dressed in kingly garb (satins, gold thread, a crown with peacock feathers and rubies) sat by a fire, cooking something. He stared at Ar-Hazem with pure black eyes that looked like deep pits against his unnaturally pale skin. Not wishing to be rude, Ar-Hazem pushed himself up to a kneeling position. He bowed.

""I owe you my life,"" Ar-Hazem said.

""Do you?"" The pale man smiled.

Ar-Hazem, exhausted and hungry, ignored what he had said. ""What are you eating?"" No response but an ever widening smile. Ar-Hazem's camel was gone and it suddenly dawned on him. ""Oh.""

The pale man handed him a slab of meat over rice... on a gold and porcelain plate. ""He wouldn't have been able to carry you any further anyway."" Ar-Hazem took the plate. Tears almost came to his eyes. ""This way he doesn't go to waste.""

Ar-Hazem nodded. He ate with his hands. The taste of the meat tore the grief from his mind. He had never tasted anything like this. What magic did this man have? ""What did you do?""

""I cooked it.""

""But how?""

The smiling man shrugged. His pale skin grew brighter as the sun set deeper into the distant horizon. ""You never answered my question."" Ar-Hazem shot him a quizzical look. ""Are you enjoying my kingdom?""

Ar-Hazem truly observed where he was for the first time. An oasis, surrounded on all sides by the desert he'd just traveled through. Tall trees shaded him. Bird flitted around their heads, making last minute preparations for their nighttime nesting. The air was filled with the scents of saffron and cardamom. ""Where are we?""

""My little kingdom."" The man's smile vanished. The campfire flared. ""My little prison.""

Ar-Hazem paused with a gob of rice in his hand. ""Your prison?""

""Mm-hmm.""

""Why can't you leave?"" He looked around again. ""Why would you want to leave? It's beautiful here."" The oasis sang into his ears. A siren song teased his mind, asking him to give up his dreams of poetry to stay here, forever.

""I've lived here for a thousand years.""

""A thousand.""

""I am bored."" The pale man looked at Ar-Hazem again. His face now visibly glowed with its own light as the sun disappeared completely. ""But now I can leave.""

""Why now?""

""You."" The pale man stood up. His feet didn't quite touch the ground. He forced Ar-Hazem to put down his plate and pulled him to his feet. ""I can leave if I'm with you. At least...""

""At least what?""

""At least as long as you have ambition."" He grabbed Ar-Hazem's face with both hands. ""Do you have a goal, Ar-Hazem from the sea?""

The siren song died. His poetry aspirations flooded back to him. He dreamed of writing poems for kings and receiving their patronage. He desired to write heroic epics that spanned the lives of kingdoms. He wanted to write verse that placed him on the level of a god. ""I do have goals. I need to get to Para.""

""Para."" He smirked. ""Easy."" The man stepped out onto the sand. His body lit on fire and evaporated in a cloud of smoke. In his place was a jet black horse with glowing eyes. ""Get on."" It said.

Ar-Hazem mounted the black charger. ""I never caught your name,"" he asked the horse, the man, the djinn.

""Call me Rostam."" The oasis began to vanish, flickering like a mirage. The djinn smiled a large, horse-toothed grin. ""I think we are going to have fun.""

They shot off into the desert. *To be continued...?*",CyberPunkButNotAPunk

[IP] Group Effort,Rich700000000000,"The employees of the Bureau of Redirection for the city of Grendel clicked away. Thousands of key strokes clattered, echoing up into high ceilings of the office. Trails of wires trickled across into vast webs of electrical conduits, connecting the tall spider tanks that towered over the workers. ""Remember,"" the voice over the loudspeaker said, ""your work is important. In-house counseling services are available both during and after your shift.""

Towers of coke cans teetered over the keyboards. The glow of screens washed out the faces of the employees. Daryl Hammond leaned back from his screen. He tied his hair back into a ponytail and took a swig from the bottle of ice tea on his desk.

""He's doing it again,"" he said.

""Who's doing what?"" Terry Marion asked. She had sat at the desk across from Daryl for as long as either of them could remember. The red shirt she wore stood out in the gloom.

""Citizen B-89.""

""Sure, that's who, but what is he doing?""

""Trying to get into the building.""

""Our building?""

""Yeah.""

""Hmm.""

""What do you think? Something fun or something mundane?""

""What did you do last time?""

""I made his boss call him.""

""That's boring as hell. Go for it, man.""

Daryl took another sip and cracked his knuckles. He grabbed a tube with a dome on the end, like a contact lens, and put it on his left eye. He could see the whole city, built atom by atom to perfect realism in his mind. He put his fingers to the keys, omniscient with the power of the system. With a few lines of code, he changed the world.

A steam explosion blasted a manhole cover off of the ground. It slammed into the underside of an unoccupied self-driving taxi, flipping it on its side. It slid, sparking and screaming, down the street, into Citizen B-29's own car. B-29 immediately stopped knocking on the door and turned around to face his car.

Easy fix, Daryl thought to himself. B-29 would be focused on getting his car towed and finding a way home. A job well done. And then the car exploded. Jagged chunks of metal spiraled and twisted through the air. Citizen B-29 was skewered by half of his front axle. Daryl tore the tube away from his eye. He stared at the screen, and then his hands.

""What happened?"" Terry asked.

""I fucked up.""

The closest spider tank turned it's massive cannon toward Daryl's work station. His computer screen went black. The clip-clopping of tall cowboy boots slid up behind him. A hand was placed on Daryl's shoulder.

""Mister Hammond,"" said the voice behind him, ""I need you to come with me.""

---

The cowboy booted android man was dressed like a secret service man. He walked Daryl down the long, empty, windowless corridor. It led toward Control/Counseling, the central hub of the government building where the Bureau resided. Daryl had never been there before.

""Don't worry, Mister Hammond. You're going to be fine."" Daryl wasn't sure if he was telling the truth.

They entered into a room that looked like a hotel lobby, complete with low-jazz waiting room music. It was staffed entirely by androids. Bright fluorescent lights stung Daryl's eyes after coming from the gloom of the redirection room. The room was empty besides them. The cowboy android walked him to the front counter and spoke for him.

""Mister Hammond for Doctor Roy.""

The pretty android woman clicked around on her computer. Her computer was holographic and motion sensitive. It made Daryl wonder why they had to use such old, crappy computers in their work. The android looked up at him.

""You can wait there."" She pointed at the rows of back to back chairs behind him. ""The doctor will see you shortly.""

Daryl and cowboy sat down. Cowboy pulled out a magazine and read. Daryl just stared at his hands. About five minutes passed.

""Daryl Hammond?"" Dr. Roy said, standing in front of him. He was a tall android, slick backed hair, plaid shirt and jeans, kindly looking. He held a clipboard. ""You can come with me now.""

""I'll wait here for you,"" cowboy said, not pulling his eyes away from the magazine.

Daryl walked with Dr. Roy to his office. Still lit with fluorescent lights, it at least had a ficus tree to distract from the piercing white. A small water feature babbled on Roy's desk. A couch set against the wall.

""You can sit down, Daryl."" Daryl sat. Dr. Roy pulled up his chair from behind his desk to in front of it and sat. He crossed his legs and took a pen to his clipboard. ""So how are you feeling, Daryl?""

""Umm... I'm not totally sure. What should I say?""

""Just whatever comes to mind. I'm here for you.""

Daryl sat silently for a few seconds before placing his head in his hands. ""I don't... I never wanted to kill... anyone.""

Roy nodded. ""You shouldn't think of it as your fault.""

He cried. ""But it is!"" The weight of his actions pressed down on him. ""I'm not a killer!"" Big blubby tears and snot globs coated his hands. Roy gave him a box of tissues.

They talked for a while. Roy let him cry as much as he needed. Slowly, Roy's words sunk in. It wasn't his fault. The explosion was a glitch. The system had missed that eventuality. It wasn't his fault.

After half an hour, Daryl stood up. ""Thank you,"" he said.

Dr. Roy shook his hand. ""Anytime you need to talk, I'm here. Remember, your job is important. You keep people away from things that could harm them.""

Daryl walked out of the little office. ""You ready to head back?"" cowboy asked.

""Yeah."" He wiped away his last remaining tear on his sleeve. He smiled. ""I'm ready to get back to work.""

As they were walking out, Terry started walking in with a cowboy-booted android of her own, identical to the one with Daryl. As they passed each other, she grabbed his arm.

""There is something wrong with the system,"" she whispered. She let go and walked on.

Daryl went back to his workstation. He got back to work. The web spanned the world and the spider tanks walked it.",CyberPunkButNotAPunk
