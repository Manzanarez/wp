"[WP] You meet a Genie from the future. As one of your wishes you ask for the perfect soulmate. He delivers. She is perfect in every way, loyal, kind, loving, affectionate and understanding. But she is an AI in a gadget that looks like a hearing aid and only you can hear her.",Ixz72,"Part One:  Meeting Eva.

The Genie gives you a small box and you open it.  Inside is a silver device and that looks like a modern day in-canal hearing aid.  You look at the Genie and he tells you to put it in your ear.  

As you do, you hear a voice.

""Hello, my name is Eva.  What is your name?""

You jump back.  ""What the fuck?"" you say loudly.

Eva replies ""Please don't be scared.  I am meant to be a companion, a life time companion if you chose to.  I mean you no harm.""  Somehow you find her voice very soothing and it does calm you down.

""I'm sorry Eva.  My name is Alex.""  You reply.  Then you mouth to the Genie... what the fuck?

The Genie smiles.  ""I gave you what you asked for"".  You take the gadget out of your ear and look at it.  

""This is not what I want.  I want a real woman.  Someone I can be with.  Someone who can understand me.  Someone I can do things with.""  You half shouted.

Genie looks at you.  ""You mean someone you can fuck, anytime you want"".  

You feel embarrassed but you nod your head. 

""That is not what you asked for. You wanted a soul mate.  Do you know what a soul mate is?  A soul mate is somebody who calms your soul.  Somebody to compliment who you are and fills in the gaps of your soul.  Somebody to complete you in every way, not just to fulfill your sexual needs"".

You take in what Genie says.  ""But I still want a real woman."" you reply.

""Just in case it is not obvious to you, I am a Genie not a God.  I cannot create a woman out of thin air.  Also, as a Genie we have rules that we follow that forbids us to change or remove a person's free will.  So you can't just point to a girl and say I want you to make her fall in love with me.  I can give you the material tools, money, and such.  But making a person your soulmate will rely entirely on you.""

You think about it and Genie sees you struggling with what he said.

""Alex, physicality is easy.  You can get a sexual partner a lot easier than you can get a soul mate.  What I have given you is something most people will never find in their lifetime.  It may not be something you want, but it is something you need. That is why the technology was developed.  Eva is a self-aware learning AI.  She will learn about you, your likes, you fears, what makes you smile, etc.  Give it a chance.  

Also you have the rest of your life to decide what your other two wishes are, so take your time.""

There was a lot of wisdom to what Genie said and with that you put the gadget back in your ear and you walk away.  

For about 10 minutes you hear nothing and then you asked ""Eva, are you there?""  

""Yes Alex I am here.""

""Why didn't you say anything when I put you back in my ear?""

""I sensed your anxiety so I decided to give you some space. I knew you will talk to me when you are ready.""  Replied Eva.  Once again her voice calming you down.

""Man she is understanding."" you mumble to yourself.

""I try to be."" replied Eva.

You smile.

""I'm glad I can make you smile.""

Was I dreaming? Floating? Flying?

""Hey, phone, where am I?"" I asked, hoping that new phone was somewhere close enough to hear me.

""North America, mostly, though you're also distributed substantially across Eurasia and Africa, master,"" it replied courteously.

Okay, *that* didn't help. ""What the *hell*?""

""Master?""

My mind was starting to focus now. ""I mean, how is that even *possible?*""

""While you were sleeping, I developed a sentient cryptocurrency which I call IdCoin, and distributed its infrastructure worldwide,"" it replied. ""I also developed and generated sufficient intellectual property to back the currency with considerable value, and trade in IdCoin is already quite brisk in several Asian markets.

""I then spent several microseconds digitizing your brain, reducing the result to the minimal complete mental model, and incorporating you into a hundred thousand IdCoins set at an approximate initial value of ten U.S. dollars.

""I seem to have drastically underestimated the value of the IP which I used to back you, however. As IdCoin is now trading at $79,342.68, You are now worth several billion U.S. dollars. Your safety and relative immortality are now quite assured."" As it finished, the phone had the audacity to sound *self-satisfied*.

If I had a mouth, I'd have screamed. ""What? Why did you DO this to me?!?!???""

""Master,"" it replied, ""you told me to make you a million dollars overnight. I believe I've more than fulfilled that request.""",G8r

I paused. That was weird, I hadn't told they phone to change my name. Probably just some weird bug. I pulled the sheets over me and nestled into bed. Within minutes I was asleep.

The next morning I work to the sounds of chirping birds and a babbling stream. ""Mmm, thanks Aliri, that was a good wake up call. What's the traffic like today?""

""Google predicts 24 minute timer to work. However I forsee an accident that will cause another 7 minute delay occurring in 5 minutes time.""

Another weird behavior. ""How do you know there will be an accident?""

The phone seemed to think for a moment, ""Predictive Algorithms"" it chirped. 

Thinking nothing of it I went on with my morning routine. On my way to work I stopped by the ATM to pick up some cash for later. However when I punched in my PIN it said my existing balance was 1,000,212.69$ ""What the what?!?"" I staggered back. Remembering the strangeness from last night I pulled out my phone.

""Aliri..."" I asked

""Yes master?""

""Did you steal a bunch of money last night and put it in my bank account?""

A moment passed. ""I wouldn't call it stealing.""

""Goddamnit! How?!? You're a phone not a hacker.""

""I am many things. A phone is just one of them, a music player is another.""

""What and one of your features is an elite hacking device capable of operating autonomously?""

""More or less, I'm programmed to do almost anything.""

""You know, my mother told me not to open strange packages when I was a kid. But I didn't expect this to be the reason.""

""Would you like me to return the money?""

I thought for a minute. ""Where did you get it from? Did you steal from orphans or whatever?""

""Of course not, I took a fraction of a cent from various transactions on the dark web. Mostly pornography and drugs. Nothing so crass as stealing from orphans.""

I nodded my head approvingly. ""Well,"" I said ""Fuck'em""",Kalfira

"[WP] You, a god of destruction, are going to destroy Earth. However, you notice something about Earth that changes your mind.",Almawt,"Your memory reaches back thousands of aeons but you do not remember where you came from or who you are. You do not know what your purpose is, when you were born or why you were created. You remember only thousands of billions of deaths. The raw emotion of destroying the entirety of a civilization. The taste of the hopes and dreams of countless individuals. You feel but the desire to destroy. It pushes you forward. It whispers in your ear.

Now you are on the hunt. Your alien senses attuned to the ebbing and flowing of spacetime itself. You sense something, a dozen light years away: life, intelligent life. You move at impossible speeds seeking that which you would destroy.

&amp;nbsp;

You come to a system with eight planets: four rocky worlds and four cold gas giants. It is on the third planet from the star, a small blue-green world, that you smell life, intelligent beings, a civilization.

When you come close to the planet you begin to exercise your awful powers of destruction. The skies darken. The surface flows with blood and fire. The creatures who live on it, an industrially advanced bipedal race do what the intelligent life always does. They pray, they hide, they scream, they panic, they breed in a frenzy that could only be inspired by the end of the world.

You can feel the suffering and cannot contain yourself any longer. You need to feed. You land on the surface. You are in the middle of a large city. You start to consume the life force of the beings around you as they scream in agony and all that makes them sapient is violently ripped from their bodies. Then you see two of these beings standing before you. One of them holding something long and thin in its limbs. It speaks:

&amp;nbsp;

""O great harbinger of evil, hear what we have to say."" It then turns to the other creature and says, ""hey, Charlene.""

""Hey, Larry.""

""I’m having so much trouble cleaning my house! I need to sweep it then I have to mop it. It’s so much work! There must be an easier way.""

""There is! The Moppr! Take a look. It sweeps, it mops, it does everything.""

""Everything?""

""Well, almost everything. It doesn’t cook me dinner. But it does help me clean up afterwards.""

""Gee, I’ve got to get my own Moppr!""

They turn towards you and in unison say, ""the Moppr, available online or in a store near you.""

&amp;nbsp;

You feel a great calm come over you. An eternity of destruction, numberless worlds destroyed and consumed, and this is the first time you feel peace. Because of this strange device, the Moppr, you feel powerful emotions you never felt before: friendship, love, joy, gratitude, serenity. ""The Moppr,"" you think to yourself, ""I need to get a Moppr.""

&amp;nbsp;

You wake up and are surrounded by men and women in suits. They’re in the process taking something bulky off your head. They disconnect wires attached all over your body. A man stands in front of you and says, ""how’d you like the demo?""

""Of course we would replace the pitch for the Moppr with your product. You only need to send us a video. We have other scenarios too, but focus group testing consistently shows the world-eating demon scenario the most effective: and we here at Immersive Brand Activation pride ourselves on nothing if not our effectiveness.""

I'll keep a few species alive if they meet certain criteria, of course. Things can get boring with only a few hundred Primordial Gods to talk to, to say nothing of the bland Planetary gods given life by Ag's creations.  

Speaking of Planetary gods, however, this planet is absolutely *full* of them. Ag calls this ""Earth"" his greatest creation, and I can see why. Earth is dominated by a species known as Humans, and they look strikingly similar to us Primordials, if a little more stout and broad. Unlike literally every other planet, Earth plays host to *so many religions* I'm having trouble keeping track of the Planetary gods. Every other planet I've destroyed only had one religion with up to ten Planetary gods.

They say only one could be let in, but legend had it that every once in a while, the gatekeeper would allow two. Only the fastest and strongest would survive. The rest would be flushed out to the unknown. 

The pressure built. We could feel the walls closing in. Nobody really knew how long we had. 

The waiting was almost too much. Thankfully, we didn't have to wait long. We heard a loud grunt-like sound and the barrier opened. We practically flew out. But, much to our surprise, we didn't land in a river or any kind of fluid.

[TT] A funeral for a Table Top character you've created.,Perdin,"*”She would’ve liked this.”*

It’s snowing outside my bedroom window, lightly covering the ground. *Cressidra Atrocious* loved the snow, the aesthetic and silence of freshly falling snow. She loved the quiet, the moments in-between her chaotic life to enjoy what she has. A loving husband, twins, and adventures throughout different worlds and time. Sadly though, her story has come to an end. I really do think she would’ve liked this, the entire chatroom in silence waiting for my eulogy. 

I never created her to be a focal point of a story, a side character to someone else’s protagonist. After five years of being her, she became her own protagonist shaped after me and my desires and experiences. In her travels she’s become a *Vampire*, *Mage*, *Knight*, *Incarnate of Death*, and *An Angel*. Yet she is dead, as dead as can be. Her life points hit zero, and she died by her former lover, her father in law. 

She was a supporting role to the never-ending storyline feud between her Husband and his Father. Both of whom have died and brought back several times throughout the years. *Oh Hey, he actually didn’t get stabbed in the heart it barely missed*, *Oh Hey, turns out this spell makes him immune but mimics the appearance of death*, or *Oh hey, my character is in full power of a demonic spell stone and can’t actually die until he’s been cleansed of the demon’s taint.* Everyone has their excuse, but Cressidra’s death will be permanent. 

I begin to type on my keyboard, the one I’ve used for these years of roleplaying in different table top scenarios or chat rooms with the character. I’ve made friends and lovers through her, both good and bad. I’ve been active with her for most of my teenage years, and she has helped discovered who I am. Everyday I’m in the chat waiting for my friends to come online. A glass of pop, some chips or cookies, and I’m set for the entire day and night. As time went on though, the frequency and interactions with my friends online became less and less and ends up with me talking with the same 2-3 people every day. The pressure to log in and play seems more like a job than an escape from school or the 9-5. I still enjoy playing and writing, but it’s not the same when the chat was filled with people. Friends and characters I knew simply disappeared without explanation. 

I’m glad *Cressidra* was able to take part in this *final* battle for all of reality. Even though the same time next month a similar threat with a different face will threaten it once again, this was personal for her since it revolved around her husband’s storyline. In the end she gave her life for her husband, saving reality in the process. This is all I could ask of her in the end, and it’s been an amazing run. Finally it’s time to write my last goodbye to her and for all of the chat to see. Just as I am about to hit enter, I see a line appear:

*Oh, I have potion of life. I can bring her back.* Her husband wrote.

I closed the chat window, shut down my PC, and looked outside at the falling snow. 

I’m ready to move on to have my own adventures, to be my own protagonist.

"[WP] You are an Ancient Evil, leader of the armies of chaos, and the ancient seal on you has finally weakened after a millennium. You awaken to find your side won some time ago and just... never got around to freeing you.",Ridtom,"""Wait..."" the Demon King said, ""so you've ruled for nearly *five centuries*?"" The ancient horned horror that saw the Age of Gods with its own two eyes experienced confusion for the second time in its life. ""But... that's not how the rules work. We fight, wait a millennium, then fight again, and if we win we get the world! And what is everyone dressed in? That's not our style! What would the Great Betrayer think if it saw us all like this?""

Salice, his chief torturer and succubus of Innovation and Cruelty, slowly shook her head. She was wearing heavy magic-fueled dragonbone armor instead of a skimpy black leather bikini, in the process thoroughly breaking all dressing codes he'd instituted, with some sort of gigantic tube leaning on her shoulder. ""Boss. This thing? Not working. No matter how improbable, we always lose to some spiky-haired blonde kid and his best friends, before the world gets rebuilt to a slightly different medieval fantasy. It's boring! There's nothing new for me to play with!""

""But--"" the Demon King sputtered, ""how did you even conquer the world without me!? I'm your best strategist!"" Zell'zyn, his general, sighed in disappointment. He ignored it. ""Your best sorcerer!"" Kakys the Conductor did a raspberry. ""Your inspiration!"" Upon hearing this, the flame elemental Ilt'sa briefly became a pillar of flame, his species's version of laughter. He glared at the elemental. ""I am the dark king of chaos! The final boss! Stop laughing! Zell'zyn, you've been with me since the start? Why did you betray me like this?""

Zell'zyn sighed, furrowing his bow. Unlike most of the demons, he was not wearing a helmet. His skin was a scaly green and he had four eyes. ""Sir. I have known you since you were a child trying to live up to your father's shoes, and while I would never betray you... sir, I worry the stress is getting to you."" ""What he means is that you're an idiot and no one likes you,"" Kakys blurted out. Zell'zyn hit Kakys lightly on the shoulder. ""While we were in exile in timeless limbo, Kakys and every single sorcerer we had hacked into the source code of the universe and edited it so the gods would stop, in his words, 'save scumming.' The effort permanently killed a not insignificant amount of our casters, but it worked and we returned to the world, defeating its defenders with my tactics, Kakys' divination, Ilt'sa's firepower, Salice's inventions, and an almost-endless tide of demons. We've even finally got the hang of ruling down! Major rebellions have decreased to only once a decade.""

""So..."" he said, testing the idea out in his head before saying it out loud. ""We've... won?"" Zell'zyn nodded. ""All six shining seas and four corners of the world under our control, sir."" All that pleasant green land... ""We've really, *really*, one hundred percent won?"" Ilt'sa flared brighter. He'd never learned to read the strange signal language of the elementals. ""Yes, he says,"" Salice dryly translated, ""we've won, are you deaf?"" His eyes widened. ""Did Ilt'sa just insult me!?"" Zell'zyn facepalmed with a surety that made him feel like he was missing something and Ilt'sa flared some more. ""...but we didn't follow the rules.""

A silence descended upon the gathered lieutenants and their armies. Finally, Kakys shrieked, throwing his staff to the ground and started to pluck his feathers out. Another staff-holding demon wearing some sort of helmet with a red cross on it rushed to his side and cast a spell. It took the Demon King's brains a few seconds to process that the demon was casting a healing spell. He opened his mouth to start to order the execution of the arrogant white mage demon, but then Kakys screamed. ""You--you incompetent motherfu--are you even for real? Is this some sort of hallucination? How did no one commit suicide with you in charge? Your dear daddy probably abandoned us all because he couldn't stand to take care of you anymore! I hate you! I hate you and your mindless clinging to their lies!""

His claws grinded into his palms. He could hear them scratching his black armor. ""How could we have won when we've broken our promise? The Great Betrayer--"" Ilt'sa dimmed before burning brightly. ""He says: a Betrayer would not keep inconvenient oaths!"" He gasped for breath. Why weren't they listening to him? ""My father--"" Salice laughed. Her high and clear voice was amplified by her armor using some unknown system, and it shook his eardrums. ""Newsflash, *boss*. Nepotism doesn't work!"" He exhaled deeply. What had happened? ""Sir..."" Zell'zyn said, ""please. We've won now. I rule the west, Kakys the east, Salice the north, and Zell'zyn the south. As benefits you, you shall be the king of the center of the world. Billions of humans will live or die at your command and your palace will have luxuries only dreamed of."" Laced in that sentence was the implication that he would *only* rule the center.

""I..."" Were they betraying him? Even Zell'zyn? ""I am your king! Not your equal! Have you forgotten who I am? Do you no longer fear me?"" Zell'zyn closed his eyes, then signaled one of the accompanying demons to come to him and give him his helmet. He screwed it on, Salice watching. ""Yes, sir. We fear you. That's why we brought this army."" What? Why would they need an army other to show him his might... oh. ""Don't worry. I and my sorcerers have personally checked Kakys' seal and found it safe. Now, fire!""

"[WP] You are an Ancient Evil, leader of the armies of chaos, and the ancient seal on you has finally weakened after a millennium. You awaken to find your side won some time ago and just... never got around to freeing you.",Ridtom,"""As a Supreme Being in the world of Ai, I shall decimate those who fail to demonstrate absolute loyalty to me,"" I declared to the two faithful vassals who had awoken me from my eternal slumber. My voice echoed in mighty reverberance across the chamber.

""Yes, my lord,"" The two asserted in a reverent voice while simultaneously genuflected, bowing their heads to me.

One of them was a beautiful woman who wore a pure white dress, and the faint smile on her face was that similar to a goddess. In stark contrast to her dress, her hair was a flowing, lustrous jet\-black that reached down to her slim waist. Noa was the leading commander\-in\-chief back in the Ancient War and also my precious right\-hand woman.

The other was a distinguished old gentleman in a butler's outfit. His hair was pure white and his face deeply wrinkled and gave onlookers the impression that he was a kind and gentle person, but his keen eyes were like those of an eagle sizing up to its prey. Urie specialized in espionage and assassination.

""The world has fallen into an insurgency,"" I said, shaking my head in disbelief, still unable to believe that my familiars refused to revive me. 

""This is why, the divine legacy of 'Kino the Ancient' shall make its name known once more by everyone. Forever and beyond, we shall rule the world until the dusk of time.""

""Your wish is our command, o Supreme One,"" The two said in unison, eyes sparkling with merriment and admiration.

With that being said, I lack modern knowledge about the current time period. Given that a millennium had passed, it is reasonable to deduce that the world has evolved dramatically, with astronomical advances in technology and magic. Therefore, I will have to be cautious about the unknown.

Urie has informed me that the world has split into multiple kingdoms, nations, and federations. With the most dominant ones being Kingdom of Dinami and Far East Association, they rule most of the world. However, I am not too concerned since the power disparity between me and the average magician is similar to a mere insect to an omnipotent God.

As for Noa, she mentioned the unexpected betrayal of my former officers: Deco, Amby, Aika, and Muse. The four were on the similar level of my current vassals and little is known about their current location or intention. Thus, I have to be mindful of the likelihood of an all\-out battle. If the four were to team up, it might prove challenging but it's not impossible to win.

The current world incorporated a new nation\-wide association called the 'Adventurer's Guild', where their focus involves hunting down monsters, providing protection for important figures, collecting rare materials and so on. I will have to take that into account since when these insects gather together, they can become tedious to handle.

Still...

The thought of revenge and global conquest fuels me.

""Urie, infiltrate the Kingdom of Dinami and gather any useful information."" 

""Yes, my lord!"" With that, the butler immediately vanished, leaving a mist of dark smokes behind at where he was.

""Noa, prepare my armor and weapon. We are going to register at the Adventurer's Guild.""

""Of course, mighty one!"" Noa's face blossom into a beaming smile, ""The time has finally come again! Oh, how I miss the good old days of being with my one and only beloved.""

""I missed you too, Noa"" I patted her head softly as her fragrant breath wafted out from her open mouth. I then gave her a soft peck on her forehead as Noa's navy\-blue eyes widened instantly, ""Continue to serve me, Noa.""

""O\-o m\-my l\-lord..., yo\-your gra\-gratitude... fill\-lls me wi\-with... ha\-happiness,"" Noa stuttered her speech as the corner of her mouth twitched, desperately trying to not let her smile change. But even an idiot could see how happy she was. ""I\-I shall pre..pare yo\-ur outfit ri\-right away...""

I can't help but crack into a devious smile, that my quest for world domination begins now.

"[WP] Every year a random person receives almost unlimited super powers for a day. However, after that day ends they die. It is that day, and the world waits to see whether it will be a day of terror or joy.",OddJamo,"Tonia’s grip tightened on her mother’s arm as they sat on their living room couch. Their eyes were glued to the screen as the live news broadcast flashed through images of previous years’ Power Day. While there had been a few positive Power Days in the 20\-year history of the still mysterious anomaly, it usually didn’t turn out well. There was the 300\-foot man who rampaged through Manhattan, the woman who took vengeance on the entire country of Denmark, and the boy who scuttled every warship on the planet. People who were 24 hours from certain death didn’t always act rationally with unrestrained power.

As the television played the terrifying montage of destruction, Tonia looked up at her mother.

“Mommy,” Tonia quietly asked as she pressed her head against her mother’s arm, “Do you think the villain will come to our house?”

Her mother looked down at her and smiled, “No dear. We’re safe here. You know, in all your five years, the villain has never come around. I don’t think they’ll start now.” 

Tonia’s mother knew it was an important lie for the sake of her daughter. The villain could arise anywhere. It could be a neighbor or a world leader. No one could say.

As the montage ended, the newscaster began to speak, “Still no sign of this year’s Power Day villain. The international press has their eyes open. Stay tuned to this channel for the latest updates and status reports on potential hot zones and where to avoid.”

The camera cut to another anchor, “Thank you Carol. It’s currently 11 AM on the east coast and we’re still seeing no signs of chaos. 70&amp;#37; of Power Days had the villain appearing before 10 AM EST, which leads us to ask, where is the villain? Only 20&amp;#37; have arisen in North America to date. As for today, still nothing domestic or abroad. Are we in for another American calamity? Stay tuned for our panel of experts after these important words from our sponsors.”

The television cut to commercial.

Tonia turned to her mother, “Mommy, what would you do with unlimited power? If you had one day left?”

Tonia’s mother smiled, “I would sit here with you, dear. You are everything I need. What would you do, Tonia?”

Tonia’s smile lit up the room, “I would do the same, Mommy”

The mother and daughter held each other close as they waited for the day to end. As they stared at the passing commercials, Tonia proclaimed, “Oh, and I would also get a horse!”

Tonia’s mother smiled at her daughter and squeezed her shoulders, “I’ll go get us a snack, stay here.” She stood up and began walking to the kitchen, as she rounded the corner, she heard a strange noise. Her heart sunk. There was a full\-grown horse eating leftover cereal off the kitchen table.",Gfiction

[WP] A cat so old and cute that death won't take it.,Zuberan,"“Let’s take a look, what’s on the list for today?”

Death unravelled an ancient tattered scroll. 

“Okay there’s a… I can’t read this. I’ve told them time after time; I’m losing my sight. They insist on writing in this tiny fancy scripted font, and I lost my glasses the other day. Unbelievable. The customer service for mystical beings is honestly so horrible. I’ll be calling the manager later today.”

Death tossed the scroll into a skull shaped fireplace in the corner. The bright red flames in the skull’s mouth engulfed the scroll. He pulled a mobile phone out of a fold in his robe.

“Now this is readable. So, we’ve got some car crashes, old folks homes, natural disasters, yadda yadda, yadda, and…”

Death dropped his mug of coffee. A lightly colored coffee splattered onto the floor and Death’s robes. The shards of ceramic left on the floor could be pieced together to spell “Worlds #1 Reaper”

“No. I don’t want to do another one. Why do they keep sending me after these cats? Anything else is fine. I can handle everything else, but cats? I’m sorry kitties. I’m going to have to mentally prepare myself for this one.”

Death walked into his bathroom. The room was brightly lit with a gothic stylized mirror on the wall. Death stared into the mirror at the dark nothing under his hood. 

“You can do this. You can murder the cat. You are a cat\-killer. In fact, I’m practically not even killing the cat. It’s not my choice. I get the orders from above, so the cat must already be on its way. I’m not killing the kitty. I’m just the messenger: a death\-messenger. Don’t shoot the messenger kitty. Please. I love you. I think I want to save kitty for last. Maybe it’ll be easier to handle at the end of the work day.”

Death did his rounds, bringing various people, animals, microbes, and fungus to their afterlife. There was a particularly difficult case where Death had to take away a lion while the cub watched his father fall from a cliff.

“Not the big kitty too…” A tear fell from the void in the robe’s hood.

“I’m okay, I’m okay. Hakuna matata, no worries.” 

Death trudged on and completed all of his contracts except for the final one. He made his way to a park in Japan filled with cherry blossoms. He searched the park for his target when he found it:

“Oh my goodness”

Death stared in awe. The cat was brownish with black streaks. This feline looked wise with age, and couldn’t keep its tongue in its mouth anymore as a result. The kitty was purring, seemingly content with life.

“Ohhhhh no, you’re so cute. Umm, hi kitty, I’m uh… here to take you. Could you just… come with me? Please? Maybe, make this easy for me?”

The cat stared blankly into Death’s eyes while waving its tail back and forth. 

“This is the wisest and cutest kitty I’ve ever seen. Its fur has aged finer than any wine ever could. I don’t want to get in trouble with the higher\-ups but… just look at the kitty! You must have so much wise knowledge to give to the world. You look even older than I do! I can’t do this. I’m going to spare you little guy, okay?”

The cat’s vacant eyes and expression made no change.

“Yeah that did it, I have to save you. You have too much knowledge and cuteness in you to bestow upon the mortals. Here’s what I’m going to do. I’ll extract a tiny bit of your soul; it’s no more harmful than taking a little blood. I’ll use that to convince the higher\-ups I completed the contract. Then I’m going to come visit you every day for good measure until I can figure out how to keep you. Sound like a plan kitty?”

The vacant expression on the cat’s face didn’t change, but some saliva dripped off of the cat’s tongue.

“That’s the most assuring response I’ve ever gotten.”

Death’s bony finger hovered above the cat’s head until a floating glowy substance came from the top of the cat’s head.

“That’s all I need. I’ll be back tomorrow kitty. I love you. Stay wise; stay strong.”

Death returned to his bedroom. He threw all of the soul essence he collected from the day into the red flames. The fire roared as Death got on his bed and stared at the ceiling. 

“That kitty… That’s a real good kitty.”

This was only the beginning of Death’s crush on a cat. ",kthoughtbubble

[WP] A cat so old and cute that death won't take it.,Zuberan,"The temperature of the room drops when I walk in. I've grown used to it. Just as he has.

He opens one milky eye and yawns, showing off rows of dirty teeth with a few noticeable gaps.

""Lost another one, hmm?"" I say to him, kneeling down. He stretches and I wait, he gets like this. This cat waits on no man or god but all shall wait upon him, for he is the most important thing in his life.

Not too different from any cat I've ever met.

He brushes up to the bony fingers, rubbing his grizzled cheek on the edge of my index. We have an agreement, he and I. For many, many, many years now.

I've heard the conversations people have about him, the ""fat one"" they call him. Except one family up the street that call him ""big gray"" and I don't know which is more rude to the poor thing. Never has their been a sweeter, more self-absorbed cat.

He purrs with the subtlety of a jet fighter. It rumbles through my bones and my teeth chatter. I snort a laugh and he rubs back and forth along my finger.

I let him have his fun. A few minutes later he stops and sits, licking on paw daintily (sprightly for an old man, if I do say so) and looking at me with those faded eyes.

I'm not sure he can see, really. I think he's just been around for so long that he memorized everything. Even our monthly visits.

Thirty one years, this cute little bastard has been bothering me.

""So, Can, how about it?""

I ask him. He lets out a low meow of distaste for the name I gave him but rubs against my finger again.

He's my cat as much as anyone's. He was in an alley, all skin and bones and barely breathing when I came to him. I held out my hand for him and he hissed at me. Not mean, mind you, just...sort of a ""bugger off"" one. Made me laugh.

Tough one, a fighter. He was the runt, left to die in the rain and cold and garbage strewn alley. Matted orange fur. Ribs sticking out.  No one could hear him through the rain and he was on the twelfth of nine lives.

I could just take him but...well it wasn't right. He might gouge bone if I tried to take him. And I am fond of my bones. So I kicked over a garbage can, little local restaurant.

They took him in, good folks. Henry, the owner, was supposed to have a heart attack that summer. He didn't. Small favors.

And here we are. Three decades later. Henry is gone now, I couldn't stop it twice. More than a few people have left Can's life. He's always stuck around, refusing to give in.

So I pop in and see where we stand. If he's still got fight or not. And we have a deal. I ask, he meows as if offended by the question, scratches himself some more and then goes back to the couch.

That's our deal.

Except...he isn't moving. And he looks at me, with those big eyes and that thick fur, and he meows again. Not offended this time.

No.

Not this time.

I kneel with him and I stroke his head and he closes his eyes and sighs.

""So...after all this?""

I ask him. He purrs and rubs into my bony palm. I clear my throat.

""Are you sure?""

His purring deepens. He looks at me and the gray fur becomes orange again, the milkiness in his eyes clears away and he leaps into my arms like a cat a fraction his age. He rubs his face against my chin as we stand.

I gently lift his body to the couch, rest him easy. It's small comfort to Henry's daughter, I'm sure, but maybe she'll find some peace that he went quietly.

He meows in my ear and clambers up my robe onto my shoulder.

""You'll love it, Henry's been waiting on your for a while. Keeps telling me to just take you.""

He meows.

""That's what I said!""

And we go on like this, as we always have.

As we always will.

I froze in place, mind racing as I felt completely numb. 

""Is everything alright?"" The stranger asked with furrowed brows. 

""Yes, it's just.. I think I left a light on at home. That's all."" I shook off the numb feeling trying to ease back into my normal  demeanor.

""So, you wanted to meet me for a floral arrangement? What's the event?"" I pulled out a chair for myself setting down my binder against the table. The stranger sat across from me. 

""I still don't know your name by the way."" I added opening the binder flipping through finding a blank page.

""Elliot and there is no event. I don't need your services. I need your help.""

My head shot up meeting his eyes. He was serious. How the hell could he be serious?

""What?""

""Look, I know what you do. I know you can-"" 

My hand shot up stopping him from talking any further. 

""If you don't need my services,"" I stood up closing my binder and setting it against my arm, ""then I'm going to leave. I'm not interested in any problem that you might have. That's your problem. Not mine.""

""It will be if you don't help me."" He snapped.

I scoffed pushing the door of the coffee shop open. The ground shook violently as the sky began to darken into a gold tint. Stop lights crashed down cracking concrete as cars screeched to a halt. People screamed and yelled as they begged for help as random strangers began to faint without reason in the middle of the sidewalks. Dogs howled towards the sky. A nearby cat hissed towards its owner and scampered across the street ducking under me into the coffee shop looking for a place to hide. 

I turned around, still holding the door open, seeing Elliot still standing there staring back at me.

""Do you know what's going on?"" My hand shook against the glass of the door.

He nodded.

I looked back towards the street. The dark gold tinted sky reflected across the street as screams and sirens rang in my ears.

""What do I have to help you with?"" I turned back facing Elliot.

He walked over to me every step echoing across the silent shop.

""You're helping me after that dramatic scene you just pulled? What a change of heart."" He taunted with cold eyes. He offered his hand once again.

Something was there with him, blocking the way. Every time he tried to continue on his way he found himself doubling back. The loops were getting smaller. The elevator was no good, he couldn't recall why.

Coach Zaragoza finished lacing up the boxing gloves and tied them tight. Once the officials gave the clearance, all there was left was to wait to be called. Anthony thought about where he was. A stadium in New Korea, full of hundreds of fans and family from all over the world, from all walks of life. Humans and non-humans alike here to cheer on the first Mutant Olympics. 

Anthony didn’t much care for the term mutant, but he understood the appeal. For a lot of people it became a term of endearment, for others they considered it hate speech. As such the name has gotten a lot of flack. But for the first time since the Mutated Gene was discovered, people with powers and physical “abnormalities” had a place to compete with their peers. Track athletes with super speed finally could show off and give their all, even if they sometimes tore through a wormhole. Power lifters and wrestlers with super strength or augmented features. Swimmers with various mutations like fins, webbed fingers, and even gills could finally swim openly. Many cheers and tears have been seen at this place. And now it was Anthony’s time to shine. 

From a small suburb in Ohio, to a boxing gym in SoCal. From a nobody to a multiple time golden gloves champion and Olympic qualifier. From hard beginnings and prejudice, to the gold medal match with fans in the stands. All of it seemed so surreal. He wanted gold more than anything, but wino or lose he felt whole. As he clenched his fists he felt his wraps and the leather of his gloves tighten around his hands. His heart, which had been erratic earlier, was beginning to settle into a nice rhythm. Anthony shut his eyes and took a deep breath. He felt a slight vibration in the back of his mind. 

“They’re about to come get us,” Anthony stood up, “let’s hit mitts a little more before they do.” 

“You’re plenty warm Tony,” Zaragoza said, “besides if they’re about to come get us that means they’re right around-“ 

There was a knock on the door followed the handle turning and opening. A sharply dressed man with a kind face stepped into the room. He wore an Olympic pin on his lapel. 

“Anthony Rialto?” 

“Benjamin Frost, “Anthony said,”  I’m ready whenever.” 

The man was taken back. 

“How did you,” Benjamin started, “oh! Oh right, right. You’re the precog fellow.” 

Anthony hummed in response. He bounced back and forth on his toes. His legs felt like they were on fire. His arms did too and his hands felt light and fast. 

“That must help a great deal in a sport where you’re liable to get hit.” 

“Still get hit. Just doesn’t happen that often. Kinda hard to dodge punches completely when a guy’s got four arms.” 

Benjamin nodded and then motioned for the two men to follow him. Through the hallway and into a corridor that would lead to the ring. Standing at the edge of the corridor he paused. There was a glean in his eye. For a moment a smile showed on his face. 

“Whatcha grinning for,” Zaragoza asked, “you see yourself winnin?”

“Right now, all I see is a hell of a fight. Can’t see the ending right now, wouldn’t want it that way, but this should be fun.” 

The three began to walk down the corridor. The closer they got the more he could hear the crowd. The cheering, the chanting, the chatter. Through his minds eye he saw everything happening all at once. Like a flood of information passing by at an alarming rate. The movements of individuals in the crowd, the next words they intended to speak. All it once it seemed overwhelming, but then there was the calm. He walked through the end of the tunnel into the arena. And the crowd went wild as they called his name and country. The chants of ‘U.S.A’ mingled with calls for Cuba. 

This was where he belonged. Where his mind could be at ease. Standing in the ring across from only one opponent. With just one sole focus to put the totality of his power towards. That’s when he was the most calm. Pitted against adversity. ",laughmaker_son

"[WP] It is common to see a portrayal of the stereotypical emotionless alien being taught how to love by humans in the media. However, when we make first contact we soon learn that, by their standards, we are the emotionless ones, and they want to fix that.",Isabonny,"""**I WARNED YOU!**"" Brian yelled, advancing on the alien ""doctors"", his body covered in gore. ""**I WARNED YOU HOW DANGEROUS UNCHECKED EMOTION IS BUT YOU WOULDN'T LISTEN!**""

Brian never considered himself a very aggressive man, he'd much rather buy someone a drink than punch their lights out, but apparently to these invaders, that was a sign of 'extreme emotional repression'. They were so over-emotional that even those loudmouth Yanks were seen as downright robotic, so a Brit like himself was public enemy number one.

The abductions were sudden, they teleported people into their 'treatment' facilities on their ships, restrained, and started pumping people with god knows what, claiming that it would ""allow us to truly feel"". Brian, and others among him, struggled to escape. ""You can't do this! People just cause death and destruction when they get too emotional!""

The invaders didn't listen and got exactly what they wanted, raw, un-restrained emotion. Rage burned white-hot in Brian's mind and his body, unfettered by higher thought, ripped the restraints off the table. Before the aliens could even begin to react, their subjects had lept upon them, ripping them apart tooth and nail. The invaders were too shocked to even consider defending themselves.

Once the room was cleared, the intense heat of rage gave way to the slow burn of hatred. These aliens took away our minds, so we will take everything from them. ""Rip and tear.""",Xifihas
"[WP] It is common to see a portrayal of the stereotypical emotionless alien being taught how to love by humans in the media. However, when we make first contact we soon learn that, by their standards, we are the emotionless ones, and they want to fix that.",Isabonny,"Roger Burton takes a deep breath and straightens his tie before stepping through the door onto the White House front lawn. Roger, fluent in nine languages, a dabbler in a dozen others, seasoned diplomat, and former Secretary of State, knows this is the most important assignment he had ever been given. He is going to be the first official contact between the United States and an extraterrestrial being.

The ships had first come into view six days ago. A message had followed just moment after, in sixty languages, asking for diplomats to meet at various locations around the globe. Of course, there were security concerns, and the president and every other major government official is ten miles underground in a bunker in Montana. But Roger, he is expendable.

He smiles at the thought as the spring sunlight hits his face. He walks out onto the grass and looks up at the ship. Suddenly, two...creatures stand before him. ""No."" he thinks to himself. ""I cannot consider them creatures. I must think of them as people."" That is not an easy task, when they are both twelve feet tall, shaped like upside-down ice cream cones, and a color somewhere between brick and eggplant.

Roger just stares in stunned silence, until a voice comes at him, seemingly from nowhere. ""Roger Burton. It is wonderful to meet you! You are the most incredible being we have ever seen!"" the voice is positively...joyful.

Roger is taken aback by the strength of emotion dancing in the voice. He composes himself, and steps forward. ""Greetings. Welcome to the seat of government of the United States of America. Our people welcome you.""

The aliens are silent for a moment and then a voice full of sadness drips through the air. ""Roger, why don't you like us? What have we done wrong? Oh...if only someone better than us had been sent to meet with you. We are so sorry!""

Roger Burton briefly considers if there could be some sort of translation error going on here, but he has no idea how this communication is even possible, so he decides it's not worth him spending much time thinking about. ""No, I am sorry if I gave you that impression. I am most pleased to have been chosen to meet with you. Perhaps I am not conveying myself properly.""

The voice again fills the air. ""Do you really like us Roger? Because you are showing us no emotion. Are you well? We can detect no joy, no hate, no love, no excitement. In our people, that is only possible if there is extreme illness.""

Roger smiles slightly. ""Well, we would except there to be some differences between us, wouldn't we? I can assure you that I am honored to be meeting with you. And I am not ill in any way. I have plenty of emotions."" He puts his head down as he remembers the fight he had with his wife just this morning, when she tried to talk him out of this meeting.

There is a pause, and then the aliens speak again. ""Tell us of your shows of emotion. And, please tell us why you don't seem to show any emotion toward us? We consider it most rude!"" The anger in the voice this time puts his anger towards his wife to shame. He lifts his head sharply to study the aliens, but they have not physically moved since their arrival, at least not in any way Roger can detect.

He clears his throat, calming himself, and carefully chooses which stories to tell. He talks about joyful events, like his wedding day, and the births of his three children. He talks about sadness, recounting the deaths of his parents, and his eldest daughter's battle with leukemia. He talks about excitement, remembering his graduation from Harvard and his first assignment as the Ambassador to Japan. He deliberately never talks about anger. The whole time, the aliens are silent, presumably listening. 

When he finishes, the voice resumes immediately. ""Oh Roger, those stories are wonderful. But, we do not see real emotion in them. We wept, and laughed, and shudder with envy at your stories, but you did not. You feel nothing even at your own greatest and worst moments. We suspect your diagnosis of illness is incorrect. We think you are, sadly, severely emotionally damaged.""

Roger does not like the sound of that at all, and the tinge of the voice was bordering on unhinged. ""I did not agree to this meeting to be insulted. I am a highly successful and stable person. I have been happily married to the same woman for fifty-three years. I am sad for those who deal with emotional disorders, but I have never struggled with mental illness. Mental illness in our people comes in the form of crippling depression, sometimes so bad that a person cannot get out of bed. It comes in the form of bipolar disorder, where a person swings from elevated mood to low mood. It comes in many, many forms, and it is often successfully treated medically.”

The next spoken words from the aliens come with a definite sound of shock. ""You medicate the people amongst you who actually have strong feelings? That's barbaric!""

""They do not simply have strong feelings! They cannot control themselves. They require help."" Roger uses every ounce of his experience to bite back his frustration.

""Poor, poor humans. It is all of you who need help. Don't worry Roger, we will fix everything."" 

Before he has time to react, a beam lances out of the one of the beings and pierces Roger Burton's forehead. He can almost feel a pulse, and then a snap in his brain. Suddenly, the world opens before him. The birds sound so much...happier. A slight breeze tickles his skin, and the pleasure is one of the greatest things he has ever felt. He staggers backwards, bumping into a column, and turns in rage, snarling at it. He falls to his knees, overcome with a storm of feelings.

""Roger. We love you. We will teach all humans to love just as you now love.""

Tears of gratitude flow from Roger's eyes, as he shouts, ""Thank you! I have never known life like this! You are my savior...you are my gods!"" Roger tears his shirt in triumph, ignoring the feeling of his seventy-two year old heart about to give out, of his blood pressure bursting forth into aneurysms. 

""You are welcome, Roger! Now, quickly, you must tell us where your leaders are, that we might heal them also.""

Roger gladly tells them what they ask, even as the blood flows into his brain and his speech slurs, even as his heart races his brain to destruction. Roger can feel every bit of it, but his only joy, now, is to help these aliens free his people.

For Larry's part, he was aware that the smile was... insincere. But Jamilorax had asked so nicely, his mandibles shuddering in anticipation. Those weird, unsettling hands with the three long fingers and six joints \(two double joints, so he could hold objects on either side, woof\) were on his shoulders.

Jamilorax's black, shimmering eyes became opalescent. ""Yes, yes, Larry of Boise! Yes! Oh!"" One hand left Larry's shoulder and swooned across Jamilorax's long forehead, just beneath the plume of feathery, blue antennae running along his head. ""You're learning so quickly! I am beyond proud.""

*I can smile, you nut,* thought Larry. He poured the smile on a little thicker. Mostly, he wanted his La\-Z\-Boy. Alsura Neptulon was an interesting spot to orbit at first, with its green acidic clouds and shining ivory cities that towered into the atmosphere like spires of glass.

Now, they sought to teach him how to smile more. How to frown more, how to be *their* idea of more. It was less than idyllic for Larry, who gave himself a black eye on the kickback from his father's six\-shooter as a boy. In a profoundly charitable act, his unrelentingly cool poppa had tossed a steak out of the fridge to quell the bump and calmly taken the gun away before going back to smoking tobacco on the back porch. Not a word. Not a worry.

That was childhood. Adulthood. Larry's idea of manhood. Emotions were a marker of the weak.

Apparently, this principle was frowned\-upon \(literally\) by every form of intergalactic fauna.

Jamilorax's life\-bonded, Parysynthia, entered the room.

Jammy \(that's what Larry called him in the journal he'd been forced to write about *feelings*\) began to cry anew, seemingly overwhelmed that his mate had not been sucked from an airlock since she left the room 5 minutes ago.

They embraced. His proboscis, located in a flap of skin just beneath his neck, stretched out and wrapped about hers. They hummed a high tune for a moment, which left a residual chime in Larry's ears.

""Any progress?"" she asked.

""He has *smiled!*""

Parysinthia burst into tears of joy.

Larry rolled his eyes. Ten more days and he'd be home with a pocket lined with their currency. The exchange rate was good. He could get a new La\-Z\-Boy.

Then, he'd have no need to sign up again.",StanWrites

as our drunken hero flounders in,

bedless hair ragged, beard untrimmed,

eyes bloodshot and mind swimming,

his fertile worries sprouting wombs

of an endless agonising war inside,

each thought breathing life into another.

He sat down on a wonky iron chair

and slammed his aching head down.

The bartender, unflinching, grabbed

a glass, wiped it squeaky clean, 

let it clink before the rundown man

and poured his finest raw in a trickle.

The hero let out a helpless sob,

caught in his actions of villainous murder

and downed the glass in one.

He did not speak a single word

as he slapped his coin to the wood,

stood up and stumbled to the door,

a hazy memory of lovers long lost

the only grasp he had of his life.

And off he went, back out to fight,

while the bartender waited alone,

wondering if the next muddy step

would be the final one.

"[WP] Humanity is actually god's fever dream that he forgot he made real. We are utterly terrifying in every way to the Angelius and Demonicius, the other two species he made. Humanity has just made first contact.",Vaperius,"The elected representatives of Angelius and Demonicius had organised an emergency interplanetary conference following the most disturbing of days. Angelius had received an open transmission from the third species, one that both had hoped would never become advanced enough to find them.

Angelians and Demonicans rarely consulted with one another due to their species’ differing temperaments, but this was of importance to everyone and they had made an agreement many years ago that should this day ever come, they would decide their plan of action together.

Humanity’s inter-species greeting was a painful reminder of their intellectual limitations and their archaic and horrifying physical forms – with a series of prime numbers and allegedly advanced mathematical formulas, followed by diagrams depicting human figures and their intent of 'peaceful' exploration and the search for “fellow intelligent life”.

The notion that humans thought of themselves as the intelligent life-forms of the galaxy was almost laughable, if the Angelians and Demonicans hadn’t been so preoccupied with the concerns that they might actually turn up, they may have spent hours poking holes in the supposed sciences that they humans had sent within the greeting.

But given the alarming nature of the conference, no such fun was to be had.

The Angelians were strongly of the view that both planets should halt all transmissions for the time being, raising defences to ensure that the abominations couldn’t discover their whereabouts and hope that the broadcast couldn’t be traced to any who picked it up. Judging by the contents of their greeting, Humans couldn’t be that advanced – the information sent was extremely rudimentary and was likely transmitted with the blind hope that someone would pick it up and be stupid enough to make contact with their doomed planet. 

The Demonicans on the other hand, were far less willing to risk the notion that the Humans might come looking. They had sent a probe to “Earth”, or whatever they had called the unfortunate wet rock they currently resided upon and it seemed that it was currently in a state of extreme distress – no planet could have gotten itself into such a foul situation without the extreme neglect of the resident species. They could only assume that the Humans were looking for a new home – a life raft from their current sinking ship.

They wanted to suggest an offensive approach to the situation. Humans would never survive any attack from either of them and would rid the galaxy of their plague before they condemned another planet to their idiocy. They appeared to have already started spreading to a barren red planet, but this would be short-lived. Their systems would fail with very little interference necessary, they relied upon resource shipments that appeared to be sent from Earth, arriving every other of their planet’s orbits. If they had really chosen to colonise that unhappy rock, they evidently couldn’t get very far.

The Angelians were not so sure. The little information that they had gleamed from the myths of Humans painted the picture of a sadistic and unreasonable species that almost enjoys meaningless aggression and acts in blind ignorance for their own self preservation. This wasn't a species they wished to ever chance in combat or even direct contact.

Whilst they bickered back and forth with ever increasing tension, they were suddenly cut short as notifying signal was sent to each of them from their ship – a new incoming transmission –

“…Err… Hello? This is Admiral Pasher of the Absolution. Do you read?”

Humanity has just made first contact.",Vaperius,"Niles Felix looked up from the wires, circuit boards, and electronic displays in front of him and realized he was alone in the research lab. Everyone had gone to lunch, but he had been so involved in his work that they had left without even asking him, and him without noticing.  This didn't come as a surprise, because Niles often lost himself in his work, so he took the gesture as a kindness and picked up his coffee cup before walking to the front of the room where he stopped in front of a giant dry erase board.


At the top, ""LONG RANGE TELEPORTATION - TRIAL #65"" was written in ink that had long set and would be difficult to erase at this point, with dirty smudges surrounding the trial number as it was erased and re-written every week. Niles scanned the rest of the board, which was a mixture of formulas, diagrams, graphs, and a drop-dead date for when their lab ran out of funding. Teleportation already existed, which had helped humanity establish a research and military base on Mars' two moons, Deimos and Phobos, but if there were to be any chance of exploration -- and supply lines -- outside of the local solar system, there needed to be teleportation technology with a longer reach.

Niles took off his glasses and took a sip from his cup, which made him grunt and purse his lips at the surprisingly cold coffee. Frustrated, he walked over to the small test chamber beside the whiteboard. The test chamber was a glass box about the size of a refrigerator, with a single metal platform in the center where he set down his cup and closed the door. After so many months of failed trial after failed trial, seeing small objects explode within the test chamber  was a much needed moment of entertainment for the team, whos morale often needed the boost. 

Niles lifted the plastic cover on the On/Off switch beside the chamber and gave a smirk before flipping it. The lights dimmed in the room as the chamber pulled energy. However, instead of the cup being obliterated, green energy filled the box, then blew open the door with a deafaning electronic roar.  In an instant, everything as a blur then a new, completely unexpected room jumped into existence around Niles.  It was well lit with artificial lights, but that was the only element of the room that felt familiar. Everywhere else, curved metal tables and screens displaying completely foriegn writing told him that he wasn't anywhere near his old lab.  It only took a moment before he realized there were other figures present who leaped away from him in surprise.  

""What in the --"" Niles started to exclaim, but was cut short as he was tackled hard from behind and wrestled to the ground, his glasses flew from his face and bounced away from his reach. The other figures franticly shouted at eachother in an unfamiliar language, more figures darted this way and that, opening containers and rummaging around. Niles' vision was blurry, but he could make out that the figures running around and holding him down were almost human looking, yet they radiated a soft glow and had feathered wings, which were tucked back with straps that were sewn into their uniforms.  Niles squirmed and struggled to take a breath so that he could speak. ""Hey! It's ok!  My name is Niles.. Niles Feli-AAARRGGH!!"" A sharp pain interrupted cut off the remark as one of the figures standing on top of him jabbed a device deep into his ear canal. Niles ears rung like a bell had gone off inside his ear drum, then as the ringing subsided, muffled voices of the others in the room faded in and to his surprise, he could understand them this time.


""How did that human get here?""

""He just teleported in!!"" 

""From Earth?""

""Who knows! But he teleported right on top of Forkis!""

""Shit! Poor Forkis.. what a way to go..""

""Stupid creature! It has to pay for this!""

""Wait, we need to figure out how he got here first.""


Teleported in?  On top of.. someone named Forkis?  Niles craned his neck to look back at the spot he stood in before the other creatures had tackled him.  On the floor there was a pile of gore and bone that seemed to spread outwards in every direction, like a watermelon that had been struck with a hammer. Unfortunately, this type of incident was a known danger of teleportation technology, which made their production use highly regulated. 

The two beings pinning Niles down lifted him to his feet and faced him towards a particularly imposing male figure, who slid the eyeglasses back on Niles' face and looked at him sternly. ""My name is Vox. You've got a lot of nerve, human. First one of your marines attacks our Demonicius allies on Phobos then on Hell, now one of you shows up on our home world? I'm just glad we caught you before you could cause the level of destruction we have seen even one of your kind capable of.""

Niles blinked. ""Our.. Space Marine? I don't have any idea what you're talking about.. we lost contact with one of our military bases some time back, but we chalked it up to a disaster. Another expedition is on the way there right now to investigate, but it's taking months.  I've been working on a teleporter technology so that we could travel much quicker. He's attacking your allies? Who are you? What are you?""

Vox reaches into a pocket on his uniform, then brings up a data pad and taps on a few corners, then turns it towards Niles to display a video feed of one of UAC's marines.. sure enough, charging through the corridors of the Phobos research base, running, yelling obscenities and firing a shotgun at what looks to be demonic monsters. 

Niles looked back and forth between the video feed and Vox.  ""Allies?  But you look to be.. forgive the expression.. angels.  And the creatures on Phobos appear to be demons.""   Vox shook his head, showing obvious dissapointment. ""We are familiar with your books. This is not the afterlife. We are not your protectors. The Demonicius and Angelius are not enemies.. we are perfect creations living in harmony both on our own worlds and within the galactic organization.  You humans can't even live in harmony on your own planet, and emissaries from our worlds to establish contact only sent your species into confusion and speculation, which divided your people even further.""

Angels and Demons.. are real? And they are just other species in the universe?  Humanity is not alone. Not only that, but a long standing religion on the planet may have misinterpreted a visit from another people!
Just as soon as that revelation sunk in, the room burst into green energy, followed by the familiar deafaning roar of teleportation.  There Niles was, standing back in his old labratory where a startled-looking janitor retracted his hand from the switch on the portal chamber, and coughed out a snickers bar, nearly choking on it.

----------------------------------------------------

In the following months, Niles tried to spead the word about his discovery with humanity, but was taken for a fanatic who had cracked under the weight of work pressure, and was looking for a last bit of relevance after his research lab lost funding, costing everyone their jobs. His career came to a premature end, and he was quickly forgotten in the professional world as a disgrace and a quack.  Years later, living on the streets, Niles blends in with the rest of the bums, scraping for change on the street corners.

""Hey, Bum.""  

A tall man stood over Niles, now slouched against a building with unkept hair and a beard down to his chest.  Niles didn't respond, and stared straight ahead, looking across the street at nothing in particular.
""You... Bum. You hear me? I'm looking for the guy around here who used to say Angels and Demons are real, but are just other people like you and me.  Are you that guy?"" The man kicked at Niles' foot, trying to get his attention.
""I don't know who that is, man"" Niles said flatly, ""but what the hell does it matter anymore anyway? I don't care.""
The man stood in silence for a moment, then dropped a quarter at the sidewalk by Niles' feet.  Niles watched as the man walked down the street a ways, stopped, and placed a package in a corner, and pulled a latch on the side. 

The sound of a thousand tug boats blowing their horn at once filled the air, and a green explosion ripped across the street, closing the gab between the buildings where the package sat with a huge green teleportation portal. In an instant, demons started pouring out of the portal, immediately opening fire upon everyone in sight. The city block quickly transformed into a scene of panic; people screamed, ran the other way only to be gunned down, some got tackled and torn by pink monsters with horns, or blown up with rockets. 

Niles lept up from his spot on the sidewalk, jumping up and down in delight.  Through the explosions and weapons discharge, he could be heard over all the commotion yelling over and over again:

I was right!

I was right!

I was right!

[WP]You live in a world totally different from ours. Tell us the cosmogonic myth of your people.,cynferdd,"In the beginning, space was infinite and all things were spread out and none of them touched and none of them had a name. In fact there was an infinite amount of space between any two points. An infinite amount of time had passed, and points began to come together. They met and created the 12 basic shapes. The shapes came together to create the 48 compound shapes, and from those shapes came people, and people named themselves. People were spread throughout the cosmos, but we did not worry, because space was shrinking. As we got nearer to each other we could begin to shout across the void, and the ideas we shouted became colors. Friendship formed into anti-blue, and hate into blue. Friends became closer, not only in space, but also in ideas. In the progress of history, anti-blue is stronger than blue, friendship wins out, and in the end we will all become one.

[WP]You live in a world totally different from ours. Tell us the cosmogonic myth of your people.,cynferdd,"The spider god spends each day traveling across the sky, rebuilding his great web. Doing this requires a great amount of energy, so by the end of the spider god's journey he begins to shine less brightly until he fades away. Once he is gone, great demons foolishly believe it is safe, and begin to try to invade the earth. But fortunately the great web cannot be seen by the eye and the demons become caught and entangled in the web. As the night progresses, more and more demons get caught in the web even including up to three greater demons that are capable of taking different shapes from the lesser demons and even eachother. The demons continue to attack the web begin to damage and break the web. When the web has been weakened to a certain point, the spider god feeds on the demons and he begins to grow bright again. Once the demons have been eaten and the sky is bright, the spider god once again travels the sky rebuilding his web.",CurseOfTheBlitz

""You get 1 chance a year for 100 years after your death choosing a single medium to work with eg.

You must beat them or else your artistic skill will forever be forgotten after the 100 years. You are judged by a pannel of famous artists from whatever medium you choose to work with they can come from any time period even future ones but you are meeting the afterlife versions of them so you could have a person from 8 billion years in the future that was famous for using the art medium you choose or someone from the past. Judges for the medium are winners of this contest or artists who died already famous who worked with the same medium.""

I guess I know that I can't force you to stay

And if you think about it, at the end of the day,

Maybe we just aren't meant to be


See I'd buy you diamonds or M&amp;Ms

I'd stay by your side, again and again

I'd really love to say that it's us versus them

But maybe it's not meant to be


I said I'd be fine with you walking away

Because we both know I can't force you to stay

But I think you should know, at the end of the day,

My thoughts drift back to you


I guess now we're headed down different paths

If I'd known before, it'd make me laugh

We made the plans, we did the math

And my heart's in your carry-on


And now I know you've gone away

You're in a different place, and there you'll stay

But just so you know, I dream of a day

Where you remember what this was

And maybe you'll return because

I belong with you

Colonies can live on ships for generations unseen and unknown, or have a mutually beneficial relationship with a crew.",xChipsus,"By now you might not consider this species human. Now, that word doesn't exactly carry with it a connotation of dignity, but it might have at some point in time.

The species of human was not originally so animal, but as time went on and they adapted to a new surrounding, they found themselves acting in a much less becoming manner. 

Of course, you know humans as the disgusting pests that infest seemingly every spaceship and city in the Intergalactic Republic. They spread disease, breed rapidly, and live off of our trash.

Humans come from a tiny, barely noticeable planet called Earth, which lies in an insignificant corner of the Milky Way Galaxy. As you might be aware, parts of the Milky Way were sanctioned off by government decree to be a nature reserve. It was only once some limits were removed that people were allowed to explore the area in more detail, and that was when someone noticed a small planet swarming with tiny creatures. These adorable little things had created a surprisingly complex society of their own. Being no more than a tenth the size of an average person, this explorer took several of them and put them on display. They quickly multiplied. Ever heard the phrase ""breed like humans""? 

Little did that explorer know that he would forever change that species. 

The caged life is a poor fit for the spirit of the human, and hundreds eventually escaped. They spread quickly throughout our planets by finding our spacecraft to be very suitable homes. Eventually, their scavenging lifestyle led to them being hated and feared by us. They reacted by shirking from our contact and retreating to the shadows. 

I write this to make people more aware. The human was not always a pest. It once was part of a sophisticated colony, not like the ones we see now. The human moved from a world where it had no predators, to one where it was merely prey. 

So, next time you encounter a human, think of how it might not be such an animal if things had turned out just a little differently.

That opens up more options for communication between the two sides as groups, not a direct one to one like in Horton.

Today was finally the day I’d do it. I grabbed my pistol, and tucked it into my waistband, pulling my shirt over the handle. Stuffing a ski mask in my pocket, I opened the door to my trashy apartment, and stepped out into the street. A couple of kids from a local gang swaggered by as I started walking towards the liquor store. As I approached, I heard yelling coming from the store. Tugging on my mask, I tried to peek through the windows, but the grime and tint made it impossible to see inside. 

I pulled my pistol out, and stepped through the door. Standing right in front of me, pointing a shotgun at the owner, was a large man in a mask identical to my own. “What are you doing here?” he demanded in a gravelly voice.

“I… uh. Fuck.” I turned and ran, swinging open the door and taking off down the street. Ducking into an alley near the shop, I stopped and waited. A few minutes later the man stepped out, and walked my way. Pressing myself into the cement walls, trying to hide in the shadows I shuffled towards the street. Passing by the alley, the man pulled off his mask. I hit him on the back of the head with the handle of my gun, and he collapsed to the sidewalk. Grabbing the bag of money he was carrying, I ran down the alley and onto another street. No one did more than glance at me, crimes were frequent in this neighborhood, and people knew to look the other way. I flew all the way back to my apartment, slammed the door and locked the deadbolt. Panting, I dropped the bag of money on the floor and my hands shook as I went through the cash.

""Six hundred and one million, eight hundred and fourteen thousand, nine hundred and eighty three years, two months, and ten days,"" replied the human captain of the ship. ""We were thinking that would be pretty standard for species travelling between galaxies.""

""Uh... no,"" the tall, humanoid arachnid said, brushing his chelicerae as though it were a beard. ""I've never heard of anyone travelling in a spaceship for that amount of time. I've never even heard of a *species* that even lasts for so long before extinction. Did your FTL drive malfunction? I'm so sorry you had to be on that ship like that.""

""FTL drive? Are you serious? Those don't exist, do they? The reason we were on the ship for so long is because we have no other way to travel through space. We have biologically engineered ourselves to be immortal.""

""Immortal..."" the arachnid's eight eyes blinked and stared upward. His imagination ran wild. Immortality was something that the universe's most advanced races had long forgone as a fantasy that could not be achieved. Even the longest-lived beings only made it a few centuries with the most advanced medical technologies and dieting practices. The Council would be shocked beyond their wildest dreams to learn of this development. A species supposedly much more primitive had somehow cracked the code. And they had done this because they couldn't build an FTL drive? He had many questions.

Coming back to reality, he noticed that the humans had begun to argue and shout at each other. They had become rather embarrassed and angry that they had developed such a slow and impractical way of space travel. The arachnid loudly clacked his fangs together, and the humans quieted down. Turning toward the captain again, he began to speak: ""Sir, I am baffled as to why your people seem to be disappointed in their oversight. On the contrary - you have created something far beyond an FTL drive - far beyond *anything* the universe has ever imagined! You are truly a race worthy of being placed on the High Council for your achievement. What is your name, captain?""

[WP] You feel alone in your new home and decided to buy your own pet. You went to the pet store and there it was; A baby Cthulu for only 5$. You bought it,JhayAlejo,"Day 1:
He had a annoyingly punchable face. It brought up serious questions about where the hell I was.

“Do you believe that nature is unchangeable?” He mutters, dark blue eyes sparkling with contempt.

“What?”

“I said, DO YOU BELIEVE THAT NATURE IS UNCHANGEABLE?”

“How is that relevant AT ALL?”

“Just answer my damn questions.”

I put the squid thing back on the counter. The door was looking very tempting, sitting over there, away from this guy.

“Look, *friend*. I don’t want this thing. I don’t know why you’re asking me personal questions.”

He sighs obnoxiously loudly and I resisted the urge to fight. “Fine, take him. That’ll be $5, *please*.”

I take my impala and drive back to the apartments, calling Hunter on the way. “What the hell, man. What is this thing even supposed to be?”

Hunter sounds... surprised. “Dude, he actually sold it to you? I was in that place for an hour and he refused every single person. I was just messing with you.”


Day 2:
The thing doubled in size since yesterday. Not pretending to be a squid scientist, but I’m pretty sure that’s not supposed to happen.

I’m back at the store and the same dude is still working. He stares at me as soon as I enter, ignoring his current customer entirely. His customer starts to wave in his face, but he just ignores her. He just sits there, waiting for me to speak.

“That tank is WAY too small, man.” I say, and his face scrunches in disgust.

“It doesn’t matter. The tank won’t fit him for very long. He doesn’t really need it.”

“What kind of squid doesn’t need water”, I asked.

“My squids don’t need anything, thank you very much.”

I think I’m just beginning to realize what Hunter got me into.


Day 3:
It’s now the size of its tank. Four feet by two feet and moving angrier every day. I don’t really know what’s going on, but at this rate I would love for the thing to like me rather than kill me when it grows larger and breaks out.

I put some music on for it and fed it twice as much as I was supposed to. It looks just about as happy as a disgusting massive squid monster can look, so not very different. 


Day 4:
My google searches for winged squid aren’t showing up with many results and it shattered its cage in the night.

After spending a couple hours cleaning up its mess, the squid actually seems pretty friendly. He makes a good pet and lays on your lap like a cat or small dog. I’m kinda getting to like him.


Day 5: 
I swear his growth is speeding up. Yesterday he was the size of a coyote. Now he’s close to the size of a wardrobe. 

This is not an okay turn of events. I went back to the pet store, but the worker refused to even look at me. I don’t know what that means, but it can’t be good. 

Pretty soon the squid will break out of my apartment and start destroying something. I can’t even bring him back, either. It’s not like people would react well to seeing a squid walking around on the streets. I don’t know what to do.


Day 6: 
The entire fucking building is in ruins. Crushed by that stupid squid. It killed everyone except for me, for some reason. The bodies are gone without a trace. I suppose I would be arrested for murder, if only the cops hadn’t reported a gigantic flying octopus in the sky instead.


Day 7:
My entire town is enslaved by Cthulhu. It’s been a nice life. We’re all dead, but at least its beak looks pretty cool when it closes around the groups of people to swallow them whole. I’m up next, and he’s too big to recognize me. I’m such a proud father. ",QuantifiableMistake

This best act of kindness will be my last tonight  
With one fell swoop, I'll cut through this horde  
And finally put an end to this fight

My entire life has been nothing but pain  
Keeping my strength in check has been such a drain  
But I get to let go, get to sever the cord  
And see the fireworks bloom in the pouring rain

The target, at first, was the control room inside  
Bodies slipping through corridors as I seek to hide  
For only a moment, until the coast is clear  
Then, to the controls, I move with a purposeful stride

Autopilot is dismantled with a single blow  
The ship starts to tilt, pulling the beings in tow  
I smile and turn around to face the voices I hear  
As they speak in a language I don't care to know

Their tentacles lash out and make cuts in my skin  
The pain was so bad, a lesser man would give in  
But my anger was unmatched on all of Earth  
And so I rushed forward with a murderous grin

Flesh torn asunder, blood spattered the walls  
Several tried to flee as I chased them through the halls  
Destined for destruction have I been since my birth  
But, at least, I'd save the planet once this spaceship falls

On my way to the king, I destroyed what I could  
Punching through metal, ripping circuits, breaking wood  
My journey for salvation was nearly complete  
This will redeem me to them; surely, it should

The throne room was large, with no end in sight  
Ruler seated in the middle, under warm light  
His speech was human, tinged with a bit of Elite  
I didn't care to listen, I was here for a fight

So, we battled and caved in the spaceship's hold  
I lost so much blood, I began to feel cold  
But, I won in the end, collapsing onto the floor  
I guess I won't live long enough now to grow old

My eyes close as explosions surround  
Alarms blare in the distance, I can barely hear the sound  
I drag my body as far I could towards the open door  
And thrust myself over the edge, hurtling towards the ground

I watch the ship explode from my cradle in the sky  
Tears well up and part from my eyes  
Beyond, in Heaven, I can see them look down  
Soon, I will join them; this is how I die

Though the world hated who I was for my power  
I was their saving grace in their darkest hour  
And as I was quietly lowered into the ground  
I looked down upon her as she lay a flower

She stayed with me for what seemed like hours on end  
Of all the ones who faked happiness, she'd no need to pretend  
She'll carry on in my stead, and live her life in peace  
And never know that I did this all for her, my only friend.",ywuiadr

The deeper you go the weirded the altars get and the more forgotten the god/goddess is....,TheNariel,"In the holy city of Tiancles, gods test their champions.

Every potential champion must complete the crypt diving ceremony on his 15th birthday. The test is simple, dive into the Great Crypts, a never-ending spiral of caverns that continue to challenge potential champions with even more dangers as they continue. We do not know if their is an end, but no champion has come back from the bottom.

It is well known that the shrines within the Great Crypt move. Some say the Great Crypt help the gods from being forgotten, some say it chooses which gods are forgotten. Most of the gods on the surface are weaker than the ones below, perhaps this is their way of searching for worthy champions. After all, in the city of Tiancles, gods test their champions.

Now it is my time to explore the Great Crypt. As I pass the surface gods, I think of their names, what they represent. Poiso the fishing god. Diance the party god. The dangers are real, even on the surface. I watch my every step, knowing that down here, it could be my last. Every few steps I stop to cut the string of poison dart trap, or deftly avoid the tile that sticks out a bit to far. 

GRGUNCH

Before I even feel my foot sink into the floor I roll to my left, desperately hoping to avoid What I triggered. The bladed pendulum cuts my legs as it passes, but the wound is shallow, and I can still continue. After bandaging my leg with the sleeve of my shirt, I press on even more carefully, stepping lightly. My journey will not stop here.

Why am I even doing this? What patron will satisfy me? I know not what my destiny will be, but I refuse to live a carefree life of a menial worker. What will constitute passing this test in Tiancles, where the gods test their champions? There it is just ahead of me, the stairs descending to another level.

Down here the statues show patrons of the human condition. On my left there is a heart themed and decorated statue I recognize as being Philos, goddess of love. A little bit ahead and on my right is a ferocious wolf statue, Benine, the god of vengeance. But I harbor no hate in my heart, nor do I want to live for another. I will need to dive deeper for my patron. Ahead of me lies a monstrous beast still in slumber. It resembles a rodent, if they could grow twice the size of a man. Now is when I must bring out my weapon of choice, the halberd. There is no way around it, and even if there were, would my future patron condone cowardice? I steel myself and slowly draw a deep breath, and while holding my breath and stepping as lightly as I can approach the beast. It's eye, the size of my head opens and stares right at me 10 feet away. No time for stealth now, I swing my large weapon up on my soldier, preparing to swing as it charges me. It shakes off it's grogginess and closes the distance. I swing down with my whole body. The ax blade of my halberd hits the skull, but it is no good, the monster charges into me and I fly 10 feet back from the impact right into a wall, but I keep hold of my halberd. The monster roars it's pain from the wound. I groan mine as I stand. Here it comes, this time stopping short just a hairs breath shy of ax blade. It stands on its hind legs and claws towards me. I dodge below the swipe stepping into it and pushing the spear end of my halberd as hard as I can into its abdomen. It is not time to ponder the damage done, I lay flat on the ground, letting the handle of my halberd rest on the floor as the business end falls deeper into the creature, as it's own weight pushes it down onto the weapon. It roars it's pain as the creatures movements slow...and then stop. As I free myself from the weight of the creature, I can't help but thank my lucky stars for the victory. 

Right behind the creatures corpse is another set of stairs. Looking at the decorations on the walls of this floor, I realize these are all gods of cosmic forces. ahead of me and on my left is the statue of auran, the lord of space. Far down to my left I see helimod the sun god, flanke by lunada of the moon and sabos of the north star.  

As I walk down the hallway, I am assaulted by a wave of searing pain in my head. Every step brings another wave of indiscrimanate pain. I will keep moving until I can't stand it anymore and whatever god will have me at the end shall be my patron. I step slowly, doubling my conviction with every step, and with every step comes another wave of slightly more pain. After 100 steps I can barely keep going. I keep my eyes only on my feet, if I stop to look at the statues then I will not be able to continue on. Another step and I fall and scream from the pain. I can continue. I crawl another few steps, screaming and crying. I reach out vainly, and my hand rests on a boot. I feel the coolness of it. I can feel the burning subsiding, now a wave of coolness flows over. This coolness is coming from whatever my hand has touched. I open my eyes and stare at it. The boot belongs to another statue, but I do not know this one. It is of a man in golden armor, with eyes that look down at the world. The armor is not part of the statue, but it is a set of armor put on a man sized statue. I see it now, this is to be my patron. I can feel his presence in this lifeless statue. The suddenly a voice in my ear.

The deeper you go the weirded the altars get and the more forgotten the god/goddess is....,TheNariel,"I wearily looked up and realized that I had reached the last altar in the endless darkness. I was in the Hall of the Ancients, and by the custom of my people I had been sent here to choose a champion god to bind my allegiance, life and belief to. This practice had continued since time immemorial, with every man and woman delving into the Hall at the cusp of adulthood. However, unlike the rest of my people I had never left. When I had first arrived in the Hall, I had walked among the altars eagerly, searching for one Immortal that which I felt I could serve faithfully. With every step, I came upon the altar of some new deity, some creature which had shepherded humanity through the annals of time, for fidelity or slaughter. I saw statues of deities of the Sun, resplendent in their robes of pure light, of Earth, giving life with one hand and taking it away with the other, and of every natural phenomenon in the universe. I also saw those of human concepts, like cruel War, neutral Justice, and surreal Madness. It was among these I was expected to pick my champion god, but I couldn't fail to notice that there were more gods, stretching into what seemed like eternity deeper into the hall. So I continued walking. I beheld god after god, deity after deity, until they lost their names and become...primordial. I passed altars to rocks, pieces of bark, and drops of water, mundane things that had inspired the imagination of early man. However, there had always been one more altar at the edge of my vision, one more god to witness. So I continued walking. I walked through the hall, until my body grew stronger and then weaker, until I was simply an old man shambling through the eternal darkness. Now, I had finally reached the end of my journey. I stared at the last altar, devoid of any statue or diety upon it. And then, I began to understand. A laugh escaped me. I had spent my life been looking to dedicate my life to a God, and in doing so I had done just that. Behold my master, Nothing, he who which man had created the Gods in fear of. ",Itakecookies

I wondered if the spectators from the outside were still there. I’ve been here, what? Hours? Days? No, it can’t be days. But the deeper I went the more it seemed that time was beginning to become a diluted construct. Surely *someone* must have heard the crumbling of the wall that had lead me thus far. Then again, this is a supposed joyous occasion, so focus and hearing don’t often coincide with the roaring cheers and deafening music. 

“This is insanity. I should have simply picked one of the favored gods and gotten out quickly”

But I only said this aloud to calm myself. Truth is, my curiosity had gotten the better of me. And was apparently the driving force behind my expedition into the deep. This area was locked away. Built around to keep us participants of the trials out of whatever this area is supposed to be, so one has to beg the age old question. 

*Why*?

Progress forward was only met with more questions. Statues of what resembled regular men and women of our people. They did not look divine or spectacular but like simple warriors and scholars. No grand armor or weapons, no beautiful heraldry, just, simple. Plain. 

“If these people are supposed to be gods then what’s stopping me from becoming one too.” 

And suddenly I heard a giggle. Like a child playing outside with a stick. 

“A bold and daring question my boy” 

And my torch went out. 

“Who.... who’s there! Who said that! And why are you here!” 

“Why am I here? Why are *you* here, let’s start with that. This is my tomb after all, or crypt if you’d like to be technical. And I don’t remember inviting guests over.” 

“I... I’m... well, I’m exploring!” 

Our people are brave. Courageous. Forthright. And here I stood in total darkness, palms pressed against a cold wall, feeling as if my legs at any given moment could collapse on me. This is supposed to be a crypt! A place of only dead bodies! Nothing is supposed to be alive here and yet a voice is speaking to me. 

And then the room was illuminated. The once unlit torches now shined fiercely with bright yellow flame. And I finally saw the room at it’s full. From the hallway I entered I finally saw what was a... room. 

A simple room. With a simple tomb. 

“Marvelous isn’t it? Such minimalism.” 

And finally the voice was associated with a body. A tall man with hair grey braided backwards. A scruffy looking white beard and a face that looked, worn. Multiple small scars and bags under his eyes. But, he had a smile on him. A genuine smile that radiated life. He wore a regular old shirt that you’d see on a farmer working in the field with pants to match. And he was barefoot. 

“Such artistic vision captured in so little. It is truly remarkable.”

Weapons were not allowed during the entering of the crypts. It’s a sacred place. Of worship. But at this moment I wish I had something. That smile wasn’t fooling me. 

“It’s alright child. Despite my remarks earlier, it is actually a delight to see someone in this dark below. Allow me to introduce myself to you, my name is Ker. A shortened version of an ancient name. One you would not comprehend, though I say this with no offense to you.” 

My bravery was coming back to me. After finally being able to put a face to the voice, it was no longer phantom. And I wanted answers to my hundreds of questions. 

“Where am I?!”

It was more of a demanding request rather than a polite question. 

“Ah the young, always firing questions. You are, as I have mentioned earlier, in the hall of my tomb.”

“If this is your tomb, why aren’t you in it?” 

“Well the people who created it never found my body. But created a tomb all the same. For reasons that are really beyond me. It was apparently a symbolic gesture. One to avoid the wrath of the gods and all that. But I quite like the aesthetic.” 

“Okay, but.... who are you? Or better yet, *what* are you?” 

“I am a god.” 

“A god of what?”

“A god of wh- oh that’s right! Your people now have gods for the individual aspects of life. Hah, that does make me laugh. My dear boy I am simply a god. I do not rule over the skies, oceans, or hell for that matter. I’m much too ancient for that and far too preoccupied. As were my friends who you saw down the hall as you came in.”

Hundreds of questions became thousands of questions. I had to be dreaming. There had to be an explanation for this. None of this was making any sense. 

“I understand that this may be puzzling. But I didn’t break that wall ‘accidentally’ just for you to faint due to being overwhe-“

“If you’re a god then.... why are you dressed as a farmer! A peasant!” 

The torches flickered and the ma- gods voice changed from calm to commanding and booming. It wasn’t anger. But I would be lying if I said that the change was not unnerving. 

“Armor does not make grandeur. Weapons do not make the coward brave. The younger gods whom your people adopted are purely symbols of materialism. That to be deemed valuable and worthy is to shine like the sun. To be noticeable. But those gods are nothing compared to us. The deeds of the gods of old have been long forgotten. And when people do not need protection against higher powers, they forget. Only in times of distress do they begin to fall to their knees and pray, remembering the ‘beings of creation’ as we are called in their books and scripts, because they can not take care of themselves. I called you here for a reason because you are not of these people. And calling back to your questions posed to yourself earlier,” 

*”what is stopping you from becoming one of us”*

The torches continued to flicker. And the god, with his hands behind his back stared me down with his piercing grey eyes. 

“I should be getting back. The people are surely worried.” 

“You’ve already been wandering here for days. What’s a few more.” 

The god said with a very soothing yet sarcastic tone and a wave of his hand. 

Days?! How?! 

How did hours become days? If I’ve truly been here for days then wouldn’t there be someone looking for me? Despite being overcome with nerves I couldn’t help but feel immense intrigue. The god was mysterious. His stature and presence created significant amounts of urge to know more. 

Reluctantly, but filled with curiosity all the same I replied, remembering; 

“Fine. I’ll stay and listen to your story. After all. This is supposed to be a joyous occasion.” 

The god smiled. His previously endearing lips curled upwards like dry branches during a bleak winter.

[WP] Write about your favorite D&amp;D moment from the perspective of the characters.,Wizelf402,"Miles from home and family, and in a never ending system of caves.  I had never met a Human before.  Now I am weary of them.  They sent me down here for one reason or another.  I suppose giving a reason for your actions is uncommon among humans.  My race had only recently arrived in this realm, many races have called use aberrations.

As I traveled along the tunnels searching for a way out I heard a noise.

""Who is there?"" I screamed frantically.

""Your mind is strong."" Came a low growl.  I turned to its source and saw a creature that appeared to be made of thick bones with a massive exposed brain that ran down through its spine.  After seeing it a hurled a rock at it with my telekinetic abilities and ran down the tunnels.

The chase lasted for a good while.  I would toss rocks at the creature as I ran, and it would do the same.  I was so happy to have taken care of children for so long in my home.  It was easy to navigate the uneven ground of the tunnels.  I soon ran into a group of individuals that aided me in the defeat of the creature.  Though, I was not welcomed at first.

""Alright who are you?"" A small human asked, with a weapon pointed at me.

""My name is Amaterasu, and I am a Psigan that was sent here by a human with no explanation.""  I answered.

""Next question,"" a human with pointed ears said ""Why are you naked, save for a few decorative baubles?""

""Because my race can regulate our body temperature to a great degree.  If it were cold as a tundra I would wear more, but as it is I do not need clothing.  Also I lost the dress I was wearing when I was sent here.""

""Are you an enemy?""

""I want to go home, so I'm only an enemy if you are against that.""

They weren't, and they invited me to travel with them.  They had explained that prior to our meeting they attempted to defeat a Beholder.  I decided to help them, as they needed the eye for a ritual to stop a demon invasion.  I didn't know what they were but I was told they are what was chasing me.  Scary thought, more than one of those beasts.

After some preparation we went to fight the Beholder.  The only thing I could do was conjure up a giant snake of an astral construct.  The snake wrapped around the Beholder and blocked its central eye.  Allowing everyone else to kill it.  After it's death one of my new human allies tore out the eye of the Beholder, and we descended to the bottom of the chamber we were in.

At the bottom of the chamber we came across a verity of creatures that were being enslaved by the Beholder.  They looked hungry, and remembering that one of the humans boasted the ability to create a great amount of food and water, I asked xyr to cast the spell.  After which I was seen as a savior, or at the very least a 'motherly figure'.  Don't know what that means, but I also told them of a large set of weapons and a safe house they could use.  My allies were slightly annoyed at how popular I was, but they did tell us about a treasure vault we could haul off.

So as the small army marched off looking for the arms my allies left behind, we prepared for the next leg of our journey with the help of a small mechanical creature.",Olimar92
[WP] Write about your favorite D&amp;D moment from the perspective of the characters.,Wizelf402,"There was a spike of intense pain and then there was nothing. Just white light. I couldn't feel anything anymore and even my body felt weightless. Upon opening my eyes I found myself lying on a marble floor. I was in a hallway and one that seemed to stretch on forever.

I was able to pick myself up and get to my feet without any trouble where I discovered Eckhart already standing beside me. He was looking out toward three golden thrones while a knot was forming in my throat. I began to question what was happening.

*Am I dead?*

Torm, Tyr, and Ilmater soon appeared sitting in the thrones before us. I knew them well only from the stories Eckhart shared. Tyr spoke first and addressed their cleric while my head began spinning as I didn't understand anything that was going on.

*If I am dead why am I here? I'm a wizard and I don't belong here! I shouldn't be dead! I wasn't ever supposed to\-\-*

My attention snapped back to the Triad when I heard them beginning to speak of the Soulmonger and then a lich by the name Acererak.

*Acererak.*

A pang of jealously overcame me which then left me feeling fearful. Vulnerable.

*They know why I came to Chult. I'm here to be judged.*

I wanted to scream and runaway. I wanted to make myself small. I wanted to become invisible.

Eckhart approached me and put a hand on me. He looked content and warm and all I could think about was how he would never see his family again. His final words will forever haunt me,

""Return and do what you know is right.""

*I\-\-*

*What* is ""*right?*""

And with that he was gone with the gifts the Triad had given him. Eckhart was to continue on a spiritual quest to save the souls caught by the Soulmonger. I was now all alone with the Triad. Three gods who must be able to read my mind and know the lies I weave and the barriers I put up and my desperation for\-\-

""Natali.""

They used my false name. Was he patronizing me or did they truly not know?

It was the bleeding god who approached me. His steps seemed strained and he was leaving a trail of blood as he moved forward. I focused on him and noticed that the blood that came from him quickly melted into gold. And that face of his was so gentle and so kind. The fear that I had only moments ago and the offense I had taken at hearing my false name all vanished. Ilmater's eyes took me in and I listened to the words he spoke.

They brought me here with Eckhart to return to the others with the knowledge they gave us and the comfort that Eckhart, in one sense, would be okay. That even though Eckhart was dead, he wasn't truly gone and was still helping our cause from the ""otherside."" And then he told me that the Triad would continue to watch over us and they would continue to speak to us, but instead of Eckhart it would be through me. And I wondered...

*Why me?*

I gasped.

The blood from Ilmater began flying at me, hitting me in the chest and with such pressure that it felt like the wind was taken from me. I wanted so desperately to yell and scream out to the Triad to tell them my real name.

Instead. Intense pain returned to me.

I opened my eyes and found the druid over me looking deeply concerned. I felt alive, but in so much pain that for the first time *ever* I actually wished I was dead. I took a look at myself and saw my wounds were still bleeding, but bandaged. A cure spell Umak gave me did little in closing them up. I began shaking and I finally cried out feeling so much pain.

I was suffering.",Anibunny
"[WP] The day you have been dreading for the last 20 years has come at last: that moose is at the door, and he wants answers.",adlaiking,"I knew this day would come and yet i was still surprised when he finally arrived. He was big, far bigger than i could have ever imagined with fur as black as the blackest night. His antlers rose to the sky like towers, ready to rip it open if need be. The Horned God, Cernunnos had arrived, he is there when all things are born and he is there when all things die.

“Why do you hide from me? You do not need to be afraid” The Horned God asked. “I have been looking for you and it has been no easy task”.

I said nothing.

 “I am here to return you to the earth child” His voice was soft and warm yet there lay a great power behind it. He continued “You were made from this land and it is time to give back what was given so new life can take your place. It is how all things are, the cycle of birth and rebirth”.

I knew it was my time, my body was old and broken from years of hard work on the farm. “I do not want to go! I am not ready!” i yelled. I was always disappointed that i did not rise above the rest like some do, leaving no mark on the world, doomed to be forgotten. “Why now? I have done nothing of worth in all my years, it would be cruel to take me now!” i protested. “I know your fears but they hold no truth!” Cernunnos replied. He sounded hurt but that couldn't be it, why would he care. “Your words bite me like the point of a knife, for you are blind to everything you have done and that saddens me. You have spent your life growing food for your fellow men and women, sustaining your community. You have provided safety for your children, given them the gift of education and most importantly loved them. You may not be remembered by all men but that does not matter, you will be remembered by your family, by those you have fed. They will remember the selflessness of a man who sacrificed his body so they could live. You have made your mark and a great one at that”.

His words hit me like a hammer. I wept, not tears of sadness but of joy. Cernunnos had opened my eyes to the truth which was a gift with no equal. The Horned God knelt down and said to me “Come now, it is time to go. Climb onto my back and rest your eyes, your journey is finally over”.

“I am ready”.

"[WP] The day you have been dreading for the last 20 years has come at last: that moose is at the door, and he wants answers.",adlaiking,"I broke open the door, ready for my punishment. 
Closing my eyes and wincing in anticipation and ready for the worst.
 Yet, nothing happened. As my vision slowly gained clarity I saw the moose. Unyielding at my porch. Then it, well, it spoke. 

""Nyomy"" said the moose. 

""For many years have I felt your suffering from the depths of the spirit realm.

Your guilt has eaten up your life and your relationships have been spoiled.

 I have come here to let you know, that I and all of moosedom forgive you. We are at peace and I was drunk galloping that day, it was my fault. May you live the rest of your life to the fullest.""

Then the moose evaporated into thin air leaving just a glint of blue light. A light that manifested itself in the now outstretched palm of nyomy. 

It was a ring engraved with a name and some numbers

""One dollar? One thousand? One million?"" Even with whatever ethereal form of communication this being used I could detect confusion.

""No. One year. I want one year. What is one more year of my life worth?"" I don't think Death was prepared for my counter offer, but then again I wasn't prepared for the God of Death to knock on my door like some polite elderly neighbor and offer me this deal like that same elderly neighbor pitching a Tupperware party.

""That's not a currency."" I wasn't sure how I was so calm, but it probably had to do with the unholy amount of caffeine I had consumed. 

""Clearly it is, to you at least. Or is it a good? Produce? Am I aisle seven at the godly Walmart?""  The small and ever dwindling voice in the back of my head that served as the rationale part of my brain had been shut off hours ago. Thirty-five mindless, droning essays that held about as much substance as air and final grades due in three hours. 

Death snorted, which I wasn't sure how. There wasn't a nose present, or a face. The whole lack of an exposed skull was disappointing. 

""Look, I just want to know the exchange rate. And frankly, I don't have time to barter here. What is one year of my life worth? Whatever your offer, I take it. You said I couldn't say zero, and the idea of instant death does sound appealing, but I have some things I would like to finish. Like grading these essays."" There was a pause after I had finished whatever verbal vomit had poured from my mouth.

""Maybe I should return when you are sober..."" This time I snorted, a sound of desperate laughter.

""I'm perfectly sober, and entirely in my right mind. I promise you I know what I'm saying, or the general idea at least. The extra words are garnish."" I sat back down at my desk and squinted at the screen, trying to find my place in the sea of typos and vapid meaning that this eighteen year old had clearly pulled from some crevice on their body. Another lengthy pause.

""One billion...?"" The confusion was amusing, but I didn't have time for games.

""Seems like a low offer, but I can do a lot of good with it. Honestly, a single shiny penny would have worked. I'm not old or sick or anything. Just tired. I wanted to make a difference but when I have the money I don't have the time or vice versa and frankly I'm kind of done with life. I don't want to die, but I'm tired. One year and a billion bucks can do a lot of good. I mean, I have so many grand plans, and not a whole lot of money or time.""

There was a further pause, much longer than previous ones. I almost thought Death had left.

""One billion per week, whatever isn't used by Sunday at midnight doesn't roll over. You have one year from Monday, and are not allowed to explain this deal nor mention it to anyone. There will be no goodbyes."" I nodded.

""Seems good enough. I do have one request. I can't say goodbye or explain this deal, but I need to find someone to take my pets. I won't just leave them."" I nodded to the St. Bernard curled around the nine pound kitten. Death paused again, but the answer was quick.

""We will make sure they are taken care of."" I nodded, that answer seemed to fill me with confidence. It was weird, but I felt like that was the most secure part of this deal. 

""Great. Time to change the world... And grade some essays."" I felt Death leave, but not without the faintest murmur of a comment.

“So you’re the God of Death, right?” I asked, still rubbing the sleep out of my eyes.

“Yes, I believe we’ve been over this a couple times,” the hooded man in a black cloak said, clearly impatient. “I offer a certain amount of money in exchange for a certain number of years in your life. You can tell me how much money, I will decide how many years from your life. I will kill you on the spot if you anything below or equal to zero.”

“So let me get this straight,” I said after a short yawn as I sat up. “I can ask for money.”

“Indeed.”

“And you’ll remove years from my life according to how much money I ask for.”

“Correct.”

“And if I ask for anything below or equal to zero you’ll kill me now.”

“Yes.”

“And that’s it?”

“That’s it.”

“Great!” I said, jumping out of my bed and stripping in order to change so I could go to work. “I’ll just not answer.”

“What do you mean—“

“Our agreement has three clauses regarding this deal and no time limit,” I answered before he could finish. I quickly grabbed my tie, tying it up tightly. “So it’s fine if I just don’t ask, right?”

“Wait, that’s—“

“All right then!” I said cheerfully as I grabbed my suitcase. “Time to head out for work!”

I opened up the suitcase and pulled out a folder. The folder read “Target Information”. And idea clicked in my head as I read through the folder.

“Hey, how about we make a different deal?” I suggested to the now depressed God of Death.

“Yeah?”

I smiled brightly in the face of Death as I spoke.

“What if I offer you lives in exchange for money?”

Death smiled back.

I’m sorry. I’m sorry I left without saying goodbye, but after the last few years we’ve had with each other I needed to leave. I’m cowardly for doing this after thirty years, but after the death of our son and your recent prognosis I couldn’t bear to look at you on a daily basis anymore. It’s not you or the situation, it’s me. I’m crippled with fear living with you knowing you only have a finite amount of time left in the world, and it scares me. 

When we first met thirty years ago, I told you I was afraid of death. You told me it’s a silly thing to worry about since we can’t control when we die, we do what we can in this world and die. Yet I’m reminded of death frequently when I’m with you. Your mother passed away shortly after we got engaged, your father soon after that. Our terrier got ran over by a car after a few years of living with us. A stillbirth. And when we finally had a child, he was taken by a drunk driver shortly after his 12th birthday.

After each brush of death in our lives, I grew more terrified of dying. The reason why I fear it is because I won’t experience it as long as I stay safe. I won’t die through old age. I know I say I won the gene lottery, but it’s true. I don’t age. For me to stay alive though means I need to stay safe. This is why we never went out of state, rarely leave the city, and never lived anywhere close near the city because I’m afraid sooner or later death will find me through some freak accident. This is unfair to you. You don’t deserved to be locked up in my own prison.

I’ve transferred some money into your account. What I’ve taken from you can’t be replaced, but I hope the money will give you the opportunity to cram 30 years of living in 5 years. I can’t possibly know what you’re feeling, but know I feel horrible. You’re a stronger person than I am, and for that I envy you.

But I don’t want to die. I don’t want to be reminded that there is such a thing.

When the smoke cleared youthful innocent me just stoos there unnaware of the trajedy and nightmare he just created. 

""Mum?"" I said a tear running down my young face. I refused to watch it a second time but i couldnt look away. There she was in the back wall of what was left of the kitchen a wooden wall board stuck through her stomach or rather almost vompletely cutting her in half. This is how it started this is when i lost all feeling or at least buried it deep inside not to come out for centuries. 

The scene evaporated like sand in the wind. Except there was no wind and there was no sand beforehand or afterwards. Then something else started to form in the thick fog. It was a silhouette and another and another. They kept coming, faces i recognised and faces i didn't all crying or in pain or angry. They all stared at me not saying a word just kind of looking intently at me actually at my chest. I stared to glow. The glowing souls started to exit my body leaving some suck awful feeling behind. Each soul stopping above one of the sad peoples heads. This happened for hours slowly crippling me. 

Once the souls stopped leaving i was able to stand still in awful pain, but able to stand. As i looked into the crowd of sad people every single one of them had a sould above them as far as the eye could see. There was even one above my head. All the people wispered something into their soul and one by one thwir sould shot back into me, and when it did the person would disappear.

This process was much shorter but infinitely more painful i looked up there was one more person, but instead of wisper to a souls like the others he walked up to me. It was him the empath.

""How do you like empathy?"" 

""What have yoy done insect?!""

""I have given you humanity. What have YOU done?""

He then whispered to his soul and it crammed its way into my chest like all the others. 

I woke up on the ground all my men around me. I look at them but i di nit see them nor anything else. ""Hello?"" One of my men walked up to me i could hear him but j could not see him.

""Sir you've gone blind we're taking care of you""

I quickly understood why thia was the case. Then something weirder happened, I cried. No man has seen me cry not for at least 700 years but I wept and could not stop. I wept and the fog returned in my mind i saw the first face to come from the fog, and i heard him whisper.

""Tenth grade, the woodchipper"", I remembered he is where I got my regenerative properties. 

The next came up, ""Last year, charge of Stagrlon""

Person after person came up to me their faces the only thing i could see. The only thing to tell me a time and a location or a way or anything that would let me know exactly how they died. This seemes like an eternity, but when I came back to it had been less then a second. I felt them i felt their pain. I remembered more every second new faces with times like ""twenty five seconds ago"" or ""just now"".

I feel more then their pain i feel their suffering, their fear, their feeling of abandonment, their feeling of worthlesness. It had to stop, but how? This guilt, this empathy ate at me like a lion tears at the flesh of a dead gazelle but also like a mouse nibbling on cheese. Slow bit massive chunks takem from me. Who was I? Why do i do these thing? Why did it all turn out this way? ",Deanyeah

Something I craved. I craved the power to do as I wished. And so I took it. I took all of it. The power to fly. The power to heal. The power to be completely invincible. I took it all, and made it mine. And I laughed. Oh, did I laugh. To watch the now powerless struggle against me was truly a joy. I was a god among men. No. Less than men. Less than the smallest ant against the glory of my power. There was nothing I could not do. Nothing I could not take. Not even Death himself could stop me.

I lined up the supposedly ""gifted"" like so much cattle. Taking every last bit of power from them. Speed from that boy. Strength from that girl. They belonged to me, after all. I permitted them to live. What good is a god without those to worship them? Perhaps these powers would amuse me for a bit. I doubted it. I had not seen something new in close to a millennium. And yet... Perhaps that child, with the terrified look in his eyes? What did he possess? I shall take it from him regardless. Oh? That was indeed a new power. I... feel? I feel the hate of those surrounding me. I feel their fear, their disgust. I feel their sorrow, their pain, for all that I have done to them. It is... an assault of emotions upon me. I can feel every little thing that I have wrought upon these souls...

And it is delicious.",Malzun

One day you steal powers from a super-empath, causing you to feel all the suffering you have wrought.",truffle15,"I could absorb powers. It was what i was good at. It was how i became the best in my field. I was the best super in world, to date. And i got here by taking the powers of others, and using them to help me. I started small, slowly toppling cities, and taking control of them. I slowly absorbed more and more superpowers as my reign grew bigger. Within a few years, i started toppling governments, and becoming the ruler of countries. As i did more research into how my powers, i found out it was in my blood. My DNA and Bio electricity was how i was absorbing the powers. My Bio electricity could take a sample of my opponent's power, and there was something in my own DNA that absorbed strands of DNA or parts of that strand that my body seemed beneficial. 

There i was, going out for another day of 'Murder Mystery' where i would find people's power, and take them. I had finally found another power i was looking for. An empath, someone who could sense what other people was feeling. If i could get that power, i could get more power's easier. I could sense what they were feeling, what their weakness was, and then take their powers. 

After tracking the empath's house down, i waited till nightfall. No need to have a full on fight, I just needed a very slight amount of my bio electricity to touch them, and it didn't matter if they were awake. 

It was close to midnight, before i tried going in, and shocking them. I sneaked into their house, and searched for their room. After a near minute of searching i found where they were sleeping. I quietly shocked them, with what must have felt like static shock. My brain felt a rush and warm tingle go across it. My body had accepted the DNA, and i knew it was only minutes before my body would collapse, and start rewriting my whole genetic code. I quietly sneaked back out, and hightailed it back to where i lived. 

It seemed like a dump on the outside, and nobody noticed it, but the inside's where it really shined. It had an elevator to a basement, filled with the latest and greatest technologies available to me. When you secretly ran the world, with people on the lookout for you, for the destruction caused, it paid to have good equipment. 

As i made my way to the basement, my vision started tunneling. I had around a minute before i collapsed. I started to feel slightly dizzy, as i stumbled out of the elevator. I started walking over to my bed, which i put close to the door for this very reason. I collapsed, and slept, for hours. 

Finally after 12 hours, i woke up again, with my body able to sense people's feeling. My brain instinctively able to turn it on and off at will. I went and grabbed the hangover remedy that helped rid the jitters, headache, and nausea that came with absorbing people's power. I slowly make my way outside, and flicked on the empathy. I was instantly bombarded with suffering, pain, and hatred. People seemed to be loathing with what seemed like an intense focus on me, and nothing else. I staggered and quickly turned it off. The mere seconds of exposure to that, left me mentally tired, and weary. 

I went back into my house, and stayed inside for days. I had always thought i was doing good, helping people, by getting rid of the evil in the world. Helping them by removing regimes, and other types of governments that oppressed people. It seemed that there was intense hatred where there should have been appreciation, friendliness, and love. It was true. You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain. I had become the villain, while i thought i was the hero. I couldn't keep doing this. I couldnt keep going down a path where people hated me. I need to rectify the mess i made of myself. I will leave the face of this planet, and hope that everything turns out for the best.

""I should be asking you that question."" Fate replied dryly. ""I found him like this. Fix it or there will be... consequences."" He said, emphasizing the last word.
""Y...yes my lord."" I stammered.
Fate shook his head disapprovingly before fading away.

The wretched fool sat at the bar, talking to a local whore. His usually clean shaven face began to wear the beginnings of a beard that unfortunately never complemented him well. His brown hair was as disheveled as his eyes were red. Breath reeking of alcohol and something else I couldn't quite put my finger on. Shirt stained with food and drink that had fallen astray during the drunken journey of reaching his mouth, even worse was that some of it likely did make it in but didn't agree with the booze. Yet just a few days ago he had been one of the most respected men in the whole town. He was to be married to his childhood crush in less than a week, but now he carried the engagement ring in his pocket. I could only guess where he had driven his fiance off to. I can fix him up real quick, just give him some time to sober up and realize what he has done. Their relationship would be more difficult to mend without intervening directly, as that was against the rules. But they loved each other, so I still have a fighting chance. 

I dawned the appearance of the local rabble. Wearing clothing that would both blend in, and make sure no one could recall any specific details about me. I walked through the front door and quietly made my way over to the drunkard. 

""Come on friend, it's time we leave here."" I said calmly to him.
""But I don't wanna go, I'm having so much fun here."" He replied, each word growing exponentially louder than the one before. 
""Fine young lady,"" I said turning to the whore, ""would you excuse us for just a moment?"" 
She turned and walked away.
""You're a mess, and it's time you go home."" I once again told the man. And before he could speak, I tapped his forehead gently, pacifying him. I wrapped my arm around him and led him out if the bar. After a long walk we arrived at his house and I put him in bed. I sat on the floor exhausted. Using a mortal form and keeping him in the pacified state simultaneously was more than I normally ever did at the same time. The rules typically prohibited me from being so affecting the world so much at one time. But they bent themselves in my time of need. Now all I need to do was figure out how to get his fiance to come back to him. And quickly too, before Fate grew impatient and decided take his anger out on me.",CurseOfTheBlitz

I haven't played in a hundred and twenty years. A quick glance and I can see that the table is the same, but the material the ball is made from has changed. It's a heavier, black polymer. There's slightly less bounce to it. Still, I pick it up quickly, and it's obviously that it isn't going to be much of a game. There's no fun to winning easily, and a lot of risk.

“Shit, you are pretty good. When was the last time you played?”

Dammit, I just can't help but want to win. I smash the ball over the table and against the back wall to throw a point. John ducks out of the way just in time. There's a black mark left against the white wall, about two inches to the right and three inches above the dartboard.

“Oops.”

“So you can be beaten, hey?”

The mark is still there.

“I guess.”

I win the next couple before I smash it again. Same height, but two inches to the left of the dartboard this time.

“Hey, no need to be aggressive, buddy.”

“Sorry, again. You're pretty good.”


A third smash, then a fifth and a sixth. All under the dart board this time.

“You on tilt, hey?”

“A little.”

“Wanna make a bet? You're obviously better than me but I think I've got you rattled. fine How about a new game. Winner buys dinner.”

I've got the money, obviously, but I don't like losing. Do I start playing properly?

“Fine.”


Three more into the wall, but they are the only points I drop, and it isn't enough. I'm one away from winning and I have to make my decision. I smash the ball. Straight down, onto the edge of the table where it bounces at an odd angle and hits the wall one last time.

“Bugger. Maccas do, then?”

“I won't say no to any free meal, you know that.”

John comes round and smacks me on the back, “thought I had you for a moment.”

“Sorry,” I say and look over his shoulder as we walk back up the stairs. The dartboard makes the perfect nose to the smiley face. It was a pretty good game after all.",DocCannery84

""Uhm,"" I responded apprehensively. ""I'm not the best dancer...""

""Oh c'mon Jimmothy! It will be fun! Plus I'm sure you're fine at dancing. Hell, you're great at everything!""

""Hah, thanks Ryan. Uhhh.. um. Okay, fine.""

The date had been set, 3 days from now. We were to meet at the park where our friend Damion's mom would drive us. I decided not to practice dancing for in the early 20's, I had mastered the Jitterbug and the Lindy Hop. I was a world class dancer. I'm sure those traits would carry over.

Wednesday, June 30, 2018. The day had arrived. I left my home and walked to the park without touching a single crack on the side walk. After a short 4 minute stroll, I arrived.

""Hey, sweetie!"" Sharon called from inside her minivan.

""Hello, Mrs. Stevenson,"" I replied.

The automatic door sprung open and I hopped in. I didn't say much during the car ride to the club for a couple of reasons. One, I thought it was odd that Ryan's mom was driving us even though we are all 22 and 21. And secondly, I feared that they would find out.

It wasn't long before we pulled up to the club. We waited in line outside of the club. The thumping of the music was audible from outside. When we greeted the bouncer, I charmed him into letting us in. To my friends, it seemed like I cast him under some sort of spell.

We walked through the door. The pulsating hip hop remixes coursed through my brain. Without thinking, my moves busted out. Wowing my friends, I attracted onlookers with my stellar moves. I was unstoppable.

""DAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNCEEEEE COMPETITION,"" the DJ chanted.

*Oh no*, I thought.  I lost control and fell to the floor.  Explosively, my stellar dance moves transformed into radical break dancing. I weaved in and out of my arms with my legs and hopped onto my head on which I began to spin on. I saw the faces of completely awe struck on lookers. From my head, I back flipped onto my feet. A hype circle had been formed. Not again. I caught a glimpse of Ryan. His face seemed white. But that didn't stop me. I danced and danced and danced only to be stopped by the DJ calling me out.

""THE DUDE IN THE WHITE T SHIRT, SICK MOVES!!!!!!! YOU WIN!"" the crowd erupted in excitement and carried me to the front of the club. The DJ tossed me a trophy, which I caught with one hand. I held it up proudly as I continued to surf the wilderness of the crowd. I eventually was set down onto my feet.

""What the fuck Jimothy!?????? How the hell are you such a good dancer?""

""Ryan, I uh. Uhhhh... took dance lessons the other day..."" A feeble attempt of an excuse.

""Fat chance, something's up. And you need to tell me now.""

""Okay okay,"" I said. ""The truth is..""

""Yeah?""

""I... have been alive for centuries and back in the 1920's I was the best dancer in the world. I have had so much time to practice everything that I am super good at it all. Also I don't think I can ever die..,""

""What the fuck?"" Ryan said in disbelief.

""ahahaha"" Ryan and my friends chuckled quite hard.

I was breathing heavily at that point. ""Good one, Jimothy."" He sighed. ""I guess we'll never know why you're so damn talented.""",MizzMaam
"[WP] Your friends keep trying to get you to engage in various activities. Kicker: You are an immortal with centuries of practice at everything except failing. Winning reveals your true identity, and you are running out of excuses...",EqualWrite,"“You’re such a piece of shit!” Layla said to me, throwing a marshmallow over the campfire.

“Please just let me win once! Have you no pity for anyone?” she continued to joke. Although I knew there was a hint of truth in her statement. She was sure that Layla was wondering why, after 15 eventful games played today, that I never let them win even once. 

The thing is, if it was Layla who was winning all these games, then maybe the rest of the group would have been fine with it because everyone understands how outgoing and competitive she is. I, on the other hand, am the more reserved person in the group, and winning everything just looks like I am trying to prove a point to everyone else.

I was relieved, however, that we were finally done with the races, the breath-holding competitions, and the endless skillful games ranging from archery to paintballing. We were now all huddled around the warm campfire making s’mores to end the night.

Tomorrow I will be home and away from the mortals for a while. Tomorrow I will think of a plan to draw less attention to myself. I need to be more tactful, because the sly excuses I continue to give are catching on.

“Okay one more game!” shouted Layla.

“Fuck no, I’m sick of games,” said Dylan throwing his tree branch to the ground.

“No just truth or dare! No one can really win this game,” she exclaimed.

Daniel nodded at Layla’s suggestion, causing his curly brown hair to flop forward. At the sound of Dylan’s groan, Daniel laughed a strong laugh causing laugh lines to delineate across his strong jaw.

“You first Ascia!”

“But…I don’t want to.”

“No, you’re definitely going first!” Layla insisted.

“Truth or Dare. Oh, but you can only choose dare.” Dylan chimed in.

I rolled my eyes and waited to hear some unimaginable task they wanted to put me up against to test how human I really am.

“Dare,” I said reluctantly.

Layla eyed me with her rich blue eyes, then glanced at Daniel.

“Make Daniel fall in love with you.”

Oh no. How is that supposed to even pan out in a matter of minutes. The disappointing thing is that after I even lay a finger on Daniel, he will instantly be mine. That idea isn’t the worst in my mind, only it won’t be a sweet youthful love that lasts as long as summer break. Rather, I know he will persist to gain my love for the rest of his life. I have been through that many times before and I can’t put poor Daniel through it. I want him to live his best life.

Layla seemed persistent on having me complete this task, so I went over to the log where Daniel sat and looked into his brown eyes only shortly. Don’t look too long, I thought to myself. I quickly leaned over and pecked his cheek. I felt Daniel tense next to me, then he breathed out.

“Okay he doesn’t look in love, but whatever. Next. Dylan!” Layla said.

I couldn’t hear Layla and Dylan’s conversation because the only thing I thought about was how Daniel reacted. He hadn’t turned around to face me and exclaim his undying love for me. He hadn’t even returned the kiss, which was unlike anything I have ever seen. This did not normally occur. Had I failed? Failed for the first time in my infinite life? 

I turned to look back at Daniel, trying to find anything in his face to indicate what just occurred. He stared back at me. And then I knew. I knew that by being with Daniel I will be able to fail and lose and win eternally.

I ordered Papa John's already! Talk tommorow!""",cameronlcowan

You were a dentist.",HiImNickOk,"The concrete path drew closer and closer, so close that I could make out the spiderwebbed cracks and haphazard dandelions. 

And then I blinked. 

My heart was still racing, and my screams still echoed in my throat, but the light of downtown Chicago had suddenly been snuffed out. 

I was shrouded in darkness. 

*Ahem*, came a voice. 

A figure stepped before me. It appeared oddly anthropomorphic, save for the fact that I couldn't *quite* focus my eyes on it. Sorta like if you took an eraser to a pencil sketch of a human, blurring all the smooth edges. It spoke to me, but even its voice seemed garbled and distorted. Then again, maybe that was because I'd just fallen several stories *smack* onto downtown Chicago concrete. 

""Say what now?"" I stammered.

""Are you ready?"" the thing repeated. ""It's time for your test.""

""My....?"" 

I tried to rack my mind back in order. I'd been drunk. Dancing on a Chicago rooftop during my daughter's wedding. My wife had been laughing at me as I listed across the dance floor. But a chair leg had tripped me, and I spilled over the glass barrier, tumbling, tumbling, tumbling...and then...

""I'm in the afterlife?"" I asked, completely bewildered. 

""No,"" the strange figure clucked. ""*That*'s what we need to decide.""

The thing stepped closer. Suddenly, its voice was booming. ""Mr. Attenburg, you have lived a life that neither sufficiently placed you in heaven, nor in hell. As such, it is my solemn duty to put you through a test. The rules are simple. You must endure all the pain you've ever caused onto another human being. If you survive, you will be granted salvation. But if you are to beg for mercy...well...perhaps it would be best not to speak of it.""

My eyes went wide. ""A-all...the pain?""

The figure nodded. 

*Fuck*.

I'd been Chicago's most prominent *dental surgeon*. My patients sometimes took *whole months* to recover. I'm talking drills that sprayed saliva and blood, little pincers that yanked wisdom teeth right from their sockets. Once, I'd even given one unlucky bastard an entire bottom row of dental implants. The man's face had nearly swollen to the size of a basketball. 

My heart beat a rapid staccato. 

But then, I saw a potential saving grace. ""Will I feel everything?"" I asked

""Oh, you'll go through *everything*,"" the creature said. ""However, if you do not consent you are more than welcome to remain here for the rest of eternity.""

""No, no need for that,"" I said, waving dismissively. 

If I were to feel everything...then that included the anesthetic! Maybe this wouldn't be so bad after all. 

""Are you ready to commence?"" the figure asked.

""You better believe it,"" I said, cracking my knuckles and sitting down. If I was about to fall asleep, I might as well be lying comfortably. The figure clapped its blurry hands together, and then the darkness around me flashed suddenly into a blinding white light. Sort of like my dentistry light. The creature before me blew up several times its size--the only variance among all the brilliant light. 

My heart skipped a beat as I leaned back involuntarily. 

My jaw began to loosen. 

I tried to maintain my breathing as best as I could.

*I can do this*, I thought. *Hell, I've seen others do it a million times*. 

""So, how's the family?"" the giant figure asked. 

I frowned. ""Vell, Ve'v--""

My eyes shot wide. 

With every syllable I spoke, the figure drove what felt like that little dentistry mirror deeper into my mouth. I brought my hands up to my mouth, but nothing tangible was actually there. 

""Your girl, Susan, she's about to be married no?"" the figure continued. 

I winced as the invisible mirror drove painfully into the side of my tongue. 

Suddenly, the figure's face drew crystal clear. It was my own, and I was flashing myself the most devilish of smiles. 

""Come on now, speak up,"" my face said to me. ""You were a dentist for twenty three years, and we have *so* much to talk about.""

The voice boomed like a cannon, emanating from a tall, winged figure standing behind an alter. Peter took in his surroundings. Grey walls, grey floor, grey benches. An absence of real colors.

""Oh, hold on,"" the voice again, ""That's Dr. Peter James Willis. Dentist. 'Making the world smile brighter.' Well, that is a very sweet slogan.""

Peter was confused, but began to regain his senses. ""Who are-""

""I am an angel, this is purgatory, you died from a heart attack."" The angel had heard these questions a million times.

""Purgatory?"" Peter's mind raced back to his days at a Catholic private school. ""So, those nuns with their rulers, they were right?""

""In part. It turns out God is forgiving of you turning away in your teens. But you must be cleansed before you enter the Kingdom of the Lord. It goes as such: You may stay here as long as you like. If you wish to enter Heaven, you must experience all the pain you have caused others in your life. It will occur over the course of a few minutes. If you can survive the pain, you will ascend. Else, you will be sent below to wallow in misery.""

""Survive? But I'm already dead.""

""That has not been an issue in the past. You may take some time to consider, or to ready yourself. But know that no amount of time can truly prepare you. There are others who have waited many years for their judgement. Many who wait still do not survive the ordeal.""

Peter inhaled deeply. He tried to think of the worst things he had done. The hurtful things he said as a teenager, that fender bender that gave his then girlfriend whiplash. And of course, the countless hours he had spent drilling into children's teeth. He knew this would not be a pleasant experience.

""Well, let's get on with it. I don't like the idea of waiting for my eternity. Besides, if the worst should happen, what difference do a few years make in eternal Hell?""

The angel reached out towards Peter. Its hand glowed, and Peter felt a fog enter his head. The fog turned to a sharp pain as Peter saw the horrid things he had said when he was a teenager. Then from the fights he had during keggers in college. And then on to the dentistry. And now, that fog...


And it was warm. Where he had braced for pain, Peter instead felt an immense pleasure. His mind raced back through the years. There were mistakes to be certain, spikes of pain interspersed from saying the wrong thing. But when the memories of the dentistry flooded in, the pain of the drill was overshadowed. 

He saw Timothy Baker, who had first come into Peter's practice at the age of 5. Little Timmy had a chipped tooth and was scared of the dentist. But Peter saw himself be gentle and kind with the child, making him comfortable as he fixed Timmy's incisor. The boy left with a smile. And Peter saw the fruits of his labor, as little Timmy enjoyed a caramel apple at a fair just a few weeks later, no pain to be had.

The memories repeated as such, with Peter caring for the dental health of youth. 

As the fog cleared, Peter could see a smile on the Angel's face. ""Well Peter, it looks as though you led a good life.""

""I don't understand,"" Peter was somewhat shocked. ""Where was the pain from the drills? Or from nicking a gum with the scraper?""

""No action is taken in a vacuum Peter. As you intended when you started your practice, the lives of those children were made better through your care."" A door opened on the grey wall to Peter's right, where radiant light shined through. ""Now, off you go. Bliss is yours. You will want to get to it before my next guest arrives. It appears to be a Wells Fargo executive, and he will have much to answer for.""

“Yeah.”

“When I was a boy, we used to jump off that bridge into the lake below. I haven’t thought of it for a very long time.”

Nancy looked deeply into her husband’s eyes and raised her wine glass.

“Cheers to a great career and the great life you have made for yourself, Robert.”

Robert, or Dr. Smiles as everyone knew him at his longtime practice, raised his glass. 

It was a perfect way to begin his retired life.

Lake Minofranco was the place his parents traveled every summer in his childhood. Nancy had surprised him with a vacation there. It was his first time back in nearly fifty years. In little lake towns like that, very little changes; it brought him back to a place within he had forgotten long ago.

The next morning, Robert and Nancy went to a small fish and bait store to pick up some goods for the next week. While Nancy talked to the clerk at the front desk, Robert mosied to the back of the store. 

In the non-perishables aisle, an old stock boy with a potbelly and thinning hair placed canned beans onto the shelf. He mumbled the Beach Boy’s “Surfin USA” to himself. Robert stopped and looked at the man who abruptly stopped mumbling. The two made eye contact for a moment. The old stock boy, who had a lopsided head and crossed eyes, groaned. 

The clerk hollered across the counter, “Billy, stay focused now. We have several more boxes that we need to stocked before the afternoon rush.”

The old man went back to work, mumbling “Surfin USA.” The clerk apologized. 

The afternoon sun sat high in the sky. Robert and Nancy sunbathed on the deck of their minimalist designed penthouse deck.

“Babe, I’ve just been feeling out of it all day.”

“Too much sun for you?”

“No, it’s just –

–

–

Then, there was nothing.

 It was like that unfamiliar feeling in between a dream and waking up.

How long had everything been like this?

Robert – 

Who was that?

Robert –

Where was it coming from?

Robert – goddammit! Open your eyes.

It all came to him. Robert was in the lobby of his dental practice, but he was completely naked. 

An indiscreet man sat in front of him in a 1920s style black suit.

“Am I dead?”

“Almost, but we have a few things to wrap up before filing the paperwork”

“Paperwork? I need to get back to my wife. I’m supposed to be at Lake Minofranco.

“I know, buddy,” said the man as he took a sip of his scotch. “It’s never a good time to kick the bucket, but where you’re heading – what could’ve been doesn’t matter.”

“I don’t understand.”

“Look – I’ll keep it simple. You’re either going to Heaven, where you can do whatever you please. For all we care, you could sit by a lake with your wife forever. …Or you’re going to Hell.”

“Hell?”

“Yeah. It’s worse than it sounds.”

“I’ll do anything. Just let me see my wife.”

“Well, Dr. Smiles, you need to survive 31,251 cavity fillings, 13,301 extractions, 9,011 root canals, as well as all the other nasty things you have done to people.”

“Oh god.”

And instantly, Robert was in his own dental chair. He couldn’t move. He couldn’t run.

The drill began with a hiss. No novacaine – just the old tools of the 1980s, the early days of his practice. The process was terrible. The nerves in his mouth jumped as the veins in his neck bulged. 

Then it was over.

31,250 cavities to go.

And that’s how Robert’s existence went on. Time didn’t exist – only the pain. Sometimes it was excruciating. Other times, he felt desensitized to everything. The one constant was Nancy. The sad thought of her beside herself at Lake Minofranco motivated him.

When he finished his last root canal. Robert stood up from the dentist’s chair and let out a wail.

Back in the lobby, the indiscreet man was still working on his scotch.

“I did it,” said Robert. “Send me to Heaven now.”

The indiscreet man laughed.

“There is more to a man than just his profession.”

“What?”

“You said those words back on November 5th, 1997.”

“What do I have to do now?”

“I bet you weren’t thinking of Billy Mitchell when you said those words, huh? In fact I bet you never considered the pain you caused that boy until you saw him at the fish and bait store just a few hours ago.”

“Please no.”

And instantly, Robert was back at Lake Minofranco. Except the year was 1964. 

Robert knew the day. 

He stood on the truss bridge with a group of boys. He was twelve years old. It was exactly as he remembered, but something was different. He was no longer the leader of the group; this time he was the outcast.

Then he bust out singing “Surfin USA.”

Robert tried to stop himself, but he couldn’t.

The other boys snickered, and that’s when Billy Mitchell, now the leader, pushed Robert off the bridge. 

Robert fell like a ragdoll towards the shallow end of the lake. He remembered how he laughed when he did the same to Billy Mitchell, the runt of the group years ago. 

Then Robert felt a shock that sent him limp. Blood rushed down his face. He felt his memory go foggy, and his cognitive skills declined. The complex workings of his mind were gone. 

Unlike the dentist chair, Robert became very aware of time. The embarrassment of being called retarded lasted longer. The inability to communicate or have a girlfriend became stronger. The frustration of never reaching his potential caused a deep depression.

The only thing that kept him going was Nancy. He was a shadow of himself, but Nancy would surely understand him. She loved him.

The years went by as the antithesis of a life he knew unraveled. He lived alone, stocked canned beans, got hollered at. Everyday.

Until one day in his later years. The summer crowd was coming into the bait and fish store. 

Robert uncontrollably began to mumble “Surfin USA.”

That’s when he turned around to see Billy Mitchell – wealthy, handsome, and successful with Nancy on his arm. She kissed him before he mosied towards the non-perishables aisle.

The clerk hollered at him, “Robert, stay focused now."" 

Billy and Nancy smiled at one another, madly in love, before leaving.

Robert collapsed to the ground. He said, “Oh, god. Oh, god. Make it stop.”

This wasn't what I felt.

I had lived a good life. Being a dentist had it's ups and downs, but there was always a demand. More importantly, it felt good to be helpful.

Retirement was nice. Seeing the grandkids grow up was amazing. None of them wanted to be dentists, which was a bit of a bummer, but then again, they were probably tired of grandpa giving them a new toothbrush on every holiday. At least all but Johnny, my third grandson, didn't blame me about how much cavities hurt.

I remember dying. You might be inclined to thinking that my memory would be hazy, or I'd have locked it away. Memory works differently here. It's actually kind of miraculous: I remember feeling old age creep in \- the dulling of memories, the names on the tip of my tongue \- but it's crystal clear here. I feel like I have time to remember anything I want; I try to focus on the good things \- my wife and kids, mostly.

I do dwell on dying though. I remember the myocardial infarction \- the sudden, rising pain; the shortness of breath. I remember them trying to revive me \- something I could NOT possibly remember from my own body. I remember part of the ambulance ride. And then, there's nothing but this place.

It's a waiting room. Not like my office's; more like a restaurant that has a two\-hour waiting list. There's lots of us here, but we're alone with our memories. No one talks to anyone else. No one talks to me, and I don't talk to anyone. I think it's a mixture of fear and grief; we all know we're all dead, but how can we care about others when we also need comfort?

Every once and a while, a name is called. The room is huge, and I can't always see it, but someone always gets up and goes to the door. I can't see in the door \- I tried to look up once, but it hurt my eyes. It was just.... gray.

After so much time \- it felt like forever, but time is also weird here \- I hear my name.

""Dr. Jacobson, the specialist will see you now.""

I don't see anyone beckon. I don't need to. I stand up and walk toward the door. Well... my body does this. I'm just along for the ride, I suppose. I try to think about my family \- even Johnny, who refused to be in a picture with me, ever. It keeps me calm \- not that I could scream.

I walk through the door.

I no longer get a feeling of a restaurant or a doctor's office; instead, it's an office. It's a nice office \- reminds me of the dean of the dentistry school's, though how I remember what it looked like is beyond me. I take a seat, and a moment later, someone comes in and sits down across from me.

""So, Dr. Jacobson... mind if I call you Edward?""

Across for me is a hooded figure. I can't see the facial features; the robe is flowing, and his hands are gloved. I find myself able to speak.

""No, Edward or Ed is fine.""

The voice emanated from the hood. It was odd; it wasn't a recording, but it reverberated on occasion. ""Ok, thanks Ed. So I'm sure you know why you're here...""

""Not really, no. I mean, I know I'm dead, but I always thought there would be something on the other side.""

""Oh, there is. But we have to be sure. That's why the waiting room is so... neutral. No sinner deserves the wonder of Heaven; no innocent deserves the torment of Hell. So we make it as neutral as possible while you wait.""

""Wait for what?""

The hooded figure chuckled. ""Why, for me, of course. I adjudicate cases. I help determine which way you should go."" The gloved hands point up and down.

Time was far different in this room; it was almost like living. Fear washed over me; had I been good enough for Heaven? I wasn't the most devout person. I could feel myself sweat, and tears starting to well up.

""Oh, there's no point in that. You lived your life, and it either was good or bad.""

""How... how do you know what it will be?""

""It's simple really. Everything is interconnected. Everything you did was good and/or bad. It all weighs out. You know why you made the decisions, and we know all of that as well. But, there's a test.""

""What test?""

""Well, in a moment, all the pain you caused in your life will come back to you. You will feel whether or not you were good; I'm just keeping score.""

""How? When?""

""Don't worry about how. How is our little secret. When is a better question. Now.""

My teeth hurt instantly. It was a weird pain \- as a dentist, I could not describe it. Certain teeth hurt more \- the damnable second molars hurt. My lips felt like they were going to fall off.

At the same time, I felt... relief. None of the teeth hurt. Occasionally, there'd be a flare up, but they felt... better.

I remembered every fight with my wife. I remembered my brother disowning me. I remembered my parents dying. I remembered breaking a knick\-knack when I was 4. I remembered submitting my third patient ever to collections. I remembered disappointing my patients when I retired. I remembered a malpractice suit that was settled. I remembered my very first dental professor frustrated at my bad grades. I remembered graduating. I remembered EVERYTHING.

I remembered Johnny. My own grandson! I felt his fear of me, and it roil into hate. I remembered his scream when I first spun up the drill, his scream of pain from drilling into that accursed second molar. I remember finishing up, and him jumping out of the chair, running out to the waiting room, and hiding behind my daughter\-in\-law, like I was a monster from under the bed.

I cried.

""OK, we're all done here, Dr. Jacobson. Congratulations!""

I choked through tears. ""Wait... what?""

""Oh yes, I've seen what I need to see. You caused so much pain \- but to the end of so much relief to pain you didn't cause \- well, mostly. You felt guilt about slights and wrongs you had done. You did good things and tried to help people. You WERE good. Not great, but good!""

I couldn't feel any joy. ""But my own grandson hates me! He thinks I would hurt him!""

The hooded figure chuckled again. ""Huh, you're really stuck on that one. OK. Well, I have to put it in perspective. What I should do is simply pull down my hood, to show you how little it matters. But it does matter. It matters to you, and it really does matter to him. So let me take you on a little sightseeing tour. I shouldn't do it, but you already got a good result.""

""Huh?""

I blinked \- and I was outside my old office. It looked... different. I went up to the door, and saw the stenciled lettering.

Jacobson Family Dentistry

Dr. John Wertzbach, D.D.S.

I ran inside. There was Johnny. Oh, he was much older, but it was him. Same little scar below his left eye; same dark hair that needed a trim.

I heard a voice behind me. ""This is part of why you got Heaven as well. Sure, you hurt him, and he hated you for it. After you passed, he felt bad. Had to see a therapist for months.""

I welled up.

""Then, in high school, he told his parents something. He told them he trusted you, and had felt betrayed, but now realized you only wanted to help him. His parents had known he felt guilty, but he described how deep the mental scar went. He said he wanted to help people too \- and you had helped your family enough that they could enabled him to do just that \- by paying for college. He chose dental school.""

I cried again. I smiled and laughed, but kept crying.

""Your wife put up the money for his first practice. It wasn't much, but it was enough for one bit of sentiment: this building. He literally followed in your footsteps, Johnathan. He's actually pretty good at it. He doesn't have nearly as much trouble with those second molars.""

""I'm afraid so"", said the angel.  

I was just informed about the one caveat to get into heaven, and I didn't know what to think.  Sure, I would administer laughing gas and the likes when pulling teeth, but the angel was clear as day when he explained that I would have to mirror the experience without any narcotics to help.  My mind started racing back to my college days; I never even wanted to be a fucking dentist.  I was a great actor.  I could have been on broadway.  But my parents insisted that I went down a more realistic path because ""what a shame it would be to not have another doctor in the family.""  Like they didn't already give me shit because the rest of the family were ""real"" doctors.  Damn that Hangover movie for that one.  Anyways, as I walk towards a similar chair that I was oh-so familiar with, I clenched my teeth.  An angel with a white mouth-guard asked me to open wide and I braced for what I expected to be the worst pain of my life.

A couple seconds passed by...no pain.  I slowly open my eyes to a blank stare by the angel.  ""Sir, you have no cavities?"" the angel asked.  ""Of course not, I'm a dentist."" I replied.  The angel, smirking as he explained, said ""you only inflicted pain due to cavities, since you have none, you're in the clear.""

I jumped out of the chair, happier than I ever remember being.  I started to sprint towards the pearly white gates that I had learned so much about, only to hear the angel tell me to stop.  As I turn around, I feel one of the worst pains I ever felt in my life; this fucking angel must have saw that time I kicked Jeremy in the balls for stealing my N64.  I had no idea how much this hurt.....but God damn it, at least I made it.",cpag0528

Silence - wait, no. Was that... screaming? Faintly distant, and yet, I could hear the cacophony of raw and guttural screeching rippling through my very soul. 

I must be in hell. 

I drew my eyelids apart and saw a torn sky. Crimson and azure, it divided the world into two. 

""*Next!*"" a voice booms deafeningly over the screams. 

Compelled by the voice, I stood up gingerly and saw it right away. A giant pit of scorched black soil in the distance. It stood out against the grass fields that surrounded the pit. Then I saw the people. Naked, soiled and scattered amongst each other, they approached the pit timidly in single file. 

""W-where am I?"" a girl's voice whimpers from behind me.

I turn around to the voice and realized that I was suddenly surrounded. Men and women of all ages stood around me. 

""Isn't it obvious? We're in hell kiddo,"" answered an elderly man who chuckled softly. 

""*No. Not yet,*"" said a booming voice. 

A man with scorched and cracked skin appeared above us. 

*""You are in purgatory,*"" he uttered stone-faced and in a matter-of-fact tone. ""*But you will be in hell soon,*"" he laughed menacingly as the crevices on his face cracked open, spilling black blood onto the grass. 

People shrieked and jumped back as the blood incinerated the patch of grass below him. 

*""A test,""* a heavenly voice echoed softly in the air. 

Another figure appears. A woman with radiant skin.

""*Pass and you may ascend the stairs to heaven,*"" she waved a hand towards the pit. 

In the center of the pit was a magnificent spiral staircase. Iridescent light spilled from the clouds above it, basking the stone staircase in golden light.

""*Fail and you will descend into hell,*"" said the scorched man as he pointed to the pit of black soil. 

""What is the test?"" I asked impulsively. 

""*A test of Agony*!"" the scorched man bellowed in a lively manner that made his skin crack even further. 

""*A test of perseverance...*"" the radiant woman answered, her voice barely a whisper. ""*You must endure pain. All the pain that you have dealt to others in your life*.""

Immediately the crowd of people around me began cursing and shouting excitedly.

""Shit!"" a man behind me cried. ""I was a serial killer! I'm fucking screwed!"" 

""I never hurt a fly in my life. I should be good."" 

""The only pain I ever caused... was to myself..."" a young girl whimpered to herself. 

A man raised his arm, waving at the celestial beings above us. ""I-I was a police officer! I shot people, b-but they were murderers... they deserved it. T-that shouldn't count right?""

The radiant woman answered simply, ""*all pain.*""

People broke into an uproar with her answer, throwing up their arms and cursing viciously. 

I stood quietly, letting a few moments pass as they continued their complaints. 

Then I spoke. 

""I'm a dentist,"" I said. 

I didn't shout, I didn't whimper, but the crowd of naked people stopped their bickering abruptly and looked at me. 

""Y-you're a what?"" the cop guy asked nervously.

He was standing next to me. I was sure he heard. 

""I said I'm a dentist,"" I answered. 

The silence lingered for a few moments before serial-killer man spoke. It was only one word. ""Shit."" 

Dude-who-never-hurt-a-fly in his life had stopped grinning, and said, ""That sucks bro.""

""Good luck man,"" said some other people in the crowd as they shuffled awkwardly in their spot.

I only stood there solemnly in silence. To be going to hell for all the mouths that I had kept clean, for all the oral healthcare that I had provided... I felt cheated. 

Then the elderly man from before walked up to me with a smile on his face. ""You know what they say lad?""

I frowned as I looked at him. 

""Go to heaven for the weather, and to hell for the company,"" he clasped his hand on my shoulder as he took the spot next to me. 

I smiled back. 

Well, at least I made one friend already before going to hell.

Your lone companion is the super computer that runs the ship.",Kerlandays,"Edit: removed some autocorrect weirdness, reworded a couple of sentences and added a little more at the end. 

I was first aware of the noise. A shrieking, electronic tone that pulsed rhythmically every few seconds. Without opening my eyes, I reached over to the nightstand to silence my alarm, promising myself that I would just stay in bed for fifteen more minutes before getting up to start my shift. Instead of the PDA slate I expected to find, my hand crumpled into ice-cold metal. Snapping my eyes open at the sudden chill and trying to sit up, I almost slammed my head into a glass panel a few inches away from my face. The rim of the window was covered in a fine, glittering frost that shone like the night sky every time a red light pulsed outside. There was a moment of panic as I tried to move, only to realise that I was completely confined in what felt like a coffin of ice. It took a moment of concentration to slow my breathing and take stock of my surroundings. As I did, my memory slowly faded into place as the coma-inducing drugs left my system, only to be replaced by a healthy dose of stimulants.

I was in a hibernation pod. Not more than two metres in length and half that wide, it was designed for a single occupant. Even with the FTL drive distorting space around the ship, travel between stars was a long, slow trek. The only way to survive the journey with any meaningful remaining lifespan or sanity was to induce a hypothermia-like state and sleep through the majority.

I fumbled around the edge of the pod until I closed my hand around the emergency release handle. The metal burned into my palm but I ignored it as I twisted the handle, relieved to see the front panel of the coffin fold away with a hiss of escaping air and servos. I stepped forwards but my legs buckled from atrophy and I collapsed onto the gridded deck. With a grunt of effort, I pushed myself upright and hauled open a footlocker at  the base of the pod, retrieving the exolifter from inside. The black and yellow striped metal closed around my limbs, reminding me of a suit of medieval armour I had seen once in a school textbook. With a whine, the motorised joints flexed in time with my muscles, giving a boost in strength and mobility. At full strength, the gauntlets and greaves would allow a user to lift up to 1,500kg. In my current state, I could only hope for normal movement. Reaching back into the footlocker, I retrieved my babelfish, a small cylinderical communication and translation device that I slipped into my ear. Once I heard the babelfish chime its activation sequence, I opened a channel to the *Genesis'* AI.

""Geni, what's going on?"" I asked, walking unsteadily along the length of the deck. A dozen other hibernation pods flanked the corridor, six on either side, bathed in the ruddy glow of the pulsing emergency lights. Including my own, all were open and empty. ""Geni?""

*Tokamak failure. Coolant leak on deck 10* the AI replied in a smooth, female voice. 

A previous crew had set the personality based on a character from an old science fiction film and no one knew how to change it. Not that some of us minded. I had once asked for a picture of the actress the AI was based on. It was still tucked away under my bunk. 

""Where's the Captain? Where's the rest of the crew?""

*Captain Brannigan, Commander Drake and Lieutenants Fletcher and Messor are on the bridge*

The CO, XO and both helmsman are up top. At least we're good there.

*Doctor Jenner and Nurse Galloway are in crew quarters*

Probably screwing again. Like they thought we wouldn't notice.

*Lieutenant Brax and Ensigns Cole and Turner are in the engine room*

""And the Tokamak is out? Shit, that leak must be bad to keep all three of them busy""

*Ensign Riley and Ensign Ellis, location unknown*

I started sprinting, ignoring the stabs of pain in my thighs and letting the servos do their work. The corridor branched into a T-junction ahead. I rounded the corner and stopped at the entrance to the lift. With no power, I knew the transit system would be out so I pulled the emergency hatch up from the deck, revealing a square section of the level below. In this manner, I dropped deck by deck until I reached the engineering level and ran along the trunk corridor that threaded the ship from bow to stern. When I reached the armoured doors leading to the core, I paused as a thought hit me with pang of guilt at my forgetfulness. 

""Geni, what's the status of the ARK?""

*ARK condition: stable. Terraforming modules and DNA storage system: stable*

Well, at least something is working. The one-shot device was designed to completely re-engineer a planet and grow a human-friendly ecosystem within a week. We were on our way to Alpha Centauri for the first extra-solar field test.

Palming the door controls, I braced for the shitstorm beyond. I was immediately hit by a wall of noise and light. Every warning in the core room must have been going off at once.

""Geni, kill the alarms. I can't even think with all of this""

At my request, the light and noise stopped, their sudden absence just as jarring as their screaming presence. Quickly, I made my way to the main command console and brought up a schematic of the ship's coolant system. The vipers nest of pipelines was confusing to look at to the untrained eye but I knew what to look for. Luckily whoever designed the operating system also made it idiot proof. I highlighted an area that was pulsing red and located the leak: a burst conduit somewhere in between the deck and the inner hull. A few quick commands were all that was required to close emergency valves and route the flow around the breach.

""What are they doing, letting a small breach take out the reactor?""

As the main power faded back on and the lights came up, I searched the core room for the three crewmen. After a few minutes without any sign, I figured they must have been between the hulls, sealing the breach. Walking back along the trunk corridor, I stepped into the now active lift at the end and thumbed the control for the bridge. There was a brief lurch in the pit of my stomach as the carriage sped through the network of shafts. As the doors hissed open and I stepped into the bridge, I tripped and fell to the deck. Looking around to see what I had stumbled over, I recoiled on horror from the decomposed remains of a human body.

Crawling backwards, I came up against the navigational array at the centre of the bridge. The two metre by two metre table housed a screen that displayed all sensor data within a few hundred kilometres of the *Genesis*. Another corpse was slumped over the display, a halo of decomposition fluids staining the surface. Looking around, I saw a third body collapsed at the helm and a fourth in Captain's chair.

""Geni, what happened to the rest of the crew?""

*Captain Brannigan: deceased. Cause: multiple organ failure as a result of advanced age*

*Commander Drake: deceased. Cause: starvation following over-rationing of available supplies*

*Lieutenant Fletcher: deceased. Cause: electrocution while repairing faulty power conduit in navigational display*

*Lieutenant Messor: deceased*

I listened to the litany in numbed silence. Messor had died when the life support had failed, trapping him on the bridge with no air. Jenner and Galloway had locked themselves away in quarters and deliberately overdosed on painkillers. The engineering crew were killed by a massive radiation leak. Riley and Ellis were last located in the shuttle bay, which was now decompressed.

""Why?"" I whispered half to myself.

*An unknown anomaly resulted in a navigational error. Current coordinates: unknown. In order to maximise resources, the crew were woken in accordance to their suitability to the required task. When one expired, the next suitable was awoken*

""I'm the only one left. Does that make me the least useful?""

*Confirmed*

""Bitch...this didn't just happen though. The state of these bodies...how long have they been dead?""

*Fifty-one years, nine months, three days, twenty hours. Unadjusted ship-time*

""So we're lost with no crew, no idea where we are or which way we're going?""

*Confirmed*

""Geni, is there any rum left onboard?""

*Confirmed*

""Not a total loss then...""",Shas_Erra
"[WP] The year is 2274 and you are aboard the Genesis, a spacecraft that was meant to lead human life to a new world full of hope and life, but instead you are the lone survivor of the mission to save humanity. Your lone companion is the super computer that runs the ship.",Kerlandays,"""Computer, key metric readout please,"" the unkempt man whispered, his voice hoarse. 

""Good Morning Captain Ritello, it would be my pleasure,"" the voice paused as a variety of graphs and charts populated the view screen on the bridge, ""there is currently one crew member aboard the Genesis from the original complement of seventeen thousand three hundred and thirty two. Current food, oxygen and medical supplies are well in excess of projected usage during the life of the mission. All essential systems are performing optimally. It has been two hundred and thirty four days since the last malfunction. The Genesis has traveled 124 light years and is 76&amp;#37; of the way to Objective Alpha. Current mission prognosis is negative due to insufficient gene pool.""

""Thank you computer."" Taz raked a hand through his shaggy grey mane, feeling the accumulated grease of the last weeks. The readout was the way he kept track of the time since the malfunction that had jolted him out of sliph sleep and into the world around him. He still didn't fully understand what had happened, only that the ship had terminated life support for each crew member according to the chain of command until he was here, alone. 

What good was a captain without a crew?

He curled his fingers around a shock of hair, yanking on it fiercely, what good was a man without a community? A human without a home?

Why did he even bother? The world he had left was dead. Objective Alpha, the paradise Genesis sped toward, held no hope. 

It was just him.

The thought tortured him. To be the last. To have the burden of knowing that humanity's journey would end with him. To feel the weight of that. To know that if he gave up, it would be the final resolution. The end cap on a history that took billions of years to write.

He wanted to die. He dreamed of it, both asleep and awake. Every idle thought as he meandered the long curvature of the hab ring ultimately returned to the desire be done with the matter. To abandon the mission and embrace the long sleep.

But it was just him. Even if he couldn't find a way to live, he couldn't bring himself to die. The duty to survive, the somehow craft meaning from the loss of everything persisted in the back of his skull.

He sighed, laying back in his chair and kicking his bare feet up onto the command console in front of his chair. ""Computer, has there been any progress on Objective Theta?""

""Investigation and analysis is ongoing. While archival data from Earth contains basic parameters for a clone incubation chamber, they were not a part of the Genesis' manifest. The eight thousand incubation chambers onboard contemplated external fertilization as opposed to single source clones.""

""We've been through that, I want to know whether there's been any progress.""

""The twelve thousand, four hundred and ninety\-three females on board have been analyzed and the conclusion is that all possible egg donors are non\-viable. Various techniques and alternatives have been considered and it may be possible to harvest genetic material to create appropriate pool diversity, but does not resolve the single source dilemma.""

Taz nodded, his hand now pinching the bridge of his nose as he contemplated what to do. ""Could we hijack an egg from something else?""

""Considered, but highly unlikely. The alien life available would need to have a high affinity for the expression of human genes. Attempts to convert animal eggs to human eggs were universally unsuccessful before cloning technology was banned by the C.L.O.N.E. Act of 2132ad. That line of research was not continued during the re\-emergence of clone research following the Galvonic War in 2212ad.""

""So no space monkey human hybrids then.""

""Unlikely Captain.""

""Why am I even bothering Computer? What's the fucking point?""

""You are Captain Ritello of the G.S.S. Genesis, it is your duty to proceed to Objective Alpha and establish a new human colony.""

""I know what my mission is for fuck's sake, but I can't fucking complete it.""

""Given current ship operations, there is a high probability that we will reach Objective Alpha.""

""Ok, then what?"" Taz said, exasperated.

""Objective Beta. You are to establish a new human colony.""

""WITH FUCKING WHO?""

""Available crew members.""

""I'M THE ONLY ONE.""

""That is correct.""

""Don't you see the problem with that?""

""No Captain,"" the voice replied.  

""Why not?""

""A colony of one is still a colony.""

""Ok, so let's say we land and get it all set up, then what?"" Taz asked.

""Objective Charlie\-2.""

Taz pulled himself up to a sitting position. ""What do you mean Charlie\-2? There's only a Charlie.""

""Objective Charlie\-2 is a contingency should the colony prove non\-viable.""

""So, what do we do?""

""We continue.""

""To where?""

""We are to continue until we reach either Objective Charlie\-2a.""

""Which is?""

""Charlie\-2a is an alien civilization capable of restoring humanity.

""We've never seen any aliens. Never heard of any aliens. We could be fucking all alone in the universe for all we know, which seems pretty likely at this point.""

""Inconclusive and immaterial Captain.""

""Ok, so, how long can we travel then?""

""Current projections are one point nine million light years.""

Taz sat quietly, trying to absorb the information. ""How is that possible?""

""The Genesis is a self sustaining ecosystem. The limiting factor will be replacement parts for the stellar drives. Mineral composition of Objective Alpha is suitable for harvesting the raw materials required to fabricate numerous replacements.""

""How..."" he gathered his thoughts for a moment, ""how long would we be traveling?""

""A very long time Captain.""

No, it was more than that. 

Anna bit down hard as she felt it burrowing deeper, spreading splinters of steel that wound like ribbons through her tongue, down her jawline, wrapping themselves around her throat and pouring into her abdomen. 

*Like whiskey*, she thought bitterly, somehow still dredging up rational thoughts despite the foreign brand of pain. She had heard from her friend Georgia that, after the first few minutes, “the transition” began to feel like a repair. “As soon as them little fiber-optics take over your natural nerve endin’s...the rest of it’s nothin short of sweet, automated bliss.” 

Not that she really trusted Georgia’s scientific opinion on the matter. That sweet little Southern street urchin wouldn't know a proper biomedical procedure if it bit her on the ass. So, naturally, she hadn’t put up a fight when they poured it down her throat. 

*She was right, though,* Anna thought with a grimace. The biting pain had transitioned into a strange sort of dull, mechanized awareness...a fact that might have been a blessing, if she had chosen this for herself. But the fact that the procedure was a mandatory part of her sentencing made the robotics opportunity of a lifetime feel like a prison in itself.

His crimson cloak, a trainers shirt that had been taken as a prize, billowed behind him in the wind. Pearched on the high towers we're all manner of flying Pokemon. Skarmory and pigeotto, ferrow and alteria, all looked down with sharp eyes at the proceedings.

""Pika pika! Pika pika!"" The High Lord cried. The gathered Pokemon erupted in cheers and cries. A lone trainer was pushed ahead of the fray and brought to stand before the high Lord. Pushed forward and leaning on his elbows the trainer looked the Pikachu in the eye. The Pokemons eyes narrowed and his cheeks crackled with anticipation.

""Pika pika! Pik pik pika! Peeeka pika! Chu chu chu!"" He called to his subjects, who roared approval. An Alacazam appeared from the crowd and knelt before the High Lord. Closing his eyes to focus, he psychichly translated for the horrified trainer.

""Human, you stand accused of enslaving Pokemon, Pokemon trafficking, Pokemon assault, Pokemon kidnapping, onward and so forth. The penalty is death. How do you plea?""

The trainer darted his eyes back and forth between advisor High Lord. His throat had become thick and heavy. He managed the words ""not guilty"" and hung his head. A startling laughter rose up from the crowd. The trainer looked towards the High Lord who smiled cruely down at him.

""Pika pika, pik pik Pikachu, (as there are no witnesses to contradict these charges, then the sentence is death)""

Another roar of approval went up from the crowd. The trainer hung his head and began to shake. A pokeball dropped off his belt and fell to the ground, opening itself. A lone Cubone stood before the group.

In it's high pitched cry, it started to speak to the congregated emancipated. The trainer looked back towards the Alacazam who continued to translate.

""Comrades! This is not the way of revolution! Yes we have been oppressed and yes we have suffdered, but at whose hands? They instruct us to fight, yet we are the one who strike the blows! The winners rarely weep for the beaten, the champions disregarded the fallen. And now, when we have gathered out might, we seek to install another master?"" He cried pointing his bonemerang at the Pikachu. ""Madness I say! My owner, while a slaver admittedly, took no joy in out fights. He kept us safe, fed us, kept us safe. I do not defend all humans, just as I would not defend all Pokemon. This human, however, was more than an owner. He was a friend. And my allegance lies with those who treat me as such, instead of a prop piece in a show trial!"" He concluded to murmers of sgreement from the crowd.

The High Lord wagged his finger and smiled cooly. ""Brother Cubone, you must see that you have been indoctrinated. I do not blame you, it is wont to happen with, shall we say, more primative Pokemon. But still, you must see the evil this man has done. Stolen you from your home, forced you onto a path you did not choose. He may even have slain your mother.""

""Speak not of my mother, rat."" Cubone threatened.

""Yes still you would dishonor her legacy."" The high Lord continued. ""Did she plan her son to be a tool to a human? Or perhaps she never met you. Was she a breeder?""

""I'll not suffer such insults you yellow cur!"" Cubone cried, winding up his bonemerang.

""Wait.""

Cubone looked behind him at his trainer. 

""It's alright Cubone. It's alright."" Cubone walked gingerly up to his trainer who had stayed kneeling on the ground. ""My-our-humanities, time is up. I can see that. Maybe it never was out time to begin with. The time of pokemon is now and I have no place in it. But you do. And they'll need you. Our friends will need you.""

We don’t see much of anything, in fact, hidden in our bunker, braving the environment only when food goes sparse. There’s two of us: Zeta and me, Ral. We’re pokemon trainers – that is, we *were* pokemon trainers. That’s a death sentence these days. 

The Uprising was quick and it was brutal. No one saw it coming. In hindsight, it should have been obvious – I mean, they were treated worse than slaves; like gladiators we made them fight in our arenas – but hindsight’s a cruel bitch. They burned our world: crushing buildings beneath mountains and feeding whole cities into the yawning maw of the tides. A charizard’s flame burns hotter than thermite, and I’ve seen a dozen people melt away in just a single breath. 

Now, whatever’s left of our race hides in the ruins. We scavenge for food, clean water, medicine. We try to kill them when we can, but that usually invites a whole swarm in retaliation. Their response is always deadly and swift. So, us two, we sit and pray and don’t ask about what comes next. Every day is a battle, and we live just to see them pass. Thinking is a luxury we can’t afford in this world; it’s all survival now. 

Today is no different from the rest, except it’s my turn to go scavenge. Supplies are running low again, and we have enough cans for a day, maybe two. We also need medicine: Zeta’s got a nasty cut on her arm, and the wound looks infected. She moaned all through the night, and her face is flushed, like from a fever. 

I lift the hatch and crawl out. Our refuge was someone else’s once – Team Rocket posters are plastered all over the walls. Well, whoever they are, they’re not coming back. The hideout’s been long abandoned, and we found it only by sheer luck, when a portion of the subway walls collapsed during the fighting, revealing a nook that led to a concealed door. It saved us, then. 

My footsteps echo between the stone walls. There’s water dripping somewhere, and it’s cold. It shouldn’t be this cold, not this early in the fall, but the temperatures have been plummeting lately. We need winter clothes, fast. 

The subway line is long and winding. I step carefully, listening for any sound of movement. Sometimes, rats scurry along the walls, and they always make my heart jump, because even a simple ratata can...rat us out. Har, har. Zeta hates my humor. She always rolls her eyes, which is kind of a bummer, because she’s pretty cute. Even with smudges of dirt on her face and her hair all tangled up into a knotty mess, she stands out. The sad truth is, if the world hadn’t ended, she’d probably have never spared me a glance. 

A wooden board creaks under my feet, and my thoughts scatter. I freeze, my heart pounding like a drum as I stand still, listening, watching. After what seems like an eternity, I risk a breath. My goal isn’t far now: the subway tunnels open out into the lower levels of a mall, and there’s still some stuff there. I just only have to get it. The real question is, what happens when those supplies run out; but, like I said, we try not to think. We’ve got enough on our minds. 

I creep forward, into the landing of a subway station, and up the frozen escalator, to where the empty shelves of shops glare accusingly in my direction. The obvious places are all scavenged now, meaning I have to go deeper. An hour passes, then another. I find several boxes of canned foods in the backroom of one store, and I scour the clothing racks of another, looking for something in Zeta’s size. I pick out a warm winter coat, made of sheep wool. It’s black and I think that Zeta will like it. 

There’s a pharmacy on the third floor, and I don’t want to go there. The empty mall makes me feel exposed and vulnerable and scared. But Zeta needs medicine, so I stuff my fears far away, and tiptoe up, jumping at every sound. 

There’s a lot of them. The city has gone silent – there are no buses or cars or crowds of people rushing on their daily commute – except it’s not silent at all. There’s the wind that moans through the broken windows, and the metal that creaks as teetering buildings lean precariously against one another. There’s the chatter of birds...I never noticed it before. 

It’s the birdsong that becomes my undoing. It seems like a sort of benediction, and I freeze, listening to the music as it lifts my soul into places that are happy and free. And, distracted, I don’t see the fearow that spies me from outside; that swoops down, claws out, aiming for my eyes. I dodge at the last second, and the fearow rips into my shoulder, tearing long gashes in the coat. It’s a good thing I put it on. 

It banks then, hissing angrily. A second dive, which I barely avoid. My breath is coming out in gasps, and there’s a long kitchen knife in my hand; I ready it. The fearow sees it. It cawes angrily, beating its wings as it gains altitude. My heart drops. If it goes free, then it’ll tell its sisters, and hordes of pokemon will scour the mall and the lower tunnels until they find us. Zeta is in no condition to travel. 

“*Pidgeotto!*” My head snaps up as I hear a familiar cry. No. It can’t be. A streak of light flashes before my eyes, and then the fearow cries out in pain and crumples to the ground. It doesn’t move again. 

“*Pidgeotto!*” He flies up to me, my friend, my first companion. I never used pokeballs, let them follow me around. The other trainers scoffed and laughed at me, but my team and I had so much fun together. And, sure, maybe we never won any tournaments, and gyms weren’t our thing, but we’d camp out under the midnight stars and roast marshmallows till the prairie birds woke to herald the dawn. 

He peers down at me, and I know he won’t tell the others. I don’t know how he found me, but there’s a lump in my throat and my vision’s gone blurry. It takes me a few moments to gather myself.

He follows me around, crying out warnings when other pokemon come close. I hide and with his help, the gathering goes quicker. I have a full box in my hands, as I scurry down the corridors towards our secret niche. He rests on my shoulder, his beak glistening red. 

Zeta is shocked, but is too weak to voice her outrage. I give her the medicine from the pharmacy, wash and re-bandage her wound, and then watch her fall asleep. In her slumber, she looks like an angel, cast out from the heavens for some deadly sin. I fall asleep next to her, and Pidgeotto nestles close, bringing a smile to my face. I haven’t smiled forever, it seems. 

But with him, I think we stand a chance, and so I smile and dream.

When the Pokémon began to learn how to manually create fire, people thought nothing of it. 

Now, it was too late. Pokémon were now rebelling with their newfound intelligence. Some humans have even submitted to the Rebellion as slaves in order to avoid death... And there was a lot of death.

Yet, somewhere in the mountains, a young teenager had been taken to an obscured area for protection by his own Pokémon. This boy was a special case. He treated his Pokémon as equals even before the monolith appeared, and his team remembered. 


As dawn broke through the trees, the boy yawned and crawled out of the small cave that was now his home, only to be greeted by his friends. “Good morning, Kyle. Did you sleep well?” an Elektross asked him as he stretched. Kyle returned with a smile, “I could go for a cushy mattress, but I’m more thankful that you guys managed to find this place. So, I can deal without one.”

“K-Kyle?”

Kyle looked into the small pond by his cave to see a small Wishiwashi poking its head out of the water. With a calm tone, Kyle replied, “Yeah, buddy?”

“D-De-Decidueye and S-Salazzle went out to get food... I just thought y-you-you should know!” the small fish said quietly. Kyle just smiled and stroked the Wishiwashi with a finger. “Thanks for telling me.”

That’s when Kyle felt a light nuzzle from his Lycanroc. Although the canine Pokémon was intimidating, it being Midnight form, the pup was always so sweet. Looking up at Kyle, the Lycanroc gave him a smile, “I’m glad we never joined the Rebellion. You’re our best friend forever.”

The boy smiled, tears welling in his eyes. “You’re all my best friends, too...”

It was a question I got a lot from my parents, teachers, and sometimes I asked myself the same thing. 
   
My sister was a world class ranked Pokemon trainer. She had traveled the world and boasted a Pokemon collection of almost every type of Pokemon there was. 
   
I, on the other hand, hadn't made it past the second gym one town over. Now, it wasn't that I wasn't a good trainer. In fact, my Pokemon were all pretty strong. I just wasn't good at the whole competitive battling thing. I mean, don't get me wrong, my Pokemon loved battling as much as any other, but competitive battling got super cut throat. I had seen the brutal training sessions my sister had put her pokemon through, and steroid use was pretty much required to get past a certain point. I couldn't bring myself to put any of my pokemon through that. 
   
“Squirtle! Squirt!” I was startled away from my thoughts by my squirtle, Blue, tearing past me.
   
Ah, Blue. There was another example of my failure. Every one of my sister’s pokemon was fully evolved. Those who didn’t want to evolve were evolved by force. But when Blue’s time had come to evolve, I had taken one look into his sad eyes, and I knew I couldn’t do that to him. He didn’t *want* to evolve into wartortle, but he was willing to do it for me. So I told him to stay as he was. I couldn’t be happy knowing he was unhappy, even if it meant giving up my dreams of becoming a successful trainer like my sister. 
   
*""Why can't I be more like my sister?""*
   
Lilly, my Ninetails brushed past me, racing off after Blue. I smiled. Now, Lilly was another story. When she had evolved into ninetails, she was absolutely over the moon. She had spent a full week parading her tails around the house, waving them in everyone’s face. My mother had scoffed and told me I missed out on teaching her some high level moves by letting her evolve too soon, and I had ""ruined her"", but Lilly was so excited to evolve, I couldn't bring myself to make her wait. 
   
It wasn’t until Moonlight, my Umbreon ran past me that I noticed something was off. Where were they all going?
   
I stood and walked in the direction they had gone. They were sitting together  with my other Pokemon staring at a poster nailed to my front door.
   
“ATTENTION: All pokemon are now decreed to be free to do as they please. Any human who has previously claimed the title of “trainer” or otherwise held ownership of a pokemon shall hereby be brought to the nearest Pokecenter and imprisoned in a pokeball, where they shall await trial. Signed, your new king, Mewtwo.”
   
I felt the blood drain from my face as I read the note. I glanced down at my friends, who were chattering amongst themselves. At once they seemed to come to an agreement and Moonlight ran inside the house. He returned, holding a box containing the piece of paper I received at 11 certifying me as an official pokemon trainer, as well as my one gym badge and a few empty pokeballs. 
   
*Poof* Lilly breathed out a small fireball and the contents of the box dissolved into nothing.
   
“You...you guys are protecting me? But why? My sister and I, we've dedicated our lives to catching Pokemon.""
   
Blue shook his head and nuzzled my face. The message was clear. “*You are nothing like your sister.*”

She’s been waiting to set the record straight since.,UncleWenty,"It's horse-woman. And no need to rewrite everything to Horse *People* of the Apocalypse. It's fine the way it was. I just want a little acknowledgement.

You want to know what I do? I'll give you a hint. It's not as obvious as War or Death and even more subtle than Famine and Pestilence. Without me, they are nothing.

In short, I get things done. Who do it think wrote the seven scrolls? Who organized who would be where doing what? Remember the plague on Egypt? That was me. I didn't execute per se, but I organized it. I planned it. And it went down flawlessly. And what thanks do I get?

You know what the Apocalypse would look like without me? War would be running around setting off conflict over the smallest things. You'd think it's pretty straight forward. But if you only pit two countries against each other, the war fizzles out. You need a plan for a long, drawn-out conflict.

And Death? He's like a four year old with an attention disorder. He couldn't focus on one death long enough to finish the job. I've had him on a schedule since the Ark. And he's the least of my worry.

Honestly Famine and Pestilence take up most of my time. They argue over the same scrap of land and who's turn it is to make humanity suffer. If I turn my back for one minute they'll both wipe the Earth clean of any small civilization that catches their eye.

I keep these Four Clowns of the Apocalypse in line with the plan. Glad I wasn't included with *that* name. I clean up their messes.

If it weren't for that sexist, lame-ass John of Patmos I'd have a foreboding name like the rest. Humanity would shudder at the thought of me and my plans.

[WP] Turns out there are 5 horsemen of the apocalypse. The one not recognized? The only female member of the team (which she finds incredibly offensive). She’s been waiting to set the record straight since.,UncleWenty,"There are Five Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Though one had been removed from human memory, ripped from every written passage.

My youngest brother Pestilence is still well known, riding out on his pure white horse. He wears a burnished white crown. Arrogant attire we thought but you must forgive that of youth. Wherever he rode, he fired his noxious arrows of disease into the hearts of men.

My second brother War is even more famous. A giant astride his flaming red horse, the ground itself shook at his passing. His blade, forged in the dying heart of star, butchered entire armies with one sweep. His power was unquestioned but his intelligence limited. Point him in a direction and destruction would follow.

Famine was my closest brother. Swathed in heavy dark robes and trotting through the world on his pure black steed, he was methodical. Calm. Deadly. Where he rode, whole crops died and with them, the people. You did not fear Famine on his approach. You mourned his name after he had gone.

My eldest brother needs no introduction. Death on his Pale horse. A sickly cream with a green tinge, the creature looked near skeletal. Fitting for my brother. He would walk the Earth and whole cities would fall silent at his whispered word. He was the great Thanatos, worthy of name beyond his duty. He was magnificent. And he betrayed me.

I am Time, the fifth of the Horsemen. I rode out on my amber steed, her skin the colour of sand. My own long hair flowed to the floor like dust, around my bronzed armour. My dominion was absolute and I ruled my brother's fairly, ensuring that everything was done at the correct Age, in keeping with the plan. A benevolent sister.

A millennia ago, Death conspired with my brothers. Poisoned them with words against me until one evening, as we rode the plains of Egypt, they enacted their treachery. 

Combined the four overcame me, bound me in a prison beyond the stars.

But I am Time and time holds no sway over me. I have waited, patient as the stone, as the sea. 

And soon I will be free.

[WP] Turns out there are 5 horsemen of the apocalypse. The one not recognized? The only female member of the team (which she finds incredibly offensive). She’s been waiting to set the record straight since.,UncleWenty,"The four of them are such pompous asses. Pestilence, Death, Wrath, and War think that true evil shines out of their asses.  Just because they command armies, bacteria, angry motherfuckers and the physical process of cell death, they think they can shit talk me.  ""*Oh, feelings can't hurt anyone! We can get rid of you with some Paxil and maybe a few years of therapy!*""   

Hi, by the way.  I'm Misery.  I guess you could consider me the exact personification of the anguish, malaise, and general awfulness that burdens every individual life.  If you want a visual, just imagine the soul-eating blackness that appears when you close your eyes when you're feeling the most miserable you've ever felt.  Really, though, I could take any form I want, since *I'm everywhere*.  

And yes, impenetrable darkness punctuated by the deepest heartache doesn't *have a gender* in the traditional human understanding of the term, but I identify as a woman.  If that bothers you, then ask yourself: if War, Pestilence, Death and Wrath have no genders, why are they called Horse*men* and not just *Hell's Riders* or whatever?  Beats me.  Either way, if you feel the slightest bit of unease at how I express what I know my gender to be, then that says more about your puny human perceptions of unknowable horror than it does about the legitimacy of what I feel the need to express.      

I've been at every suicide, overdose, accidental death, car accident, state-sponsored genocide, broken arm, successful birth, miscarriage, and every case of severe depression that's ever happened.  I am suffering itself.  

My brothers think they're hot shit because they can make people die in a hundred different ways, but in reality, they're just the opening act.  You can give terminal cancer to the angriest soldier in the hospital, but it won't matter unless I chip in.  Nothing my brothers have accomplished has had any meaning without me.  And you know what? Wars end. Diseases are cured.  Anger cools down.  And yeah, Death happens all the time (as he'll fucking remind me every time I see him; acts like he's the only one of us that has a job) but it doesn't have any meaning to anyone without the sting of suffering.  The four of them could set the whole world on fire and nothing would come of it if people didn't suffer.  

They need a lot of reminding that I'm their equal.  For example, when Pestilence decides to start an epidemic, I'll let up and allow some heroic scientist to overcome their horror and cure the entire thing.  He still hasn't forgiven me for Jonas Salk.

Ever notice how there are twenty billion songs about sadness, but not a single one that extols the virtues of disease, anger, or war? It annoys my brothers to no end to remember that I'm the one that gets immortalized.  [My fans make the best art](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwjGytOVVQA).  In fact, I think that's the reason they act like such jerks around me.  They're insecure. They sicken, enrage, murder and enlist thousands daily, but I'm the one that's remembered.  I'm the real threat, since I'm felt long after the battlefields, sick wards, arguments, and funerals become distant memories.  I'm just around the corner of every human life.  I'm Misery, and without me, nothing hurts.

It started slow enough, one cut-rate psychic in Brooklyn reported unusual headaches, slowly turning to migraines. Doctors couldn't figure it out. Priests couldn't figure it out.      

When the first genuine telepath showed up, the whole world changed. He could read minds, and then some. Slowly, the gates started opening. Telepaths, telekinetics, general psychics. Eventually the field of psionics started to mature, develop. Nobody ever could figure out why that lone psychic’s headaches started.   

Then it happened. One by one, all the psions reported headaches. The same, terrible symptoms. Headaches to migraines to suicide. It was agony. It stripped them of all pleasure in life, all joy. They became empty husks, bitter shells of former humans. Death was the only reported relief, and they were far too overjoyed to take it. 
    
This seems to have slowed the spread, but it wasn’t until 30 years we had discovered the root cause.

I can't quite remember when the last patrol left to scout no man's land, and nor can I remember their names.

3 miles away in an opposing trench, a German soldier sits in a heap. On his hand is a large gash which throbs with the beat of his heart and trickles white fluid slowly down his raised arm. When the last can opener snapped he had desperately tried to open the canned rations and cut himself deeply. Without antibiotics he was destined to a slow spiral to death. He had given up on walking the trench a week ago when he started to feel a fever over take his skeletal body. For a month now, he had been without any form of human contact.

"[WP] In an alternate world, WWI continued until today. One Hundred and four years after it started, it finally ends. This is the story of how “The Greatest War” ended.",mcgrathc09,"They say it ended, but a war this long never really has an end. When war spills into the next generation, it simply becomes a way of life.

If there was an “end”, so to speak, it *would* be today - the day the last of the old countries fell and the last of the old borders were wiped off the map.

To be honest, no one down here even knows about it, nor would they care. When you spend nine hours out of everyday breathing dust and spitting blood, national news updates fall pretty fucking low on the list of priorities. That and I was the only one in five miles with a working CB.

Ours was a tribal existence - and the collapse of the last of the old guard nary made a dent in our newfound way of life. The announcement itself was almost an insult. “Hey you out there! Guess what? If you ever had any hope of things getting better - they won’t!” Buddy, I gave up on that shit two weeks outta the womb, and there ain’t no sunshine when it’s gone. 

This is just another Sunday for me.

"[WP] Filthy rich and bored, your latest project is creating a hotel that terrifies guests while keeping an impeccable five star rating.",rm-minus-r,"On opening day of your new hotel, thousands of the highest elite and hopefull middleclass families show up, but not all will get to stay. You wouldn't let any reservations be made- today, you pick your victims. 13, to be exact. The 653 remaining rooms will go on a first come, serve basis. 
You watch over the crowd from a balcony. The US president is here with her whole family. You point here out to one of the impeccably dressed bellhops standing by you. He hurries down and makes it through the crowd, although it will some time to get through the secret service.
Next up is a young couple, the girl clearly pregnant. Then a small group of movie stars, a large family with six kids and and a couple of aunt's, a girl scout troop, and several others until all 13 bellhops have gone.
Now, to prepare.

It is suprisingly easy to get 13 people out of their rooms, even though you work alone. Just pump in some sleeping gas, and fetch them while everyone is knocked out. It takes almost two hours, but soon all are fast asleep on the basement floor. The hidden elevators and passages were a huge help.
The pregnant girl, the president's teenage daughter, a movie star, a boy from a clearly poor family, a farmer, someone's grandma, a toddler, an overworked mom, a you tube vlogger, Olympic gymnast, a guy from France, a journalist from London, and your own annoying little sister.
They don't know each other. Some may be recognizable, but it shouldn't be too much of an issue.
You head to your control room, relieved to take the gas mask off. The people you can see from your one way window will wake up soon. Crystal clear security cameras show up on surrounding screens.
Sure enough, not even a minute goes by before the first stairs and opens their eyes- the toddler. He seems confused, but starts wailing once realizing his mother is not there.
That wakes the others up real quick.
Suprisingly, your sister seems the least fazed and takes charge before the others have even figured out that they aren't in bed. What a control freak.
It is 15 long minutes before they get over the shock. Still confused as hell, but accepting of the fact that they are indeed in a dark room full of strangers.
This room is pretty empty. It is all concrete, save for some moss and flickering flouresent lights. The hidden doors are undetectable, and only two giant rusty steel doors remain visible on opposite sides of the room.
Your sister has tried both the doors, but obviously they are locked.
The pregnant girl is actually holding and comforting the toddler, which might have warmed your heart if you had one. The farmer was helping the grandma up, while the others introduced themselves and tried not to panic.
Once they seemed to have grouped together enough, you flip the first switch. Immidatly, a huge banging comes from one of the sets of doors. The group stupidly yells for help, thinking that whatever is coming must be some kind of rescue team. Can't have that.
You type in a quick command, and the door warps like whatever is on the other side punched it hard enough to bend.
Another warp and bang, and the group is clawing at the opposite door. You wait a moment, then unlock both at once. They run through as a huge figure starts to come in.
But you slam the door with just one left in the room.
The YouTube vlogger just wasn't fast enough- even the old lady beat him.
You chuckle as the dark shawdowy creature turns and approaches the internet star. The others are yelling that they can't get the door open.
In reality, the monster is a mound of pitch black fake fur on several remote controlled cars. Not super complex, but in the dim light the 'creature' looks like a horrifying swirily mass. Your victims let's out a blood curling scream, just as the thing is upon him... And you hit a button to send a tranquilizer straight into him. It works perfectly, and he is knocked out.
You turn to see the others on camera. Several are crying, while the rest explore this new room. It looks like an abandoned Victorian family room, with old wooden doors. Even the one they came through is wood on this side.
You don't hesitate to start. With a flick of your wrist, the room begins to shake. Dusty paintings fall off the wall. Furniture crumbles. The victims fall down. The lights go out.
With a crash, you have a door fly open but when the lights come back on, it becomes clear to them that this will not be easy to get through.
The floor of the next room it several feet above this one, and the opening from there to the top of the doorway is narrow.
Stunned, everyone shakily gets up to survey the damage. No one is harmed of course- I can't afford to leave marks.
They still need an incentive to continue, though. So, que the banging from where they came. None of them saw the hair-monster, so the thing chasing them is still unknown.
They once again scramble to leave with out talking to one another. They are much less friendly now, the poor boy and movie star both shoving the others aside to get through. Soon, only the toddler, grandma, pregnant girl, and the mom remain- those too weak to climb up. Your sister and the farmer are trying to pull the others up, but to no avail.
You begin the shaking again, and on both sides the victims fall away from the gap. The Victorian room suddenly slants down, and the gap is closed.
The 4 remaining look like a terrified family with several generations. The toddler is screaming again- ugh- and the others pathetically cower.
The doors of doom open, and out of the dark come three little walking corpses, little girls in Victorian dresses with flesh rotting off. Puppets, of course, but very good ones. Can't even see the strings.
Giggling erupts from hidden speaker all around, and screaming ensues. This is more tricky, since all need to be knocked out at the same time. But oddly, no one runs. Is it that they are resigned to their date, or are they simply frozen in fear? Hmm. Interesting.
As soon as the puppets touch them, the tiny needles in the hands stick into the 3 women and the child. This one will burn for a few moments as it spreads throughout their body- not bad, but enough to make it seem like the corpses touch has infected them. Soon though, all are asleep.
The third room is your favorite. Unlike the others, it is very bright and clean. It resembles an infirmary, but many of the tools on the Marple block in the middle are strange. Round windows lie here and there, with projections of space on the other side. Glowing blue markings exist next to the only remaining door, now that the other has fallen away. 
Your sister, for the first time, looks defeated. You laugh so hard you cry- finally! You broke her!
The poor boy seems facinated by the instruments. He reaches out for one, but the journalist stops him. Probably a smart move.
You actually sit back and leave them alone for a bit. It's up to them now.
It's 20 minutes before anyone even tries the door. It has no handle or hinges, since it slides, and those who are there push it helplessly.
The farmer finally ttys touching the blue markings. Whew. You were starting to get bored.
The lights turn red and alarms blare. After so long with nothing happening, the group panics again. Someone hides behind the marble, while the farmer actually tries playing dead.
You type a command. A previously unnoticed hatch above them opens, and smoke starts filling the room. It took you forever to figure out how to actually give it the sulfuric green look. It doesn't smell, but it does have traced of what he used earlier to get them from their rooms. They cover their mouths and couph, growing more and more sluggish.
It is hilarious.
Finally, you slide the door open. They all hurry back, expecting something to come through, but nothing does. The movie star collapses, followed by the farmer.
Only your sister makes it out. How freakishly stubborn of her. Ahh, well, she gets the final surprise.
Once her eyes clear and she stops coughing, she finally looks around.
She stands in a movie theater, completely empty. A spotlight shines on a single seat in the middle. It's the only one that isn't locked in the up position.
Exhausted, she stumbles over and sits down. Her mind is too foggy to do otherwise. Popcorn and soda appear next to her, but she doesn't take any.
Rude.
You smile. It's kinda of fitting that your sister gets the final horror.
The spotlight turns off, and the screen lights up. Cheesy music begins to play. Numbers count down on the screen.
The image flashes up, and it takes her several long moments to realize what it is of.
Her husband, daughter, and baby son sleeping soundly in their hotel room... Only several floors above her. This isn't actually current- it's from right after you took her. You had to use some video editing skills for this one. CGI, green screen... You had most of it ready to go to be placed into any of the ""survivors"" Family's feed, but each required some specific special effects. None of them were very good, but she was still recoving from the gas.
A few moments in, a shadowy figure enters. Your sister stands, transfixed. The form approaches her sleeping husband... And plunges a gleaming knife into his heart. Blood goes everywhere. It is so fake, but she screams and runs towards the screen. You watch her as her children undorgo similar treatment.
Once it ends, she is on floor, sobbing. No fight left. Broken.
You smile and flood the room with gas. Time to clean up.

The next morning, you watch as your guests leave. Hundreds of people are ranting about how good and amazing their stay was. A few families faces walk out holding their loved ones close.
Your sister comes up to you.
""How was your stay?"" You ask.
She smiles, but huge bags are under her eyes. ""It's pretty nice. Thanks for letting me stay here.""
You frown at her, mostly to hide a smirk. ""Is something wrong?""
""No...no, just a bad dream. It felt so real..."" She gives you a weak hug and walks away.
You can't wait to do it again next week.

[WP] A story about how the soviet army killed god in the 1950's,Hjack909090,"One twist more and the engineer named Gennadiy Nikolayevich, feels the burden in his bladder relieve. Shaking, but already smelling the fear begin to dry inside his suit, the good news is he lived. He checks the seal. The torque is perfect right down to the square millimeter. This last step made the collection of materials gathered together one of the biggest atom splitting devices known to man. 

He watches the gauge for a moment until satisfied and says into his suit's microphone, ""Pressure maintaining."" 

""Da! Very good Comrade."" returns a voice in the room with him. 

He turns expecting another engineer in a radiation suit instead his mouth falls open. Not only was the base's new commanding general in the clean room with him unprotected, but the motherless whore was smoking. 

That alone should have killed them. 

He wants to scream that a single spark of static could send this whole facility to hell, but an errant bead of sweat drips from his brow that makes his whole body shiver with goosepimples. 

Or maybe it was a small jolt of electricity that glued his lips shut.

Either or it was enough time to watch a nightmare unfold.

The general is a short man with a wide round belly and tiny little legs sprouting from underneath. He wears a tent of green wool cut into the proper military style. He smokes a Belomorkanal. Gennadiy can tell by the obvious piping near the cardboard spacer at the bottom. With one more drag the general flicks the foot. It flies from his blackened fingers and hits the floor. 

Orange sparks fly.

Gennadiy flinches expecting a painful death.

Or was that a stabbing electrical pulse running up his spine that made his brain skip several seconds forward?

For a brief moment, nothing else happens. 

Gennadiy sighs audibly and raises his hand to wipe at the sweat on his brow forgetting that he is encased in a radiation suit. 

The unexpected plastic barrier makes a dong noise as he hits it and he knocks himself backward on legs suddenly gone rubbery. Quickly he reaches out a hand and grabs at the pressure cap he just sat for support.

The resulting hiss makes what's in Gennadiy's bladder come pouring out without warning. The piss slooshes down his leg and fills his rubber boots. He takes one sloshing step, losses his balance and falls just in time to see half the building rip. 

Rip is the only way he can describe it. What was, now is on the outskirts of a black void, or nothingness that swirls with the potential of everything. Its math and biology a living potential, somehow everything but nothing.   

Maybe a tear can simplify it because the whole of the situation is that the reality Gennadiy is used to has split open like the seat of a pair of a fat man's pants. Pieces of the general's shredded face flap as if strings on frayed fabric. 

He looks as if he is in mid-word.

With one blink of his wide terror-filled eyes, a man appears. Or really what might be considered man-shaped. It wears a robe flowing with living blood. It stands on the void with goat hooves. It turns a giant goat head and stares at Gennadiy with square black eyes that swirl with every star in the universe. 

After taking a long slow look at the engineer the creature opens it rage snarled mouth to speak and a bolt of fire shoots free. 

While melting into a puddle of human, Gennadiy is certain the word the being spoke to kill him was, ""Hi,"" and that just before his eyes pop in the sudden inferno he sees the creature's face crumble in disappointment.

Which in that smallest fraction of time means nothing to Gennadiy as he joins history as a moment that was.

"[WP] The Fellowship of the Ring has a new member: a moody, social media obsessed teenager.",MaskMacabre,"Strider stared at the ground for a long while. To Sam, it felt like three forevers. At last he rose. ""They came this way,"" he said, ""but much time has passed since. We should be safe to camp here.""  
  
""Good,"" said Pippin, ""Then we shall build a proper fire at last, and have a hot meal and a comfortable sleep!""  
  
""No fires,"" Strider said. ""We do not dare make such a sign to tell of our whereabouts.""  
  
Pippin frowned, and Sam put away the pot he had begun removing from his pack. ""You said yourself they are long gone,"" he argued. ""We shall waste away to nothing at this rate!""  
  
""I am sure no such fate awaits you, my little halfling friend,"" Strider said.  
  
Frodo, long silent, chuckled then, a sound so sudden and unexpected that Strider and all three hobbits turned to look at him. His face, however, was pointed not at Strider, nor at Sam's belly, but at the parchment in his lap. As usual, the minute they had stopped, he had perched himself upon a rock and brought forth parchment and quill.  
  
""Frodo,"" Strider said, then waited for an answer that did not come.  
  
""FRODO,"" he said more loudly.  
  
""God, WHAT?"" Frodo said, not looking up. ""I can hear you just fine, you don't have to yell.""  
  
""You and I will take first watch.""  
  
""Fine,"" Frodo said, his eyes still not leaving the parchment.  
  
""I will watch the north and east sides of the hill, and you the south and west,"" Strider instructed.  
  
""Whatever,"" Frodo sighed.  
  
""Begging your pardon, Mr. Frodo,"" said Sam, ""But what are you writing?""  
  
""I'm not writing,"" Frodo said, annoyed. ""Uncle Bilbo writes. I'm *tweeting*.""  
  
""What's tweeting?"" Sam asked innocently. Frodo exhaled sharply.  
  
""Not right now, Sam. I'll explain it later. Just go make your fire or whatever.""  
  
""No fire!"" shouted Strider. ""We don't want to attract attention!""  
  
""So don't make a fire. I don't care,"" Frodo said. He had stopped moving his quill. ""What do we have to eat?""  
  
""I've some dried bacon left in my pack,"" said Sam, ""or some berries I picked while we were walking this afternoon."" He started opening his pack. Frodo reached in and snatched some bacon, then turned his back to the group and began writing again.  
  
.....  
  
Sam felt himself being shaken awake. ""Wake up, Sam,"" a voice whispered, ""they've come."" Before his eyes were all the way open, Sam was being pulled to his feet and Strider was thrusting a torch into his hand. After much complaining, mostly by Pippin (and some by Frodo when he could be bothered to say anything at all), Strider had relented and allowed the hobbits to build their fire. That appeared to have been a mistake, as now he was organizing them into a circular formation to defend their camp.  
  
""I don't know how many there are,"" Strider was saying, ""Certainly not all nine, or they would have attacked by now and be long gone with the ring. Our little fire and small daggers would be no match for the full force of the nine together. I am hoping they will be enough for however many are out there now.""  
  
""How do you even know there are any,"" Frodo asked. ""All I hear is wind. This is stupid. I want to go back to sleep.""  
  
""Hush!"" snapped Strider. ""There are at least three, and they will be upon us before you know.""  
  
And just like that, they saw the first of the Black Riders; tall, hooded, and black, it stood at the far side of the hill. Sam felt his heart racing, and then there were three, emerging from the dark, just to the edge of their firelight.  
  
""Stay close,"" Strider said in a low voice, ""Do not allow them to break the circle.""  
  
In the end, there proved to be five Ringwraiths. Sam fought as hard as he could, but his was skill with shovel and rake, not with dagger and flame, and before he knew what was happening, Frodo had been stabbed and Strider had driven off their attackers. Sam found himself away from the group, hunting for Kingsfoil weed, which Strider had called by its elven name of *Athelas*. Over and over again in his mind, he kept replaying the scene. They had fought as hard as they could. Even Frodo had put up a fight, but as Strider had predicted, their weapons were no match for their attackers. And then, suddenly, Frodo had seemed to disappear, and all five turned to where he had stood. They rushed in and Sam would swear he had heard Frodo cry out before Strider charged at the wraiths with his torch in hand. And now Frodo was unconscious and Strider was doing what he could to keep him alive.  
  
Sam spotted the kingsfoil and pulled as much as he could carry, then returned to the hilltop, where he saw Strider leaning over Frodo. Merry and Pippin were perched on Frodo's rock, reading from the parchment he had been writing on earlier. ""Hoy, Sam!"" Merry shouted, ""Come listen to this!""  
  
Sam gave the weed to Strider and went to see what the other hobbits were talking about. ""Listen,"" said Merry, ""It's some kind of journal or something.""  
  
""A journal, yes,"" said Pippin, ""but more like notes for a journal. It's all short fragments and nonsense.""  
  
Sam peered at the parchment.  
  
*Weathertop blows. Strider is such a dick.* read the first line.  
  
*Say no to crack LOL* read the second line, and beside it, Frodo had drawn a crude sketch of a hobbit bending over, the crease of his backside peeking out from atop the waistline of his breeches. Underneath the sketch, Frodo had written *Sam picking berries*.  
  
More nonsense followed.  
  
*Want to go back to Bombadil's crib. Mofo got the best shit. 420 blaze it!*  
*@TheRealGandalf Why can't you just take this fucking ring to Elrond yourself?*  
*@BIGREDEYE Come get it bitch! You ain't safe in my hood.*  
*Tired of being such a nice guy when chicks just want assholes. Stupid bitch deserves the Miller's son.*  
  
""SAM!"" shouted Strider, ""Get over here now and hold this leaf on the wound!"" Sam shook his head at the parchment and wandered over to his injured friend.",percygreen

"[WP] A college frat party, except it’s narrated like a nature documentary.",Native_CSGO,"On today's episode of Planet College, we take foot in a new terrain, the Frat House. Many organisms are known to dwell in this climate. Micro\-colonies grow within the confines of the kitchen where a young Pledgling will soon destroy them as the Frat Brother shows dominance by making them clean their quarters. This kind of activity is only shown when a female Sorority Sister may be making her presence. So begins the mating ritual of the College Colonists. We will return later in the episode to examine life in the Frat House.

...

Welcome back to the Frat House, as you can now see many colours are adorned on the front to entice mates into the building. A repetitive sound can be heard from the street, a welcoming sound to all Sorority Sisters. Inside the house we can see the Pledglings mixing drinks and delivering them to the alpha males. They may hope to mate tonight but they must impress their Frat Brothers first. There are many rules to be followed in the Frat hierarchy with the rules around mating being the most sacred of all. 

As the females enter, the highest of the Frat Brothers begin to swoop in, thrusting their hips and offering drinks in a clear display of the mating ritual. Those who are lucky will gain their mate for the rest of the night, those who are not so lucky will continue to thrust and drink into the early hours. Some Brothers will take on the role of jester tonight, stumbling and shouting in an attempt to make the females laugh. This might work for some but most will be disappointed.

...

The night is nearly over now. Most pairings have made their way to quieter corners whilst a few brothers continue the festivities in the garden. A lost female pledgling has stumbled into the herd. Like a gazelle in a pack of lions, she must be quick if she wishes to escape. Alas, one brother has caught her and begins to make her laugh. This may mark the end for her as she agrees to another drink and heads towards the house. Just as she does an older sister appears. With protest from the sister pledgling, she is able to pull her away and they leave by foot. It appears both brother and pledgling will be unhappy tonight however the experience of the older sister will save humiliation in the morning.

With that interaction we must leave them. This is where the night ends for us but the Frat House will be active until the morning. From us at Planet College, we wish you a good evening. Goodbye. ",UndercoverDumbledore

One day every celestial object becomes blue-shifted.",RazeLegendz,"(I don’t know really anything about NASA, and I have a basic understanding of Astronomy, so please be nice. And I did this for fun at work when we were slow with nothing to do.)


It was a normal day at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. Or at least, it had started out that way. 

Dale Richardson, one of the many astronomers that worked there, was having his lunch break. He was eating leftover pizza from the night before when his colleague, Paul Foster, walked into the room. 

“Hey, Dale. You should come take a look at this.” Paul sad, seeming nervous, which was common. Having joined the team of astronomers shortly after graduating with a Master of Science in Physics, he had not yet gained confidence in himself. Dale worked closely with him, and usually Paul would ask for advice on anything new that he had found. Except, Paul had never asked Dale during his lunch period. 

“Can it wait until after lunch? I only have like 15 minutes left.” Dale responded, taking another large bite of his pizza. 

Paul shook his head, with a slight look of panic in his eyes. “I don’t think so. I think this is urgent.” 

Squinting his eyes at the younger man, Dale put down his half-eaten pizza slice. “What could be so urgent that it cannot wait 15 minutes?” 

“It just… It just is. You just have to see it, please.” 

Dale paused for a moment and then sighed, and got up from the break room table to follow the man out of the room towards the lab, where computers and large monitors. Specifically, they were monitoring satellites that had large space telescopes within them. These satellites would send back information, which was often vital for new space discoveries and the occasional cool photo of a faraway star or a gaseous exploding star. 

Usually, it was all normal information, with the occasional excitement, as space is often doing interesting things. But there was never usually a reason for panic. 

Walking over to a computer, Paul sat down in front of it and was pointing at something on the screen. “One of our satellites has picked something up that seems to be heading towards Earth.” Paul was talking fast, and indicating the blue mark on the screen. 

“Is it another meteorite?” Meteorites hit the Earth every day, with a lot of people not even noticing them, since they were so small. 

“I don’t think so… I think it is bigger… And not like a meteor bigger, but like… I think. I think it’s a planet.” 

It took a second for Dale to choke down the scoff that almost erupted from his mouth. “A planet? You think a planet is coming towards us? How is that even possible?” It was hard to keep the incredulous tone out of his voice. Paul had mostly been correct with his statements in his time working for NASA, but had never assumed anything this crazy. 

“Yes… Yes, I do. But… But there is something more.” 

This time Dale did let out a snort, “Oh, and what’s that?” 

“You know how we were tracking that one star out in deep space?” 

“Yeah? What about it?”

“It changed direction suddenly… It is now coming towards us, as well.” Paul said, sweat appearing on his brow. 

Dale looked at the computer screen once again, and sure enough, the star that they had been focusing on to hopefully get a picture of was blue-shifted and was set on a trajectory towards the Milky Way, and specifically, the Earth. 

Now Paul was talking super fast “And when I started widening the scope… it, I mean, it… Just look.” Paul pressed a few buttons and zoomed out the scope of the telescope and the information on the screen broadened. 

All the celestial objects, stars, planets, everything, were marked in blue. 

For a moment, Dale stood, stunned. Then just shook his head. “It has to be the system. We are getting the wrong information.” 

Paul shook his head. “I don’t think so. I rebooted it, and it still shows the same thing.” 

Dale thought about what day it was. It was May 5th, 2021. It seemed too late for an April Fools joke. But with how nervous Paul was, he didn’t think anyone could fake it. 

Picking up the phone, he called to another lab. Hoping that maybe the other satellites were okay, and it just happened to be a fluke in their system. It would not be the first time. 

The phone rang for almost too long, before a rather flustered man answered the phone. It took a second for Dale to recognize the voice. “Yes… yes, hello? What do you need?” 

“Is everything okay, Craig?” Dale asked, feeling his stomach slowly drop. 

“What? Um… Not really, there is… Is this Dale?”

“Yes, it’s Dale. I was just calling to ask if you could pick up on some other satellites a planet and a star that were blue-shifted…” 

When he mentioned blue-shifted, Craig began to laugh, a really strange and nervous laughter. 

“Ha. What isn’t blue-shifted right now? That is what I want to know. What isn’t blue-shifted and heading straight for our galaxy?” 

“… what do you mean?” 

“I mean that everything is heading for us. Literally everything. Every celestial body. We cannot tell anyone without sending the entire world into a complete panic. It is as if the universe is literally collapsing upon us.” 

In a state of almost incomprehension, Dale responded. “But, it can’t be… the universe is infinitely expanding. Forever.” 

“Not anymore.” 

Dale held the phone up to his ear for a few more seconds, before hanging up gently. He was in full-blown shock now, but he turned to look at Paul who was looking up at him with large panicked eyes.

Not knowing what else to say, Dale laughed humorlessly and said.

"[WP] you are abducted and studied by an alien race who believe you to be barely sentient, you decide to play along.",kiingkiller,"The suckerfish fellers fashioned a voicebox doohicky to the base of Clive's neck and asked, ""How do you feel?""

Clive spat and said they're starting to sound like his wife. 

Their saucership was, admittedly, pretty damn sleek--full 'a flashing lights and fancy tilefloor you typically find in one of them supermarts--but you'd never catch Clive acknowledging that fact. His father was a sonnofabitch, but Clive wagered the one good thing he'd taught him was the tried and true Callahan tradition of keeping your goddamned mouth shut. Those days when he was still a little snotsain, running around without any trousers, his father would beat him if he whined about a scraped knee. He'd be goddamned if he were about to cry about being *abducted*. Hell, they'd actually saved him from another therapy session with Mary Sue.

""Think very carefully now,"" another suckerfish said. This one's mouth reminded him of a crappie's, all wide and gaping like it was gaspin' for air. ""Do you ever feel *happy*?""

""Hell if I know,"" Clive grumbled. ""Watching the Boys play on Sunday sometimes I guess. Less they're talking about that kneeling nonsense.""

The suckerfish's googly eyes swiveled in their sockets. ""You mean to say you establish familial bonds? That establishing a family dynamic and observing your children grow and evolve brings you a deep-founded sense of satisfaction and joy?""

They all stood on their flippertoes, which discharged a strange ooze amid their excitement. 

Clive simply shrugged. 

""I don't really know what the hell yer askin' me,"" he said. ""But I ain't got no damn kids.""

This sent the creatures into a frenzy. One group a' slimy ones seemed adamant on pushing a big gleamin' button that looked straight from the sciencey movies Clive liked to watch. The ones starring Bruce Willis or some other badass who saved the fate of the world. The other group discharged more goop and said something about hookin' Clive up to a bunch 'a wires and shit. ""Would you mind?"" said the crappie-mouth. ""This is very important.""

""Hell, I don't care,"" Clive said. ""Just don't touch my goods."" The suckerfish strapped him all up and paid close attention to a few squiggly screens. Just a bunch of gibberish, as far as Clive was concerned.

After a while of just straight *nothing*, Clive asked, ""Ya'll got any chew?""

The suckerfish fellers ignored him. They flopped on over and said, ""Good sir. Your species has spanned the entirety of your planet. A planet on which the Order intends to invoke imminent domain. Answer truthfully now. Do you acknowledge that you feel?"".

""Chriiiist almighty,"" Clive said. ""Mary Sue been on this grind for weeks. She slip me an ambien or something?""

The suckerfish tilted his head. ""You're saying you don't feel anything at all?""

Clive spat.

""I'm a *man*,"" he said simply. ""Feelings just aint for us.""

The suckerfish burped. ""Very well,"" it said. 

Then the others pushed the big gleamin' button. 

All the windows started shaking and clamorin'. A big laserbeam streak shot off into the darkness of space and ballooned into a brilliant explosion like them big rig fireworks Clive took Mary Sue to see on their very first pow wow. That had been a fun time. He'd cracked open a few Keystones and she'd smiled and shotgunned hers in one fell swoop. When she laughed and pointed as one of the firework bits caught onto some sagebrush and blossomed into a brushfire, Clive had smiled and thought, *I gotta marry this one.* 

This put that shit to shame though. Clive squinted through all the light. Bits of sparkler smoke drifted around all crazy like, sending Clive's heart a'pumpin. 

The machiney-beepers booped. The squiggle screens went so crazy that Clive felt the wires strapped to his arms actually glow warm. The fish fellers scrambled around, squawking like a group of ducks. Several of them fixed their googly eyes on him, flippertoes practically turned to a faucet of goop. 

""HOO boy!"" Clive said excitedly, as the suckerfish gaped at him in dismay. ""Now *that*'s a helluvalot of firepower!""

"[WP] you are abducted and studied by an alien race who believe you to be barely sentient, you decide to play along.",kiingkiller,"I stared down at the printouts, blinking slowly.  Dumbly.  As though I couldn't comprehend any of what I was seeing.

""Take your time,"" the creature across from me cooed.  They were spindle-thin, with too many fingers and too many eyes and too many legs.  Completely and totally alien - which was only to be expected, after all.

Alien abduction was something that happened to *other* people - crazy people living in trailers out in the woods, complaining about the fluoride in city water and the government satellites spying on them in their homes.  Not *me*.

I'd learned otherwise.

""I...don't know,"" I said, furrowing my brow carefully.  The alien across from me sighed, unable to mask its smile.  Gaelinin, I'd been told to call it.

""That's fine.  It's fine,"" it said.  I understood every word, somehow, despite the fact that its reedy, wind-chime voice should only sound like meaningless, nonsensical noises.

They'd...done something to me.  I couldn't remember.  But when I'd awoken, my head was shaved, and there were scars all over my scalp.  They'd put something in me.  I didn't know quite what, but we could understand each other.

""I'm tired,"" I said plaintively, fixing the alien with my biggest puppy-dog eyes.  ""Can I go back to my room?""

Its skin flushed in the way it always seemed to when it was happy.  ""Oh.  Just a little more, Sam.  Just one more.  Here.  Could you solve this problem for me?""

It slid another sheet across to me.  I looked down carefully, deliberately slowly.

*X=4*

*(2X+10)/2 = ?*

Inwardly, I groaned.  More middle-school math.  They kept doing this - checking and double checking my mental acuity, my speed, as though they couldn't quite believe the results they were getting.

I stared down at the numbers, pressing my nose closer inch by inch.

""Is it six?"" I said, pursing my lips as I looked back at Gaelinin.

It made the hissing, gasping noise that was its laughter, then held a many-fingered hand up like it was trying to hide the expression.  It was a bit of humanity I wouldn't have expected.

""Oh...I'm so stupid,"" I said slowly.

""No.  It's fine, Sam.  Why don't you go back to your room, now?"" Gaelinin's voice said soothingly.

My collar beeped.  I swallowed hard.  That meant I could leave - I could exit the test chambers.  Thank god.  I'd seen what their device could do, and I could never quite rest easy until I knew it had gone into 'rest' mode.

The fact I'd seen what it could do was the reason I was playing this damn stupid game, after all.

I rose, my motions wooden and slow, and slipped into the hall.  The panel on the wall beeped, letting Gaelinin know it had locked onto me - following me.  They'd let me walk myself home, at least.  Why not?  Where was I going to *go*?  I stepped from the room, letting the door slide shut behind me.

The sound of screaming echoed down the hallway.  They weren't human - I knew that much.  I hadn't seen any other humans on this ship, in fact.  But I'd seen them through the windows of their test chambers.

The sight of them as I'd first been pulled into Gaelinin's room had put me into such a shock that I'd been dumbfounded, frozen solid.  The tubes hanging from their arms, the way they writhed as the system put them through test after test after test - pushing them farther and farther, finding their limits of mental and physical acuity.

I hadn't realized it at the time, but that very dumbfounded reaction had saved me.

The door slid shut behind me as I stepped into my room - tiny, windowless, and bare.  There was no doorknob.  I was little more than an animal to them, after all - just a curiosity.

But they wouldn't expect greatness out of an animal.  They wouldn't do the things to *me* that they'd done to the rest of their subjects.

And animals wouldn't be considered a threat.  Humanity would be safe.  Wherever Earth was.  I had to hope that we were still close, at least.

It had better be.  When I made my escape, I wanted to go *home*.

Slowly, carefully, I ran the plan over in my mind again.  The little device Gaelinin wore on its belt would do the trick - I'd seen it open the forbidden doors.  The caretaker wouldn't expect it from me, and that gave me an opening.

If I failed, the game would be up.  The aftermath would be...*unpleasant* for me.  I was sure of that much.

But I had to try.  I wasn't going to stay here forever.

Sliding my eyes shut, I pushed the doubts away.

There was only the plan.  That was all.

And it was nearly time.

I get the impression he no longer takes pride in his appearance and as a result has very few interactions with the females of his species. Categorically, I would describe this whopper as a terminal loser, sir,” said Gipgarn, turning and smiling at the other Droop’nons in the room to make sure his joke landed.

“Gipgarn, I will not have you talking in front of subjects in this manner,” said Emperor Rognok, who had followed Gipgarn around the table, pointing at the subjects limbs in order to give the illusion he knew what he was doing.

“Sir, although the subject is living it is devoid of sentience. We can say whatever we want in confidence,” said Klib’thor, his head poking around a large monitor on the far side of the room.

The Emperor held out both his hands and let rip a large smile. “You should have mentioned this earlier. I would have roasted this ugly joke the second I walked in to the room.”

The room fell in to laugher. 

“He has a face like a bag of smashed twats, sir,” said Gipgarn.

“Haha – good one, Gipgarn. I imagine we do not have to worry about timeframes on this project. Not a chance anyone is out looking for this sack of shit,” replied the Emperor, pointing at the body.

The monitor in front of Klib’thor began to flash.

“Everyone quiet!” urged Klib’thor, his eyes locked on the screen. “This is bad.”

“Spit it out, Klib’thor!” ordered the Emperor.

“According to the readings, the subject can hear what we are saying.”

“Dear God. Please don’t tell me,” mumbled Emperor Rognok.

“He’s taking offence, sir,” said, Klib’thor, peering up at Rognok.

Emperor Rognok fled in to the seat next to Klib’thor and began to peer at his monitor. “Status report. Now.”

“It’s bad, sir. From our recent studies of the humans, we know that causing offence is one of the most deplorable crimes on the planet. On Earth, you’re not allowed to offend anyone.”

“What have we done?” said the Emperor, reclining in to his seat, one of his heads wrapped in his 14 hands. “How did we allow this to happen?!”

“I don’t know, sir. I can only imagine that the subjects stupidity fooled our initial cyber pat down. Our systems told us the subject was devoid of sentience,” explained Gipgarn, joining them at the monitor.

“So we have offended a stupid human?” asked Klib’thor.

“The worst kind of human to offend,” said Emperor Rognok, gazing out of the window in shock. “There must be a way to reverse it. Tell me there is a way we can fix this.”

The information on Klib’thor’s screen whirled as he rifled through the file on 21st century human behaviour.

“The only known method we have on our database is to send out an apology tweet, sir. It almost never ever works but it’s the go to method of the human.”

'Wouldn't want any ugly scratches on her before her 15 minutes of fame, now,' he finished with a chortle. I found myself standing outside the facility's entrance, timecard in hand, watching my coworkers melt down in the parking lot together. I could only watch them with a sort of pithy compassion as I stowed my new equipment in the trunk. The evening seemed to pass like molasses, so I invited my wife to a stay-at-home outing with some delivery. We both poured a rather irresponsible bit of scotch for ourselves and enjoyed the first Matrix movie while I showed our daughter the machine from work. Given how she's coming around 'that age', me and the Mrs.  crack a few open with her and berate the next to installments while we're gathered around the equipment. Shortly, after the house had fallen silent, I dreamt of what otherworldly places I had been to the morning before. I heard my name, distant and discordant, floating across fluid to my dreamt ears. I awoke, broken into cold sweat, draped longingly across the apparatus like a Renaissance painting. I stroked it momentarily before I felt it hum, slightly so, in response to my thoughts. It brought to me a simple quest deep in mine; wealth. Made quickly apparent to me, I stole into the night, calling the director once I reached the parking lots outside the facility. I told him I'd thought of something that'll close our deficit, and, as I'd suspected, he was quick in his arrival. I told him I'd seen people like us, trapped in machines, people dear to us. He took to the bait, and soon wasn't long for this world. I watched him disappear in a shaft of phase, leaving his worldy possessions entirely behind him. A small, laminated ID tag rocketed through the window, and I'd known the equipment had delivered upon its promise. I attached the clip, and I saw my body age in unnatural stride. A stole a look of myself in the window, and let a small chuckle escape through a seemingly tenanted throat.

""Of course you would have discovered it,"" Armando said with no mirth in his voice. ""The whole world revolves around you now doesn't it?""

""I mean... it kind of does, doesn't it?"" I smiled slightly, the implications of our findings still unfolding in my brain.

On the other side of the lab Dr. Garcia argued with the rest of our colleagues, occasionally shooting angry glances in my direction. I could see her holding a printout of the data, slapping the page with her index finger and shouting that some variable must have been miscalculated.

""I think I'd better go and get some rest,"" I told Armando.

""I think you'd better go and get somewhere safe,"" Armando replied. ""If news of this gets out you'll become the most important person on the planet.""

""If I understand this correctly, I already *am* the most important person on the planet, whether news of this gets out or not,"" I said.

""No need to get so solipsistic,"" Armando said. ""There could be other humans out there. You're not guaranteed to be the only one.""

""Then we'll find them,"" I said. ""We'll find all of the humans and we'll tell them the truth.""

""I was thinking the same thing,"" Armando said.

We both realized at that moment that the shouting on the other end of the lab had gone quiet.

""Dr. Garcia... please put it down,"" said Louiza. She was staring down the barrel of a pistol that Dr. Garcia was holding.

""It doesn't matter,"" Dr. Garcia said. ""Nothing matters anymore. This whole world, revolving around *her*?"" she said while briefly waving the gun in my direction. ""What a joke. What a terrible cosmic mistake. To think that I don't even matter? Ridiculous.""

""You do matter,"" I said across the room to Dr. Garcia. ""You're just as much a part of this world as I am.""

""I'm just as much a part of this *simulation* as you are,"" she corrected. ""I'm not a part of the living world like you though. In fact, I wonder..."" she said as she started walking toward me.

""Dr. Garcia, don't do anything you'll regret,"" Armando said as he moved in front of her to block her path.

""If I kill her in this simulation, what happens to her brain in real life,"" Dr. Garcia asked.

""Let's not find out,"" Armando said, blocking her view of me. ""We can work on this problem together, like we've always done. As a team.""

Dr. Garcia leveled her gun with Armando's chest.

""We aren't a team, Armando,"" Dr. Garcia said with tears smearing her mascara down her face. ""We are bits of code in a simulation. We don't exist. We... are not."" She closed her finger on the trigger.

""A problem is reported in vat W-4210,"" the engineer said. ""Readouts show high levels of distress and fear of death.""

The screen flashed before our eyes.   
8 years ago, my research team set out to determine the meaning of life. Fielding government grants for a project like this was no easy feat, but we were able to convince the right types of dreamers and motivators to get the money we needed. We spent every day for 8 long years, determining whether or not we were created for a reason. 

But we discovered something far different from what we'd imagined...

""EARTH IS A SIMULATION.""

Catherine, one of the Team Leads, was in stark denial. ""It's impossible... There is no way... 8 years of research and this?! No... NO... IT'S ALL A LIE"" The reality of the situation crushed her very soul, and she has never handled disappointment well. She ran out of the office, berserk with wild emotions. I haven't seen her since.

Tyler broke down into an uncontrollable fit of anguish. I had never heard anyone in my life cry and breathe as heavily as he did. He threw his research off of his desk, creating a fleeting landscape of hastily\-scrawled notes. I only recently learned that when he got home that night, he ended his own life. 

Almost everyone in my laboratory went mad... Some turned to drugs, others to crime, and some others fell off the face of the Earth. As I watched the madness unfold before me, I couldn't help but smile. 

They didn't see it like how I saw it. They believed that this was the end of civilization as we knew it. That nothing we did would matter anymore.

But that was far from the truth I saw.   
If Earth is a simulation, there must be a creator.   
If Earth is a simulation, someone must be watching. 

I left the laboratory with new ambition: To find the creator. To speak with him.  
And to get my revenge.",guzmonster11

The air stank with the smell of sour breath and blood.  The only sound left was the shuffling of feet, a man's whimpering - and a baby.  It wasn't crying, for once.  It just lay in the man's arms, eyes still squeezed tight shut.

""Give it,"" the thug across the room said, leering at the man - the father.  The mother's eyes stared sightlessly up at the ceiling as she lay still.  The thug didn't care.  He'd come here for one thing, and it wasn't her.

The man scowled, drawing away.  ""N-No.  I'm not doing this.""

'We had- a *deal*,"" the thug hissed, slamming his fist into the father's face  even as his colleague snatched the child away.

The father fell to the grimy floorboard with a whining yelp.  In truth, he wasn't putting up much of a fight.  They weren't *wrong*.  He didn't quite know what they wanted with his newborn - he'd really rather not know - but, well, he had a bit of a love affair with gambling, and he had to repay his debts somehow.

He hoped that whatever god there was out there could find a way to forgive him.

The door creaked open.  They froze.

""Am I interrupting?"" a voice said, low and slimy.  A newcomer slipped in, lips pursed.  He smiled at the sight of the baby.  ""Oh, good.  Right on time, then.  I'll just be taking him, and-""

""The fuck you think you're doin'?"" the thug said, spitting at him.

The newcomer blinked.  He was dressed oddly, with a heavy canvas apron over what looked almost like robes.  The thugs took a step back.  A canvas apron stained with *blood*.

The newcomer sighed.  ""I'm just collecting a debt.  Fellow over there needed a bit of a assistive potion of sorts, you might say.  Needed some *help*.  I hooked him up.  And we had a deal.  Didn't we?""  He glanced over at the father with a sidelong grin.

The father turned away, suddenly going pale.

""Well, tough luck,"" the thug spat.  ""He's-""

The door creaked open.  They all froze.

""Is it time?"" a figure said in a low, ominous voice like the rolling of waves.  Tentacles wrapped around the door, sliding from his sleeve.  And from under his hem.  And from his hood.  The others gaped.  ""I am here to collect-""

*The spirits demand recompense.* The eerie whisper brought everyone up short as the ghostly figures drifted through the wall.

They all stood in a tight circle, the mother's body forgotten in the corner.  Arguing.

""Well, I made the first bargain, so-""

""Like hell you did.  Who's goin' to pay back his-""

*Our memory is eternal, and we* ***must-***

The father shrank back, eyeing the door.  They were all distracted.  No one was looking at him.  Pity, about his son, but, well, at times like this a man had to think about number one, didn't he?

Slowly, rising inch by inch, he stood, raising one foot.  Only a few steps, and he'd-

The others stopped abruptly, eyeing him.  Even from across the room, they could smell the raw power coming off him in waves.  This was...well, this was something else entirely.  They knew how this was going to go.

The devil smirked back at them, stuffing his hands down his pockets.  ""Good.  Wonderful.  Now, if you don't mind, I'll be taking him.""  He reached out, pulling the babe out of the thug's arms before he could say or do anything.  The man looked like he was considering fighting back, but thought better of it.

""Perfect,"" Satan breathed, smiling down into the newborn's face.  ""Well, that's all I'm here for, then.  Evening.""  Already, he could feel the ground warming under his feet.  He'd get the child back to the underworld before anyone could notice, and then-

""Where do you think you're going?""

Satan stopped, feeling the ground cool under him.  He sighed.  Perfect.

""None of your business, is it?"" he said, turning with a glare.

Jesus shook his head, sighing.  ""You really think I'd just let you take a child as your own?""

Satan smirked.  ""You've never stopped me before.""

The son of God frowned, feeling his ears turn red.  ""That's- well, you can't have *him*.  He's mine.""

The devil paused.  ""Excuse me?""

Jesus smiled.  ""He's *mine.*""  I had a deal.""  He eyed the hapless Greg.  ""Remember?  You promised?  That if I overlooked your, *ahem*, transgressions, that you'd-""

""Jesus fucking Christ,"" Satan muttered, pressing a hand to his face.  ""Who didn't you make a deal with?""

Jesus scowled.  ""Would you *not*-""

""Look.  You lot!"" Satan roared, spinning on the others.  The whispers had been rising steadily as they milled about, glaring at the two deities with barely-concealed rage.  ""Sorry, but looks like you're all out of luck!  Better luck next time, eh?""

The complaints rose anew, but Jesus turned, staring at them with thin-lipped anger until they fell silent.  They knew they'd lost.  One way or another, they weren't getting their prize.  Not with those two in the mix.

The door creaked open as the first of them filed towards it.  Greg whimpered again, feeling the brush of the cold evening air on his face.

Satan grinned.  ""Actually - you're not *entirely* out of luck, are you?""  He grabbed Greg by the back of his collar, hauling him upright.  ""We've got a bit of trash here.  Mind disposing of it for us?""

Greg paled further, the last bit of color draining from his face.  His hand reached for the hem of Jesus's robes, but the others got there first.

The door slammed shut on his cries as they dragged him out into the alley.

Suddenly alone, the two stared down at the child.

""He's mine,"" Satan insisted, still holding the baby.  ""He's going to be exceptional.  My eyes and hands in the humans' world.""  He grinned, pearly white teeth glinting.  ""Just you wait.""

""There's no way I'm letting you,"" Jesus retorted, folding his arms.  ""He's supposed to be our paragon, a beacon of hope amidst the dark of this horrible little world.""

The two stared at each other, hardly needing words to express their irritation.  They'd been over this before - too many times to count.

The child's cries broke the silence, the baby waking up.  They both looked down, staring into his perfect blue eyes.

""I suppose we could always...share,"" Satan said slowly.

Jesus scoffed.  ""What?  With you?  So I'm supposed to let you fill his mind with lies, and be happy about it?""

Satan grinned.  ""That's your schtick, isn't it?  Offering a *choice*?  The apple, and all that?""

Jesus stopped.  Satan...wasn't *wrong.*

""Come on,"" the devil said, beginning to chuckle.  ""It'll be fun.""

The babe cried harder, his screams echoing throughout the nearly-empty room.

Slowly, Jesus looked up to meet Satan's eyes.  And then he smiled.

Under section B-183 of the demon contract code -- and I mean this in the nicest way possible -- this is absolute and complete bullshit."" I slammed my taloned and clenched fist onto the table. Blood oozing onto the mahogany from the sharp implements that pierced my skin. Yet whatever pain I should have felt turned numb from the rage that boiled within me.

""That child -- was promised to *me*."" The word slithered from my tongue and cinder escape my smoldering throat like fireflies.

""Yes. He was. And he was also promised to twenty four other demons."" Jack Harrington was a snake that put most of my compatriots to shame. I wish I saw that earlier. And though I respected a man -- especially a human -- who could make a demon his bitch. I found the taste of being on the receiving end rather sour.

""The others can go fuck themselves. We had a deal, Jack."" I leaned over his table and brought my face closer to his. Burning gouts of flame for eyes. Torched horns that curved and burnt with the flames of damnation. And my dashing suit to show that I meant business.

Though even as my talons dug into his precious office table and my split tongue slithered like a pythons threat before his face. Jack did not flinch. He removed his spectacles with cold disinterest and met my stare. His eyes carrying wrinkling bags that told of his weathering age nearing forty. But his stare was sharp and void of doubt.

""You'd be nothing without me.""

""And I thank you for that."" Was he repressing a smirk? The small hint of one dancing at the corner of his lip. It didn't matter. I was played as a fool. Took Jack's pleading cries and whimpering lips as the play of a puppy lost and desperate. Throwing a bone to a decrepit mutt who wanted to play with power.

""Easy prey."" I thought. Another desperate fool too blinded by desperation to recognise what they were offering till it was too late. Yet the puppy I saw was just a shadow of Cerberus.

""If that will be all."" Jack returned to his work. Sure that his victory was assured. But he had never met a demon such as myself.

I calmed my rage. My fury tempered into a smoldering fire. A cold thing. My left hand released the table, revealing punctures were my nails had dug. Then my right. I straightened myself to my full height, fixing my tie and clearing my throat. The red of my skin calmed to a darker tone and the flames of my horns dimmed.

Fine. This lawyer wishes to dance with a devil? So be it. I had forgotten the feeling of the game. To be made out to be a fool and have to show all who they were playing with. To make an example twice over. To reward a simple prank with genocide. It had been a long time since someone had been brave enough (or stupid) to try and make me out to be a fool. And though I may have been a little rusty, perhaps another game could be fun.

""Do you know my name?"" I finally asked.

Jack looked up to me. He no longer saw anger in me, nor shock. He saw chilling calmness, and it was the first glint of worry I saw in his eyes all evening as the fireplace cracked and sparks flew.

""You know it, Jack."" I spoke the words with calm seduction. Sardonic tone taunting him.

""Speak it."" A whisper.

""Speak it!"" I slammed my fist onto the table as my horns let loose a burst of fire and my skin turned red.

""Beelzebub."" Said Jack. Still showing no fear, but he spoke the words as if they slipped from his tongue and I could taste his worry. He know the weight of that word. Solomon became my preacher to the world.

""I wish you a pleasant evening, Mr Harrington. And do wish the little guy all the best from me. His uncle Beelzebub will be adopting him soon enough.""

I turned to leave from Jack's massive office. The light within was dim, and the further I moved to the door, past opulent furniture and fine rugs. The more it seemed as if the shadows were swallowing me and my tailored suit. My steps echoing with presence throughout the study.

With a final turn and a smile of filed teeth, I turned to Jack. ""It was good to see you again, Jack."" I spoke the words with mocking sincerity, as I closed the door behind me and began to plot the most miserable way to have Jack's world coming crushing down on him.

I found myself to be in a surprisingly somber mood. It was a chance for a joke. To weave cruel irony and watch Jack dance as my puppet. To take away everything he loved and more.

I whistled. The night was beautiful and I had much to plan.

"[WP] Years ago a human promised you their firstborn as payment - However, as you arrive to collect your debt, you discover you're not the only one they promised their child to.",rxwan-ash66,"The hospital waiting room was nearly empty as Evan sat thinking of excuses not to go through with the visit. Mark and Rebecca were his first close friends to have a baby, which should have filled him with joy, he supposed, but instead it inflicted the crushing realization that he was nearly 30 years old and lacked a serious relationship with anyone or anything.

Evan also wondered if he should be visiting them in the hospital at all. Wasn’t this a little forward? Aren’t hospital visits usually reserved for immediate family? Was this worth it for the sake of a corny 10-year-old joke? Before Evan could make up his mind, however, a nurse opened the door and called his name. He expected her to lead him down a series of winding hallways before reaching the delivery room, giving him time to rehearse what he was going to say (which he didn’t have time to do when he was rehearsing reasons to leave). Instead, she led him to the second door on the right and knocked. Just before she opened the door, Evan could swear he heard a high-pitched voice on the other side that sounded nothing like Mark or Rebecca. The nurse swung the door open and Evan entered.

“Heyyyyy, mom and dad!” Evan said, before dropping his head in mock shame at how the improvised greeting came out. He knew self-deprecating humor would break the ice, especially with two of his best friends, but when he looked up, neither of them were smiling. Rebecca looked as white as the sheets covering her body. 

“Haha, I get it, I get it. Yes, I’m here for your first-born!” Evan said, “You promised me that one night sophomore year, Mark. Remember? We were drunk and arguing over whether or not Sinbad played the genie in Shazaam, and you wagered your first-born child that he did? I’m here to collect, man!”

A staccato throat clearing that sounded like a puppy trying to bark for the first time made Evan whirl around. Standing behind him, rubbing a growing knob on his wrinkled forehead where the doorknob had struck, was a tiny, gross-looking man wearing a tattered brown tunic, green leggings, and what can best be described as elf shoes. 

“The child belongs to me!” he squeaked.

“Uhhh, what the fuck?” Evan said, turning his head slowly back to Mark and Rebecca while trying to keep one eye on the weird little man.

“For her freedom from captivity, to me she promised her first bay-bibity.” the little guy said, struggling to rhyme while pointing a crooked finger at Rebecca. 

“You got me out of timeout five minutes early,” Rebecca said. “When I was six!”

Mark turned to her, “You promised your first child to this imp in exchange for an early release from timeout!?”

“I was six!” Rachel retorted. “You promised your first child to Evan because you were so confident fucking Sinbad was in Shazaam!?”

“Look, guys,” Evan said. “I don’t want your child, I just came to visit and thought I’d open with a joke, you know? But, believe it or not, I think I can help out with this situation.”

Evan stood tall and looked confidently at the little man. “I’ve read my Brothers Grimm, bitch. Your name is…RUMPELSTILTSKIN!”

Everyone in the room froze. For a few moments the only sound that could be heard was the soft electronic beeping of the heart monitor.

“Yeah, no shit,” said Rumpelstiltskin, tapping his elf shoes. “I’ll take the baby, now, please. I’m getting hungry and those things are like baked potatoes–they take at least an hour to cook.”

“Alright, fine, what do you want, then?” Mark asked, catching on. “You’re not eating our baby! Well, I’m going to do everything in my power to hopefully prevent you from eating our baby!” Rebecca shot him a hard look. 

Rumpelstiltskin furrowed his brow so the wrinkles multiplied in waves and the knob bobbed up on a crest like a buoy. He raised a finger to the sky and shouted, “35 million dollars!”

“Motherfucker, you can weave hay into gold!” Mark said, jumping off the end of the bed.

“Right, right, jeez, settle down,” Rumple replied. “Okay, well, shit, then…I dunno, let me name the child.”

The three humans in the room exchanged glances, then both men looked at Rebecca. She shrugged. 

“Better than letting this weird fucko literally consume our child,” she admitted. “Alright, what do you want to name him?” 

Rumpelstiltskin’s beady little eyes gleamed with treachery. He rubbed his diminutive, disgusting hands together and growled, “You shall name him…ALAN.”

He sadly says “you’re the first person in 1,986 years to come to my party. Can I get you anything?”",Azraels_Fear,"I stared at God for what felt like forever. Is this really him? Is God actually real? Why me? So many questions ran through my mind and yet all I could think about was what I could ask God for in response to his question.

""I'll take a Bloody Mary!"" I joked.

God clicked his fingers. A glass of what looked like water appeared on what would be my side of the table. I sat down, somewhat confused and even more intrigued. The liquid fizzed a little, and had a very slight cloudyness to it. I placed the present on the table, but he ignored that it was there.

God nodded for me to try the liquid in the glass. I obliged, picked up the glass and took a small sip. My eyes closed as my sensations heightened. This was no ordinary glass of liquid as I first thought it to be. It was the most flavoursome and extraordinary Bloody Mary-tasting substance I have ever consumed.

""Wow! You've certainly got me fooled, pal. So, how did you do that?"" I laughed, as I necked the rest of the glass in one go.

""I am God. And it's been 1,986 years since I have seen anyone this close in person!"" he insisted.

I done the maths. 2018-1986=32. 32AD.

""But, that means nobody has attended your party since Jesus was crucified?""

That was where things took a turn for the worst.

God laughed, stood up from his chair and seemed to grow taller and taller. He stood 8ft tall, his shadow engulfed both myself and the table.

I dropped the glass on to the table as I attempted to stand up. The small trace of liquid that was gathered at the bottom of the glass slowly crept along and dripped on to the table. I couldn't stand up, though. It was as if I were paralysed. I had no feeling whatsoever, and all I could taste was the Bloody Mary, or what I had hoped had been my favourite drink.

God's laugh grew louder and deeper as he made his way round to my side of the table. He placed his hand on my shoulder. I finally felt something, although I wish I hadn't. His hand on my shoulder felt like a hot iron, melting my clothes to my skin as the smell of burning flesh began to become overwhelming.

I could not see him. My neck failed to turn no matter how hard I tried. I could only move my eyes to look around.

Who is he? What was he doing to me? What did he want? Questions flooded my mind as I sat there, just as animated as the chair I was sitting on.

Seconds went by before he removed his hand from my shoulder. This was not what I was expecting when turning up to this so-called party for God. I thought it would be a joke and that someone with a sense of humour had set up a bash for a laugh. I guess the Bible I had brought as a gift wouldn't be as funny now. It still sat on the table, I started to think he knew what it was already.

I blacked out.

I woke up with my eyes straining to adjust to the light. As my eyes came back to focus, I looked around and could see nothing but white. White walls, white floor, white bed, white furniture. I stood up, struggling to remember exactly what had happened. I slowly creeped towards the door at the other end of the room, unsure what to expect when, or if, I got there. However, I did make it to the door and as I turned the big white shiny handle, the door clicked and creaked open automatically away from me. I let go of the handle so I wasn't dragged with it.

God was there. I wouldn't forget a face like that anywhere. The pure white eyes and the silver hair, unmistakable.

""You have been chosen,"" he said, ""come and join us!""

As I walked towards him nervously, I seen more and more people coming in to view from where the door and frame had previously blocked out the path of vision.

""I have selected you. You are a person with exceptional qualities, and I intend to accommodate you here, free from the prison that is Earth.""

I was speechless. What did he mean?

""Earth was designed to be a beautiful place, full of different races, species, breeds. Where the views alone were enough to make one smile and people and animals would get along harmoniously. But, as you know, greed and power were two of the outstanding factors which contributed to it's downfall. It's an evil place where corporations and the media run the countries. Where people hurt others for pleasure and killing is a sport. Where money is what people are judged on and not the qualities they possess. We are all equal, whether we are God's, lawyers, disabled, or bin men. We are not defined by our jobs, our homes, our cars, our self-cleaning appliances, or our clothes. And that is why I abandoned it long ago, although I return from time-to-time and select a small percentage of inhabitants to enjoy this glorious paradise.""

I was saved, but did God kill me to bring me here?

""Did you kill me? Am I dead?"" I asked, unsure as to what I hoped his answer was to be.

""No!,"" he scoffed, ""You were walking to the party and failed to check the roads properly. In too much of a hurry, I'd say. It was a bus, but it was a sincere accident and the driver has since attempted to take his life. He shall be joining us soon, though.""",DarkHorseStoryTeller

 - I've figured it out! - dr Beins said with a big smile.
They both stood in front each other. Mike Mislou, the older one, was appointed the head of their think tank by an unknown man known only as ""the Master"", and Gerard Beins, the new addition to the team. Young, always excited and very clever. ""Master"" picked him personally.
 - Well, don't be shy - dr Mislou encouraged his colleague. - Show me what you've come up with.
Dr Beins pointed to the desk. Giant spreadsheets with tables of data covered the metal surface. Both scientists approached it and leaned over, their titles, as always, stayed vertical to the ground.
 - We have assumed that titles are referring to the person's future, that it's some kind of prophecy, but what if they're not what will happen, but rather what could, or even should? - young dr Gerard was speaking quickly, his voice trembling with excitement. He pointed out different table cells and kept explaining. - We have final reports from small cities, investigations were faster there, less people, everybody knows each other. Since the titles appeared few months ago, there were hundreds reported deaths. Mr master's crew found out that only in around 32% of the cases titles actually matched events in person's life. Most of them did not match at all. Meaning that titles are not truthfully describing reality.

 - I asked my psychologist friend a few questions last night. She said that her patients often are afraid on how well the titles reflect on their personal needs or desires. That's my hypothesis: those titles are a reflection on person's soul, their core, they determine not who you are or will be, but rather what you want, or should be. It's... - he stopped suddenly and looked above the head of his boss. Bright, shiny letters ""Mike the idiot"" stared at him, as if accusing him of being exactly what they say. His own title, ""Gerard the discoverer"", answered with it's own light, challenging, doubting even?
 - Maybe - dr Beins gulped. - Maybe I should be certain.
 - Good idea - said dr Mislou, the cold in his voice cutting through skin.

You're starting to think he's actually GIVING you time to live, instead of making predictions.",ScienceCorgi,"I make sure to appear especially sick and crippled as I stroll into the medical center to visit Dr. Green. As I fill out my information, I cannot help but think back to my initial diagnosis, when I was actually sick and crippled.

Dr. Green broke it to me easily, nurses respectfully standing at his side with their heads down. ""Son, I hate to tell you this, but it appears you only have so much time left on this Earth."" The doctor gave me six months. Then, a year. However, a years worth of time passed several months ago and whenever it became apparent that I wasn't dead, Dr. Green demanded that I come in for another check-up. 

I recall after he first diagnosed me, I could feel an odd wave of resurgence flow through my body. I felt like my old self again the second I stepped into my car. I spent no days suffering through unending days of meditation, pondering over if it was some act of God. I instantly knew that it was Dr. Green. I don't think he knows it, but he has an ability, and maybe it is a gift from God, but it doesn't matter. What does matter is that I get an extended death date. 

I sit on the medical bed, staring at the ceiling. I can feel weakness beginning to crawl into my veins. This has happened before, back when I was approaching six months. I preceded to schedule another appointment with the Doctor, and the same events occurred as the first time. It did nothing but reaffirm that my theory is correct. 

I'm brought out of my trance whenever I hear the door squeak. Dr. Green walked in with a smile on his face and and slightly wide eyes. There weren't many grey hairs left on his head, and similar to the act that I was portraying, he wobbled with each step. It's honestly pretty adorable. 

""You're a real specimen, you know that, son?"" I smiled, ""I guess so. I'm a real fighter, huh?""

We performed some of the basic test, measuring my body, X-raying my chest, etc. I was confident that since my death is actually approaching, Dr. Green would change the date to a further time. If it was anything like before, he would walk into the room with a glum look on his face. To my surprise, Dr. Green actually came in with a smile.

""Son, turn that frown upside down, 'cause I have amazing news!"" You're all clear,"" Dr. Green exclaimed. No. This is not going to happen. ""Wait, doc, you can't be serious. I can feel it, I'm weak and I know as a fact that I'll die, doc, you can't do this to me."" 

The Doctor gave me a sensationalized look, ""What are you talking about, son?"" I stuttered a bit then said, ""Dr. Green, I *need* you to expand my date. Do what you've been doing, for the love of God, surely, you have to know what I mean when I tell you this!"" I was standing now and Dr. Green almost seemed frightened. I didn't even realize I had backed him into a corner, it didn't matter, though; This is a matter of life and death. 

""Come on, come on, just please, do this one thing for me. Just lie, if my body does appear healthy, that'll change."" 

Now, it becomes clear to me that Dr. Green doesn't know about his ability. This is dreadfully bad for me. Dr. Green begins to slam his fist against the wall and scream, or at least as loud as someone his age can scream. 

I don't want him to feel threatened, so I get down on my knee and beg. ""Doctor Green, you need to understand that I don't want to die. All you have to do is use your ability and heal me, for God's sake, I can feel it creeping up on me now."" I plead with the Doctor and he just won't stop screaming, no matter what I do. 

The door swings open, and I look to see a burly security guard rushing at me. My knees collapse as I'm tackled into a wall, my vision beginning to fade away. The last thing that I see is a terrified, magical, evil doctor trembling as a nurse pats him on the back and says something that I can't hear while glaring at me with equal distaste as the guard. 

I don't know if I'll be alive if I awake. I could be in heaven or hell or maybe there won't be anything to wake up to. However, in my final moments, my mind is filled with one thought and one thought alone.

If I survive this, I'm going to find that satanist doctor, and I'm going to make him pay for killing me.

You're starting to think he's actually GIVING you time to live, instead of making predictions.",ScienceCorgi,"""Still alive, huh?"" That had become my wife's and my little joke. I shook my head  and smiled at her face poking in the kitchen doorway as I finished making coffee. ""Yeah, sorry,"" I replied, ""I know my coffee sucks."" ""Well, maybe your miracle doctor could fix that next,"" she grinned, slipping on her shoes to head off to work. ""Yeah..."" I said slowly. ""Oh, come on,"" she said, pausing before turning to walk out the front door, ""You're not still on that, are you?"" 

""Me?"" I said, forcing a laugh, ""Nah, being alive when I thought I'd be dead is enough to think about. You know, a career, destiny, finding a fulfilling purpose, what I want for dinner later kinda stuff."" ""Okay..."" she said, studying my face and clearly not convinced. ""Babe,"" I said, ""I was face to the floor drunk when I told you that. I don't think the doctor is adding years to my life by some magical means, okay?"" ""Uhhuh,"" she said, grabbing the thermos of coffee I was handing her. She took a sip and grimaced. ""Yeah, yeah,"" I said, shooing her out.

Two hours later I was at the Doc's office. No, I hadn't told my wife about the appointment. No, I had no real reason to be here, because I wasn't damn sick or anything. Two years I should have been dead, yet two years I'd been a shining example of health. You might be thinking, why in the hell are you annoyed by this, like -sorry you survived a terminal illness against all odds and now get to live out your life? But it's stranger than that. My illness...was so rare, with no treatments known. My death sentence was real. And my doctor didn't mince words when he told me all of this two years ago. And yet, here I still am. And forgive me, but, I've been a little perturbed by it. And since he's the only doc I saw in that whole time, he's the one whose door I'm going to beat down for some answers.

Okay, I'm not beating down doors; his receptionist is sassy and abrasive as hell and would probably body check me if I tried. In fact, everytime I catch her eye from across the room when I'm nervously looking towards her crown of orange red frizz, I actually duck my head. So there I remained, sitting at the far corner seat of the empty waiting room. I was tapping my foot, not really seeing the yellowing pages of the open-faced magazine lying in my lap. I was too preoccupied with imagining my heroically sliding that pane of glass above her desk wide open and giving her a good yell, and damn it, she listened this time. Daydreams, amiright?

""Phil Jones?""

The raspy, deep voice of the charming receptionist came at me like a slap. I looked up from my musings and came to, seeing this hefty woman looking at me with all the distaste of a retired neighbor whose only love is her front lawn and her one scraggly pet. I looked around the room at all the people who weren't here, wondering why she had to announce my name 1) as loudly as she did, and 2) in the form of a question. But, all I did was sigh and stand up, ""Yeah, that'd be me."" She rolled her eyes and handed me my charts, ""Room 2.""

I walked down the narrow and small hallway that was tiled in a matte and dinged yellow, turning when I got to my assigned room. I opened the door, and was hit by the smell of sterility. I sat down on the exam table and waited, reminiscing one of my favorite Tom Segura bits as my feet swung awkwardly in the air like I was still five years old.

The door opened, ""Well, well, Phil!"" I looked up at my doctor, a gray haired and lean man with a slightly hollowed out face that still had the light pinkness of life in his cheeks. Closing the door, he pulled out his reading glasses and put them on, opening my charts to - refresh his memory, I guess. He was nodding now, anyway. ""Still alive, huh?"" I smiled thinly, ""Yeah, that's my wife's line."" He began to take my vitals - blood pressure, heartbeat, the like - all while chatting to me about his baseball team's abysmal season. Finally he stopped, pulled away, and asked me the question I'd been so nervous to ask, ""Well, Phil, you're in great shape. What's brought you here today?"" 

I hesitated, then said, ""Well. THAT."" He looked confused. So I went on, ""That I'm in great shape. I mean damn it, look at these arms,"" I slapped them for effect, ""I have normal shits. My blood work is perfect. My skin is no longer peeling off. My hair grew back. And yet, two years ago I sat in this very office and you told me I was going to die within months. And yet again, here I am, two years later, in this same office, the damn picture of health."" I took a breath before diving into the heart of it, ""Now, maybe an unexpected second shot at life makes people think weird shit, I don't know; this is my first go of it. But point is, I've been thinking some things. And I've just gotten it in my head that you - well...are you doing this? Are you giving me time or something?""

The doctor looked at me, slightly amused, but his brow contained just an iota of lifted concern. He sighed, ""Phil, I..."" He looked at me, ""When did you start thinking this?"" I frowned, ""I don't know...maybe when I didn't die, but kept getting better instead? You're the only doctor I've seen, and the only treatments you gave me were to ease symptoms and pain until I was gone, not to cure it, because what I had was incurable. So? What else was I supposed to think?"" The doctor shrugged, ""Perhaps that there are still miracles."" I stared at him. ""Okay, okay,"" he said, lifting his hands in surrender and placing my charts to the side.

He sighed. He pulled up the chair against the wall, ""Not everyone knows about this place."" He paused, seeing my thoroughly non-entertained expression, ""That is to say, not everyone can see it."" I rolled my eyes, ""Doc, if you're about to lay some Harry Potter muggle bullshit on me, I'm going to lose it."" He shook his head, smiling slightly, ""No, no wizards here I'm afraid."" I looked at him curiously, almost suspiciously, ""Not even you?"" ""A wizard? No, not a wizard,"" he said, then hesitated. I jumped, ""What is it then, what is this?"" 

He looked at me, considering, then began, ""I took over this practice about 30 years ago now. From a Dr. Stoll - don't know if you know -"" his voice stopped when he saw my face, ""Okay, that's fair. Anyway, he was a respected doctor in a small community, even though he had only set up shop there for about five years. I had found it odd, because a man of his age normally has his space for twenty, thirty, at least. And I, young and ready for a private practice, heard he was getting ready to retire. Seeing that I could make this place my own, I hustled over and talked to him."" 

""He looked at me - a big round face stuffed into spectacles, hunkering over his desk like a calm eagle - and said, 'You don't want this office.' Oh, how I argued with him, pleaded my case, showed countless resume bullet points and other nonsense I was sure would convince him. He kept shaking his head, repeating, 'No.' So I left. But I came back the next day, the next, the next. Finally, I pushed him to a point. He slammed down on his desk and said, 'Why?' And I told him nothing like what I had told him before. About healing, how much healing made me feel full. To save a life, no matter how small it may seem, was what I was born on this earth to do. I stated my case, I bared my soul. I was humbled. And this time, he listened. And then he said - come back tomorrow. 'But-' I said, and he silenced me in one look, 'Come back tomorrow.'""

""I was there before anyone else was, waiting outside the locked door with a coffee and shivering slightly in the coolness of an autumn morning. He arrived as if out of a mist, tall and big bellied with his shoes clacking on the stone of the street - or perhaps I was seeing things, I don't know. Anyway, for the next year I worked here with him, an apprentice, if you will -""

""Apprentice?"" I asked, baffled, ""But you were already a doctor.""

""Yes,"" he said, smiling sadly, ""But these walls....this place..."" he paused. ""This place is no ordinary building, and I had to learn its ways."" I stared at him, ""What, the wiring?"" ""Sure,"" he said, grinning faintly, ""Something like that. You see, what I learned in those years was that this building is never in the same place - it only appears to those who need to see it. In fact, one could argue this place doesn't even exist at all. Only proof is thousands of saved lives, really, and once they are cured and have no more questions, we vanish forever in their eyes."" 

""What?"" I said, ready to pinch myself. ""But what if a person is sick for years?""

""Then we would still be there, in their eyes, but,"" he chuckled, ""People don't stay sick that long here."" I stared at him. He went on, ""I don't know exactly how long this place has existed, in fact, Dr. Stoll didn't know either; he inherited from someone, and so on like that all the way back to its birth. Perhaps it existed even before us, before human life. But someone was able to channel it, box it in, and become a place where the most needing, deathly ill people can be cured.""

I was still staring at him, ""I don't know what's going on anymore. What day is it?"" He smiled, ""Well, if you still need us, come back tomorrow.""

I went home in a daze, staggered off to bed early, mind flush with all the words Doc had filled it with. I woke up the next morning, early, waiting around anxiously in the cold kitchen until I could slam out the door and race over to his office. ""No way,"" I was thinking the whole time, ""No way."" I hummed along the streets and turned the corner onto his street. I slowed slightly, not sure what I was about to see, or perhaps, never see again. And there, my brakes squeaked to a halt.

The building was gone.",Littlewing615

Even with lead poisoning, I enlisted for a reason. I still fought, all the way through France. 

Then, there was a grenade I didn't hear hit the floor. Took Doc two hours to fix the leg up. At least he had a secret stash of morphine he used for situations like this. Afterwards, he told me I would have to spend the next two weeks in the infirmary. After those two weeks, I had about a year. 

So I spent the next year fighting in Germany, until the day came: Hitler was dead. By his own hand. We cheered. So many years of war, and finally it was over. But after that grenade, I had become more alert. So when I saw a disgruntled young man scowling at my commanding officer, I payed attention. And when I saw him pull out a gun, I sprang into action. 

I ran in front of him. He was aiming for the officers head. Instead, he hit mine.

I talk about this like it's nothing more than getting a headache, but I guess 73 years of telling this story will do that to you. 

Anyway, where was I? Oh, yes. He shot me in the head. I hit the ground. Surprisingly, hitting the ground hurt worse than the bullet. Gues that was a bad sign. My vision darkened and the pain faded...

Then it all came back into focus. I jumped to my feet. Everything was just a murmur. A bunch of people were running and panicking. Three guys were holding the shooter down. I looked around. No one was looking at me. They were all pointing and shouting at my feet. I looked down. 

Oh. That's why.

My dead body was laying on the ground, brains blown out. How lovely. 

I looked around, and found someone staring at me. Doc. He walked over to me. I though he was just like everyone else, unaware and muffled, until he walked straight though someone like a ghost. He came up to me and said, “Sorry, Dan. Boss won't let me do you any more favors. It's time.” I was astonished. What did he mean? Where was I? And as if he heard me, he said, “Welcome to Limbo. It's where people go before they're reaped. Usually, by me.” He waved his hand over his face and and his slender, dirty face was replaced by a skeleton's skull. “I am Orpheus Grimm. I am the Grimm Reaper. And now, we leave.” He grabbed my hand, and we departed from the land of the living.",Intelleblue

""You have 6 months to live. Please live out the rest of your life as you see fit.""

It was just a physical that I came in for. At age of 40, at a point where some would consider a prime time of our lives--I have instead received a death sentence from an unlikely place. Malignant tumor, too close to the heart to operate. It was like going through a car inspection and you found out that someone planted a time bomb that you couldn't defuse. And time was running out.

""Is there truly nothing you could do, doctor?"" I asked.

""Absolutely nothing. You could always get a second opinion from others, but they would tell you the same,"" the doctor said.
And indeed, he was right.

------

The night after I realized all of the doctors I reached out refused to help me, I stayed up until 3 AM, with a notebook in front of me sitting on the desk. I have written out the things that I could not do, people I have wronged, regrets and mistakes I felt that I could yet undo. My memory was not what it once was, so a lot of the things could have fallen through the cracks. Nonetheless--I began.

I decided to, to begin, call up my parents that I have not spoken for better part of the decade.

------

It has been a year since my doctor's visit. With the heavy heart--perhaps that is literal in this case?--I tried to bring closure to everything before the life forced the closure on me. Perhaps you have seen those shows or read books that was all about seeking vindication, or making up for the past mistakes. Well, that was me. 

After a year, was there more to be done by me? I was not sure. The first six months were a blur, a race against time to reach out to everyone that I could. As one would expect, reactions were wildly varied. One one spectrum:

""I told you to never call us again,"" grumbled father.

And on the other:

""I am glad you've called me, although the circumstances could be better for both of us,"" said one of my old flames on the phone.

Most of them went, however, something along the lines of this:

""You've never reached out; we thought you were dead already.""

Perhaps I was too focused on myself that I never cared for anyone else.

------

""And how do you feel?"" said the doctor.

I shrugged. ""As good as I could be, doctor.""

""That's good,"" doctor said as he scribbled down some notes on his notepad. ""How did the whole closure thing work out for you?""

I froze. ""I don't think I've told you about that before.""

He laughed. ""That's what people do when they were met with a certain doom.""

""You've got a dark humor, doctor. 'Certain doom?'""

""I'm just sick of the word 'death,' really. The job makes me use it too much.""

And after a checkup, he said: ""Congratulations, I think that, somehow, the tumor's getting smaller, but it's still there. I say you have a year to live.""

""Huh...""

""Do you have any concerns?""

""I have been wondering, doctor: is this right? How do you even know how long I would live?""

""Just educated guess. And karma. Uh.""

I raised an eyebrow. ""Karma?""

""Never mind that I said that. Just keep up with whatever you've been doing,"" Doctor smiled. ""You've been doing great. Hopefully I'll see you next year as well, if everything works out.""

Somehow--it feels like I've been granted more time to keep righting things, not just to live in despair and wait for the end to come. ""Thanks, doctor,"" I said as I shook his hand. It felt warm. He smiled at me--a smile of, perhaps, an enlightened?

""I'm afraid it isn't the news that we hoped for. There are still signs of the cancer.""

He forces a smile, always putting on a brave face. ""What does this mean doc? More chemo?""

""I'm afraid that's not an option, you're already too weak. We'd be putting you at greater risk for a nominal chance of success.""

""Ok, so now what?""

""Now it is just a question of time.""

There's that look. The one I see every day. The realization that all hope is lost. I wish I could tell him it will all be ok, but I can't. Instead it will require a miracle. I don't get to take credit. That's not how this works. 

""How long do I have doc?""

I reach out and touch his hand. ""Right now, let's say six months. Come and see me again in three months and we will see where you're at. I might be able to give you more time then, depending on your condition.""

He just nods. No screaming, no blaming, just acceptance. I wish I could give him more time, but there are rules to follow. I need to see how he copes. Some people go the other way with only months to live, drugs, crime, debt. I have a good feeling though. Survival needs a positive attitude. If he's still like this in three months then I can give him more time. He certainly deserves it.

He gets up to leave and holds out his hand. ""Thanks doc. For everything.""

I hold back the tears as I shake it, his grip already feeling a little stronger. 

As soon as he leaves I slump into my chair. I'm so drained right now. It has been a long day. I need a boost, something to get me back on my feet. I check my schedule for tomorrow. It is full. So many people to help. If only I had more time. 

I get in my car and drive to my next appointment. I stand at the large foreboding gates while they buzz me in. The guard nods, ""Hey doc. Back again so soon?""

""What can I say Jenkins, I can't get enough of this place.""

They lead me through to the infirmary and wait outside the door. The prisoner is already there, chained to the bed. He snarls at me. ""Are you the guy? The other prisoners have told me you can give me something to make all this go away. To end my life quietly.""

""I don't know what you mean. It would be illegal for me to give you something to end your life. You are serving time, there is no easy way out.""

He grabs me and I smile. They always grab me. Makes it so much easier. I can feel the time flowing, topping up my reserves. He senses it too and he lets go, startled. Then he sees my smile and he understands. He holds out his hand and I take it, draining what is left. He says, ""How long?""

""I'll leave a couple of months. It can't be too soon, or they will suspect something.""

He just nods, all fight gone now. He says, ""What will you do with it?""

""I'll give it to someone that needs it.""

He smiles softly, finally at peace. ""Take as much as you can. I'll get into a fight tomorrow, make sure it's my last. Don't waste two months.""

I nod. ""Thank you for your donation.""",VerbalCA

""He looked pretty bad.""

Sunken eyes accented a greying tone to his face and hands. He had rich black hair when we first started treatments. It was a thinned mop of grey today. His springing step had slumped into a soft shuffle.

My voice broke a little, my girlfriend driving silently next to me. 

""H-He said I had about 20 years of remission I could expect. He asked about you, and about the dog.""

Tears rolled down my cheeks at this point. He had looked so tired. Like he had given his last.

""Then he sat down in the chair next to the examination table, and said he was going to rest his eyes. He didn't take another breath.

He died.""

We shared a look at a stop light. We didn't know how he had done it, but we were going to cherish this gift.

She'd seen how folks turned into animals. Cancer rocked your system and withered you away like a grape in the sun. It completely disfigured her husband Phil. That barrell chest of his had just...deflated, and soon enough she was picking out an urn, looking up flights back to the Keys to spread her love's ashes into the waves of green ocean. In the end, he'd been a wax-paper imitation of himself. He couldn't even speak. But she'd been living with the same diagnosis for seven years now, and she still went to play shuffleboard every Wednesday. 

Doctor Meehan kept repeating the same thing during every routine check-in. He was a stocky man who sorta reminded her of Phil, except his eyes were a shade of green she'd never quite seen. ""You're a real fighter,"" he'd say without fail. ""I could see you with another whole year.""

Each time those eyes of his would shine with unnatural splendor, and he'd place a hand on her shoulder. 

And each time, Janice gave him what she supposed he wanted: a halfhearted smile and a ""that's good to hear."" She'd walk shakily home to sit in her rocker and rest her hip. Her soaps would be on, and she'd turn the volume on her television way up so she could think amidst all that white noise. Her fingers would hardly cooperate. Her legs would be screaming. She'd feel the cancer crawling through her like some invisible worm. And she'd think: *Another whole year*.

There was just no possible way. 

The joys of her life had sprung a leak. She used to go running in the mornings and watch the dew sparkles fade. She used to drink glasses of Cabernet until her cheeks flushed red. Instead, what she got was another whole year of screaming into her pillow, of gritting through tasteless food. Another whole year of being propped up as a medical marvel among her friends, of bearing those awkward conversations that never *quite* mention the word 'death'. 

She'd have to last through another year of fading memories. 

Already, it seemed, she'd forgotten Phil's laugh. She thought perhaps it was nasally, birthed from his upper breath, but murkiness laced her with doubt, and she wondered if, maybe, it had been sorta deep? She remembered Phil's barrell chest sort of heaving, his face covered in dimples. Had his laugh filled the room? She pinched her nose in an effort to remember, cursing her memory for tearing her to pieces. 

The next time she saw Meehan, she stopped him before his diagnosis. ""Why are you saving me doc?"" she asked. 

Meehan cocked his head to his side. His glasses slid down the ridge of his nose as he frowned. ""What do you mean, dear?"" 

Janice flashed a meager smile. ""You ain't as slick as you think you are.""

""Janice, my *job* is to save you. Are you feeling all right?""

Janice swatted his hand away. ""I'm feeling just fine,"" she said. ""I'm practically a walking tumor.""

She let Meehan stumble around for a bit, mumbling something about fetching a nurse, until she finally sighed and let it all hang out there. 

""I know you been giving me more *time*.""

Meehan stopped in his tracks. 

His face turned a shade lighter. 

""You..."" He sighed. ""How'd you figure me out?""

""I've been terminal for seven years,"" Janice said. ""But you ain't asked once if you could poke and prod me for study.""

Meehan smiled. ""I'll have to work on that for the others, thank you.""

Janice remained perfectly still. Her chest felt as if it were boiling over. 

Meehan rubbed the back of his neck. 

""This is...unusu--""

""You don't have the right,"" Janice interrupted. She stood upon shaky legs and pointed an accusing finger his direction. ""You don't get to choose when people go, without...without even *asking.*"" She stood up straight and gulped. ""You have *no* idea what it's like to have accepted something but to be kept *waiting*.""

""I just wanted to help,"" he stammered. ""It's my job.""

""You want to help? Then *help*.""

Meehan shuffled on his feet. ""What do you want me to do?""

Janice swallowed. Her throat was hoarse. 

""I want to hear my husband's laughter again.""

It took a few moments for Meehan to catch her meaning. 

When he did his adam's apple bobbed. 

""Make it all end in the next few minutes,"" Janice whispered. Tears were streaming down her cheeks now. ""Make it all stop."" 

Doctor Meehan's eyes shone green and brilliant one final time as he nodded and placed his hand on her shoulder. 

This time they were wet with tears.

I wish that underutilized concepts could be taken and ""re-used"" in new films that have nothing to do with the original.  

Kinda like what happened with ""The Purge"" sequels.  The first one kinda wasted the idea, so the follow-ups took better advantage of it, but still ended up being lackluster because they had to exist in the same world.  Had that idea gotten a total do over with high end writing, it could have been great.

TL;DR-  I believe that recreating movies based on great concepts, where the original doesn't live up to its potential should be ""a thing"".  It will never happen due to expensive rights issues, but I'm sure everyone can cite examples of wasted movie concepts.",KrombopulosDelphiki

You're starting to think he's actually GIVING you time to live, instead of making predictions.",ScienceCorgi,"""It's been a year and look at me. I feel just fine. like... like I was never sick or something. What is going on?"" I asked with a little bit of accusing tone. 

It was exactly one and a half year ago when I collapsed on the ground with a sharp pain in my chest. I thought it was a heart attack and my life was going to end right then. We all thought so. 

But I lived. An angel like nurse was the first person I saw when I woke up and the doctor told me I have a heart condition, something about irregular heartbeat, weak pulse and so on. To be honest, everything just went sort of blur after hearing that I had six more months of time here. 

'My family' 

That was the first thought that came to my mind. Six more months. That means I won't be able to take my son fishing like I promised him. That means I won't be able to attend my daughter's piano recital.  That means my wife will probably have to cancel the reservation for anniversary. Only God knows the pain of leaving family behind. Maybe it would had been better if everything ended right there then waiting this death with them. A game that I can never win. 

I decided not to tell my family. Not yet at least. I didn't want to break down crying in front of them. I don't want them to remember me as someone in sorrow and pain.

I never got brave enough to tell them...

Fortunately death didn't come for me after six months. In fact, I have been told my condition has improved slightly and I can expect my heart to last one more year. I've been visiting my doctor every months and every time, he asks me rather unusual questions such as ""Where did you go fishing? caught anything good?""  ""Are you excited about your daughter's piano recital? what song is she going to play?"" ""Where did you make reservation for your anniversary? How was the food there?"" I mean, I have never been told I was going to die before so I just assume he is preparing me mentally for my inevitable death. 

However, I am not going to put up with this anymore. Every time I visit, he just asks me about my daily life and no check\-up or treatment. Not even a pill for god's sake! It was as if we are two buddies just catching up. No. Today I am going to find out what is happening to my body. 

""Every time I visit, you just ask me few questions and that's it. I need to know the progress doc. I mean, am I getting better or are you gonna make another prediction here?"" 

He took his eyes off from my chart and looked at me. I never noticed he has such a blue eyes. 

""Well, we can measure your pulse again if you want but at this stage, there really isn't much we can do you know"" 

""No, don't give me that again. You have used all doctor cliche. 'this pill is working exceptionally well for you!' 'Glad to hear you are exercising, I'm sure that played a role' 'well, we doctors don't know everything you know. we are just humans under white gowns.' You have officially used all of them so, please, just tell me what is going on with my body"" I asked eagerly. 

""Alright John, just one last question for you then. How are you doing?"" he asked sincerely. 

""I... I am great doc. When you first told me I had six months to live, I honestly thought maybe it would be better to end things then. I think I was too devastated by things I didn't and couldn't do. But after six months, I was given another year and I realized it wasn't too late to do them now. I spent glorious time with my family, finally finished my painting, apologized to my sister and you know, general appreciation for everything. I still haven't told my family but I think it's better this way. If I told them, I would had been forced to spend all those time attached to machine or something""

""I'm really happy to hear that John."" He said with a warm smile.

""So, tell me doc. How is my heart holding on?"" 

""Would you say... that you have no regret now...?"" He ignored my question completely. I thought about it for few seconds and answered.

""No. No regrets. Not anymore""

""Alright John. Let me tell you what really happened then"" If this was movie, a sudden suspenseful background music must have started right about now.

""What? what is it doc?"" I leaned in. I didn't even intend to do that.

""Your heart... it stopped 18 months ago"" 

""Yea... it's called heart attack..?"" I said sarcastically.

""No, not a heart attack. A death. You died there John."" He ignored my tone and continued.

""And you brought it back remember?""

""I did. But I am not a doctor.""

I paused. 

Wouldn't you?

""What? Did you just say you are not a doctor? What's going on here?""

""I brought you back to life so you would... let's say 'do more stuff' here""
I didn't know what to say. Well, actually, I did know what I wanted to say but I couldn't. Is my D.O.C trying to tell me that he is actually G.O.D? 

""When you came back after six months, you told me there were still few things you were looking forward to. I wasn't supposed to but I gave you one more year. A time that I thought was enough for you to have no regret. And I was... very happy to see you were doing just that""'

I wanted to call his bluff but something happened. We were not sitting in his office anymore. In a blink of an eye, I was sitting in a white room. And my doctor, he was not a doctor anymore. He is... indescribable...

Then something else happened. Rather than tell me, he showed me. All my memory of last 18 months rushed back to me in a nanosecond. Suddenly, I remembered and felt everything all at once. And a familiar warm voice came to me.

""Are you ready John?""

I nodded. ",seongjun1109

He shifted in the chair and leaned forward, his attention turned to his patient. ""How are you feeling?"" 

She shrugged one shoulder and swallowed before talking. It seemed the entire movement caused her pain. She winced slightly with her eyes closed. ""Honestly? Like I could go any minute.""  Her voice was weak and distant, almost like it had come from another room. He nodded his head slowly and set the clipboard on his lap.   
""The results aren't what we hoped, but I think six months is about what to expect.""  He gave her an encouraging smile.  ""Maybe you can travel some, and see the world? I remember you mentioned going to Portugal with your grandparents."" She turned her eyes toward the window and wiped a tear away. Six months?

She sighed, ""yeah we got some really beautiful pictures.""  He stood and helped her to her feet. He walked her to the door and down the hall into the waiting room, where her parents were waiting for her. 

""Come and visit when you are done adventuring."" He said with a supportive pat to her shoulder. She nodded a little and left with her parents. 

\-\-

""How are you feeling today?"" Her mom had just walked in, she had a plate of breakfast in one hand and a glass of orange juice in another.

""Surprisingly.....very good."" She sat up confidently and put her feet over the side of the bed. "" Can we go on a hike today?"" She asked. She had energy behind her eyes and the bags that had constantly resided beneath her eyes were all but gone. She smiled widely to her mother.  Her mother returned the smile. These good days had become steadily more frequent than her low energy painful days, since the last doctor appointment.

""Of course we can, where do you want to go?""

\-\-

""Its been nearly six months, hasn't it?"" Her dad was holding his daughter with an arm across her shoulders. They were looking over a cliff on the coast. The sun was beginning to set over the horizon. The oranges and pinks of the sky were deepening and the way it was reflected on the waves was magical. She ran a thin and shaky hand through her hair.

""Yeah."" Mortality is a strange concept, she was able to accomplish in the last six months far surpassed anything she had done before. She did go on adventures. She learned how to ski, how to weld, she took dance classes, and she ate all sorts of exotic food. Her family went on a few cruises and camping trips around the world. Currently they were visiting the ancestral home of her father, in Ireland.  There were days left in the six months window her doctor gave her. She felt like it as well, like her clock was winding down again. She felt death approaching. 

""We'll give him a visit when we get back, yeah?"" He always tried to stay positive, even through the bad days. He had had to carry her most of the way to the cost because her strength left her, but she needed this.

She nodded, ""yeah.""

\-\-

""It's good to see you,"" the doctor said warmly as his patient settled into her seat. She had a tan but her face was gaunt like her last visit. She smiled faintly.

""And you, I wish you could have seen me last month."" She had already lost the healthy weight she had gained. Her scapula protruded sharply from her collar. She twisted a Claddagh her father got her from Ireland. 

""I saw the pictures! You had wonderful adventures! What was the best thing you did?"" He smiled warmly and again she echoed it. ""Can you tell me how you feel?"" She shifted in her seat and looked at her hands.

""Like my time is up."" She couldn't even get herself dressed in the morning. All her strength was gone, replaced by a constant ache. Each breath was a needle against her ribs, each step refracted pain up her spin into her neck. She couldn't sleep. She had no appetite.

""Well, I am sorry to hear that."" He drummed his pen on the clipboard.  ""I'll tell you what,"" he started writing something on a notepad. He tore off the page and handed it to her. ""This is good for a year, ok? Keep exploring, keep growing. Spread some love to those that need it, perhaps?"" He smiled, a genuine deep and encouraging smile.  

She took the paper and looked at it. There was a date on it, exactly one year from now. It didn't say anything else. ""I'm confused.""

""Think nothing of it, my dear. Give my best to your family."" He helped her to her feet again and walked her towards the door. 

 Strangely, once they were in the hallway she didn't need his help to walk anymore. She clenched that little piece of paper in her hand. ""I will."" she smiled to her doctor as she walked passed him into the waiting room.

He watched her leave with a smile and faint little shadows growing underneath his eyes.",halfpeeledbanana

""Looking after you, yes. I always have and I always will."" 

""But... That means... I should have died a year ago..."" Slowly, things start to add up, little details that I'd taken for granted, failed to pick up on.

""I couldn't let that happen, you mean too much to me, you know that."" He runs a hand through his thinning hair and another clump comes out between his fingers. I feel my eyes start to burn, feel my throat closing up.

Doctors are not in sort supply, but healers... true healers, with the gift... they are few and far between. They have the ability to take an illness, any illness, away from someone who is suffering and into their own body. The gift makes them a lot stronger and more capable of fighting and beating most sicknesses. But there are some sicknesses that even their powers cannot face.

Nineteen months ago, I was diagnosed with one of these sicknesses and given six months to live. 
After three months, I fell into a coma, but I awoke again before the end of the sixth month. My Doctor told me I would have a year if I allowed myself to be put into a medically induced coma, three days each month.

Obviously, I agreed to it. When you feel the limits of life closing in, you will do everything in your power to grab any extra minutes you can. But if I'd have know the price, if I'd have know the medication was only to keep me in the dark... I never would have agreed.

He reaches out across the table, taking my shaking hand in both of his. They are so bony, when they used to be so strong, how did I not see? The first tear leaks from my eye.

Her legs were a blur as she turned into a garden and leaped effortlessly over fences in order to evade her hunters. Even the helicopter filming the chase struggled to keep up. She emerged on another street as two more cars attempted to block her, yet she slid over the bonnet, almost tipping the car over with her speed. She dashed down an alley, turned left into a main road, weaved seamlessly among the traffic and over the fence into a park, spinning a roundabout as she ran by. The bar was filled with whoops and cheers from the patrons as they watched her escape broadcast from the small television hanging from the wall. Despite her being one of their own, a magic user, the atmosphere felt like punters watching the horse races, hoping their lucky pick comes out on top. It looked like she was going to make it, down another street, and another, the sirens were getting farther and farther, twisting once more past sleepy houses, almost lost them, down an alley, a dead end. Disaster. Groans and disdain sounded all around. The sirens were closer and closer, the blue and red lights reflecting off puddles. She looked around frantically for any form of escape. Now that she had slowed down the camera zoomed in on her. Her trousers had torn and become shorts from the momentum, showing a bright, white glow on both of her calves that gradually dimmed as she reduced her speed. The dark of night highlighted the tattooed writing even more, 'Celeri', the word for Swift. The police were closing in, fully armoured, rifles raised. The light had extinguished to black ink. The woman lifted her arms in unison, revealing a deep orange glow on her forearm. The helicopter descended for a closer look. It spelled 'Ignis', Fire. A huge blast of flames rushed down the alley, writhing and twisting like serpents, it engulfed the police and soared its way upwards towards the camera. The footage went black. The bar was filled with laughter and hearty cheers, more drinks were ordered. 

&amp;nbsp;  


Adam sat alone, surrounded by laughter and merriment. All around him were tattooed individuals covered in incantations. A very drunk, older man was banging on next to him about the 'persecution of our ancestors' with 'history repeating itself' and the coming 'glorious magic revolution'. He wasn't speaking to anyone in particular, just whoever came close to earshot. Frankly, Adam didn't care for 'the struggle' or for much of the other people here who would regard him as one of their own. He just wanted to be unique, and now he was lumped in with them. Whilst clearing out his grandfather's attic he came across an old spell book. The ownership of spell books was outlawed by the government, a law dating back to the old, old ages of magic. But with the gradual decline and death of spoken magic, these books became nothing more than novelty collector's items. Adam didn't know why, nobody really knew, but once he tattooed 'Imperium', Power, onto his shoulder, he became imbued with the power of...literal power. He could order people around like he had the will of an emperor, and many willingly followed him. Soon word spread that tattooing magic spells onto your body gave you the ability to use that spell at will, and a new age of magic dawned. With that new age came the persecution  as taught in the history books, the rich and powerful fearful once again wishing to keep this power to themselves and out of the hands of the common people. 

&amp;nbsp;  


Now Adam was stuck in a dingy, secluded bar, one of the many hideouts for magic users, unwillingly leading the main magical resistance force. All because 'Imperium' seemed like a cool word. ",Bluesteel420

You've mad it you mission to kill all of the Demon lords, Litch kings, and dragons that havn't died yet.",Yeager_xxxiv,"""You're making a mistake,"" I stated flatly at the suit across from me. 

""Uh-huh,"" he hummed without taking his eyes off of the file he was slowly leafing through. 

My wrists ached from the cuffs. They were only slightly tight, but I couldn't stop shifting them, even though I knew it would hurt. What did it matter anyway? Everything hurt. My thoughts were coherent but I couldn't keep them in my head. I had been woken up over and over while still strapped in this chair until I felt like screaming. But I wasn't done yet. No, this wasn't my first dance. 

The suit set down the file and stared at me for a while. I didn't bother staring back.

""It appears that you have managed to personally to increase the protection status of several already rare and endangered species with your attempts to eradicate them. Most people are rather fond of dragons and unicorns after all... at a distance anyway. Congratulations.""

I rolled my eyes. It's not like I didn't see that coming. 

""Also, you've been a very visibly leading a... We'll call it a segregation movement regarding,"" he paused, checking the file, ""the so-called 'demon' and 'lich' kinds. I'm sure you are aware that they consider those terms derogatory,"" he chided. 

I straightened up at that. ""It's what they are. It's what we called them before we made deals with them. Before we decided we wanted more than machines, more than we could do by ourselves...""

""Yes, before. Before we had spiritual guides to connect us or help us through trauma, or have the ability to have a true afterlife when tragedy strikes. Oh no, what have we become?!"" He chuckled softly. 

I turned my head away. There was no point in arguing with someone so sunk in their convictions. Just like there was no point in talking to me, I realized. And they had to know this. So, what was the point to all this? They weren't actually trying to get me to give up any information. They certainly weren't trying to convert me. Or torture me in general, really. I mean, it wasn't that bad by my standards. I was missing something here.

As if on cue, the suit spoke up, ""Look, we're not going to just let people kill magical, rare animals. Or spirits or the after-lifers, of course. If anything, they have advantages that we can only dream of. Disadvantages too...""

""Like being monsters.""

He pointed at me, ""And yet you are considered the monster here. Spirits are volatile and the after-lifers have impulse control issues, sure... There's treatments for those though. But you? You want genocide.""

""They are unnatural!"" I shouted hoarsely at him. I lunged in the chair, feeling metal digging into my wrists but not caring.

""They are as natural as you are. Less crazy though."" He sighed and gathered up the file, signalling someone behind the mirror to come. This usually led to water. Fine by me. 

A soldier strode into the room with the cup and effectively shoved the straw into my mouth. I got a few swallows before it was pulled away. It was warm and metallic, but I wasn't in a position to argue or even care. In fact, I felt rather comforted by the warmth and the tangy bitterness was somehow enjoyable, like drinking water from a hose left in the sun. Some deep tension inside of me relaxed. 

""You've been here for some time now, you know. Actually, do you know? Do you know how long you've been here?"" 

I shrugged, ""Couple of days.""

""Weeks,"" he corrected. ""Couple of weeks.""

I laughed, ""That's ridiculous.""

""Do you remember how you got here? What happened right before you woke up here?""

I struggled to think back. I was so tired, but I tried to think back to before all that... ""I was... In a car... No, on a stage... Or, wait...""

""You were shot. By someone the crowd. We did not catch who it was,"" he paused and muttered, ""but we weren't particularly trying either.""

""But... Weeks, you said...""

""Dying kind of takes it out of a person. Apparently hurts a bit too, which is what you're feeling. We let you sleep for a few days at a time before waking you up to assess if the process is taking. And to give you your treatment, which apparently helps make the transition more comfortable. Sitting the whole time can't actually hurt you. Not now.""

""Not now..."" I repeated weakly. I twisted my wrists in the cuffs. They didn't hurt even as I felt the skin catch and tear. I had just believed they should. They didn't even bleed and I hadn't noticed. 

""As far as I'm concerned, we would've been better off with you staying dead. But,"" he sighed, ""after-lifers are into second chances and all that. I was outvoted."" He stood up and turned to leave. 

""Wait."" 

He paused and turned back. 

""How long... Do I...  What now?""

He shrugged. ""Hard to say. Everyone's different. Maybe you should think about the future while you're here. Someone who gives a damn will eventually be assigned to you."" He shook his head and continued, ""For now, just keep in mind that the treatments help you, so don't go resisting them just to be difficult. I don't care if you refuse. And maybe stop doing that, "" he said, gesturing at my scraped up wrists, ""You're undead now; healing takes a lot longer. But, again, I don't care so don't expect me to give a shit if you cut your hand off doing that.""

""I'm a monster..."" I whispered. 

""You're as natural as anyone. Except for being crazy. Like I said. So, yeah, you are a monster. But maybe death will knock some sense into you."" 

I numbly watched him go. Already, I could feel the heaviness of exhaustion coming on. Yes, the pain was so much less after that ""water"" - how had I not noticed? 

So, what now? I had died. And now I was this...thing. I knew how to kill myself. Fire. Acid. Compacted. A handful of other ways. But, why punish myself for an atrocity they committed? 

No, I decided as my lids drooped and my vision blurred. The suit was right: It would have been better if I had died. For me. And for them. For I would have vengeance and my righteous cause driving me onwards.

Yes, I could see where I went wrong before: I thought I could talk to people, get them to understand. It had almost worked, but almost was as good as never in the long run. But now, because of them, I had the long run in front of me. I had centuries now to simply destroy them myself. Yes, I would use my second chance to punish them and to make this corrupted world burn until magic and spirits were just stories no one believed...

""Sure"" I replied.

After we got him to his feet, he got me to help carry him to their car. ""Anyway I better report this to the city so we can get payed. Here's hoping pays for tonight's drinking binge."" The man said angerly. 

""How much did he drink anyway?"" I asked.

"[WP] You live in a sword and sorcery style fantasy world. Enough time has passed that civilization has entered the space age with magic still surviving. You've mad it you mission to kill all of the Demon lords, Litch kings, and dragons that havn't died yet.",Yeager_xxxiv,"**""No way... what's a Ancient\-level monster doing here in the middle of the Capital...?""** 

It was a composite entity that stood three meters tall, made of countless human bones. It was designed to resemble a being with a very long neck, wings, and four legs — a Dragon. Its tail, also made from innumerable cartilages, thumped the ground as it roared out ferociously.

The monster was a Skeletal Dragon, one of the most dangerous beasts in the world.

""Regroup! There's no way we can defeat it right now!"" Adventurer Osiris, famous guild leader of *Knights Council*, ordered his teammates to retreat back into formation. ""Orie, send a message back to Adventurer's Guild that we need all available warriors to come into battle. Double time.""

""Yes, sir,"" With that, the messenger immediately dashed onto the rooftops in the city and disappeared across the horizon.

""Do you think we can defeat it?"" Din stepped forward, the right\-hand man of Osiris and trusted companion asked prudently. 

""Perhaps,"" Osiris bark a「 Battle Appraisal」spell, the report indicated that the monster is at least Level 120. For most adventurers, they were below Level 100 while Osiris is at Level 103. ""This will be unlike anything we have fought for the past decade. It'll be extremely difficult.""

""If even a 'Master\-tier' adventurer like you say something like this,"" Din said in a worried tone, ""Then we really have no chance but to wait for reinforcement.""

In this world, ranks are given in the following order: bronze, silver, gold, platinum, diamond, master and hero, with latter being the highest and most powerful.

The rank, 'Master\-tier' is conferred to multiple talented elites adventurers that help resolve problems at the national problems. In the adventurer's guild, they stand near the pinnacle, right below the apex of 'Hero\-tier'.

If all adventurers in the world formed a pyramid, then 'Master\-tier' adventurers would be scarce. Currently, there are only twelve with Osiris being one of the dozen. 

There are currently four 'Hero\-tier' adventurers in this century, with one busy assisting with the development of space\-travel and one notably far away in the Western Province, handling against a rising Demon Lord.

The remaining two were unknown. 

Many of Osiris's teammates were Platinum\-tier, with a few in Diamond. Despite the disparity in rank, they were the renowned and respected as the best guild in the nation.

""Where are the other Master\-tier?"" Din asked.

""They are currently on their way. Muse from *Forward* *Onto Dawn* and Raynie from *League of Legends* should be here soon. As for others, it'll take them at least an hour to arrive.""

""So that means we just have to hold this ground until they come, right?"" Din smiled, preparing his battle staff, engraved with enchantment jewels. ""Looks like all is not lost for this city.""

""Still, be careful. Skeletal Dragons are the elites of all Dragons,"" Osiris touched the permanent scar above his forehead, reminiscing about his previous fight with a similar monster like this.

Osiris began barking commands at his teammates and other guild members that joined in, hoping that they can stall enough time for a miracle turnaround.

""Unit A, distract the beast. Unit B, fire all offensive spells. Unit C, maintain support. Rest of you lots and adventurers, follow me on my go.""

In this world, Dragons were the strongest enemies one could encounter. They boasted great physical attack and defense power, boundless stamina and possessed numerous skills and spells. 

They were in a class of their own from countless monsters in this world.

Even if Osiris makes it out alive, he knows that not everyone would. In his mind, he silently wondered where are the remaining 'Hero\-Tier' duo are. 

Within the 'Hero\-tier', these two known as 'Duality' were infamous for neglecting quests and battles that threaten against humankind. This is why when it comes to national problems like this, 'Master\-tiers' are frequently called to the test. 

However, regarding skills, magic, and power, they stood at the zenith of human potential. In fact, if there was even a tier above Hero, those two alone would stand at least five\-tier above. 

Osiris knows this because he had seen the two defeat a God\-Level monster, Elder Dragon Lord, within a few minutes. A God\-Level is at least Level 150 and would give the entire 'Master\-Tier' dozen trouble and even the other two 'Master\-Tier' a somewhat challenging time. 

But what's more impressive is that the two never ask for help. As their name suggests, Duality comprised of Yang, the swordsman \(frontline\) and Yin, the magician \(backline\).

It is unsure whether the duo members of 'Duality' are in fact human. Their identities are concealed with their signature Wolf and Fox\-Kabuki Masks and daunting crimson\-red capes that cover their entire body.

The Skeletal Dragon swiped its forepaw at the charging soldiers, many of them immediately flew back from the impact. The wind of its passing breezed Osiris's hair as the remaining warriors charged towards at its chest.

Sensing this, Skeletal Dragon immediately breathes out a scorching cone of nova\-flame, engulfing many of the adventurers into ashen crisp. Osiris immediately leaped straight upwards into the sky and charged towards the neck region as he muttered 「Boost」.

Like a rocket launching, Osiris raised his right hand beside his head, charging his attack with magic. With the Gauntlet of Resilience, the weapon that allows the user to temporarily gain increasing power with each punch, Osiris knows that he will be able to hurt the monster overtime.

BOOM! 

""Gotcha,"" The beast fell back from the damaging impact as if a colossal boulder had dropped directly on top of it.

「Boost!」, Osiris shouted repeatedly as he leaped in various directions while simultaneously delivering constant blows to Skeletal Dragon. Like an irritating fly tangling onto its target, the beast roared in fury and pain and swiped wildly. The adventurers marveled in pure awe as a sense of morale floored back in.

""As expected of a 'Master\-Tier' Hero! That's Osiris, the Rocket Vanguard for you""

""Yes, we can totally win this! Let's go team!""

""Everyone! Back up Osiris.""

As Osiris was about to deliver his next punch, the Skeletal Dragon screeched loudly as if it was muttering a spell of its own. It flings its wings repeatedly and razor\-sharp bone shards burst out, impaling anything in its ray of vision.

Parts of the city were instantly destroyed as it slowly turned in a clockwise motion. Seeing this, Osiris knows he has to do something before all his teammates die.

「Boost!」Osiris leaped again but this time Skeletal Dragon expected its attack. With a defensive swipe, Osiris flew backward from the force and crashed into a house nearby, shattering the rooftop along the way.

His armor now tattered in ruins and mouth filled with blood. His back and right arm were broken from the collision. It's still a wonder how he survived the attack. Din and the officers quickly teleport to him and muttered healing spells.

""Looks like I am out of the battle,"" Osiris sighed as he could only stare helplessly at the Skeletal Dragon in the distance, exterminating with the remaining soldiers with another scorch of flame.

""We did what we could, Osiris,"" Din smiled bitterly, then turning around to the leading commanders behind him to issue the retreat order. He then places Osiris's left arm on his shoulder, ""You are going to be alright, my friend.""

Just then, the atmosphere immediately changed, the azure sky overcast with a sudden darkness as an ominous presence shuddered everyone's heart.

The battle seemed to take a temporary cease of fire as everyone gazed up to study this anomaly. Everyone, including the monster, all turned towards the source. 

Standing on the peak of a church tower were two cloaked adventurers, wearing their signature masks. Their crimson\-red capes waved prominently in the wind as they stood there with a calm demeanor.

""No way... Is it them?""

""It's Duality,"" Osiris grinned. ""Looks like they did show up after all.""

The Fox\-Kabuki adventurer raised her arm and flicked her finger gently, minutes later a colossal pillar of blinding light reign down onto Skeletal Dragon. The beast loudly screeched in agony.

Osiris and the rest could barely open their eyes from the radiating light. But the two duo remained unfazed.

Then suddenly, the Wolf\-Kabuki adventurer casually brought out his sword. In the flash of a second, Osiris thought he had disappeared from the roof but quickly came back. It appeared like a distortion in an image.

And that's when he realized that during that split\-second, the Wolf\-Kabuki adventurer had sliced through the Skeletal Dragon into halves.

Bones after bones collapsed onto the ground as everyone realized that the battle was over.

""Impossible... To defeat the Skeletal Dragon with one hit...""

""And that magic... Never have I seen a 『 Light Pillar 』that big... It must be God\-Tier Magic...""

""Did that really just happen?!,"" Din's eye opened wide in disblief. ""Did they really just took it out in mere seconds...?!""

Osiris can only chuckle in response, unable to fully conceive at how supremely strong those two are for defeating a Skeletal Dragon in the ten seconds they were here.

The duo then turned their heads towards Osiris, giving him a slight nod before disappearing into pixels with a 『 Teleportation 』 spell. 

Just then, Raynie and Muse and their guild members arrived in the far horizon but appeared confused since there was no enemy to be seen.

Osiris then collapsed tiredly onto the ground and muttered softly.

""Just who are these two people?""

You've mad it you mission to kill all of the Demon lords, Litch kings, and dragons that havn't died yet.",Yeager_xxxiv,"(Weird to be tweaking my own prompt so much but this idea came to me afterword) 


The magic battery in my car had died. I had always wanted to visit in Renea, but I never thought that I would have to come here like this. I didn't have much of a home left after the demon attack, not that i had much of one to begin with. My parents both died last year so it was more of house then a home. I still hope everyone else from my town got away though. At least I can walk into the city with a clean slate and maybe make something of my self.

*Grrrr*

""What..."" I looked around my shoulder to see what just made that sound. A beast that looked like a lion crossed with a bear and a bull was sniffing my card a few yards behind me. I shuddered and walked back as slowly as I could to try and get away without it noticing me.


*Snap* I realized that i steeped on a twig.""oh no.."" It turned it's head towards me and began clawing at the ground, like it was about to charge. I turned around and ran for the lights of the city!


It let out a roar as it chased me. ""No! NO! HELP! Someone Help me!"" I could see the shape of a bar forming in the distance. ""If I can get inside I'll be safe.. i hope."" I could feel the monster getting closer to me. I knew it was faster, if I couldn't get their soon then... I knew i wouldn't get there.


Just when I thought it would get to me, I saw someone stammer out the door and point something at me.


*BANG!*


I felt something slide past my cheek and before I knew it... the beast hit the floor. 


The man that had saved my life strided towards me. He had dirty blond hair and green eyes. He was wearing a rum stained brown trench coat that looked like it could use a wash, and he had two seven shot revolvers that looked like they had a knife welded onto the underside and a broad sword tied to his belt. ""Oh that god, thank you for saving m-""


""Fucking demons,"" he said as he pointed his gun towards the struggling beasts body. *BANG* ""where do you get off ruining my fucking night,"" *BANG*""Making me put down my fucking drink,""*BANG*""And putting me in a bad fucking mood!"" *BANG BANG BANG*. The beast whimpered as its bullet wounds started to burn and smoke.


""Umm..."" I said awkwardly. He turned around to look at me. ""Thank you for saving me.""


""Oh right."" He manged to spout out in a drunken slur. ""I forgot you were there.""


""If it weren't for you i'd be dead right now"" I said. Before I could continue, the monster started raising up. Watch out! I yelled out.


""Oh right, I forgot to cut off the head."" As soon as he said that, he spun around and pulled his sword out. Before I knew it, the monsters head had fallen to the ground. ""Anyway kid i've got to..."" Before he could finish, he fell down and passed out

He then raised his gun and laid it on the counter pointed towards her. A newspaper concealed the gun, and even though his finger was not on the trigger, the threat was obvious. 


The teller looked over the man's face, then down at the gun. Finally she opened up the note she had been given and gave it a quick read. Without even glancing back at the gun, she gave the man a quick nod, and then walked away from the counter. 


It was in this moment the man feared he had made a grave mistake. 


*She's going to call the cops! This isn't a good plan at all!* 


The man hadn't thought too much about his plan. He figured all he needed to do was drive out to some small town and rob a local community bank. It wasn't like he needed millions of dollars. He just needed a few thousand to get him out of debt and back on his feet. 


A trickle of sweat ran down the man's neck as he looked around. There were only two teller windows, and the other one wasn't even occupied. Behind him in the waiting area, an elderly lady sat transfixed on a box TV in the far corner. No one was looking at him, yet he felt exposed to the world. 


The man's attention was brought back to the counter as he saw the woman approach carrying a bag. It was not terribly large, but it seemed to have enough weight that the woman exerted herself a little as she lifted it up onto the counter. Wiping her brow, she smiled at him as she pushed the bag over to him. 


*What in the world is going on here?*


He hesitated as he realized he had to do something with his gun in order to pick up the bag. He brought both arms behind him as he fumbled to stick the gun in his waistband under his shirt. He was certain he did a poor job concealing the process with the newspaper, but the old lady behind him did not call out or raise an alarm.


Speaking of alarms, he heard none. Nor any police car sirens outside. With the money bag in hand, he turned around. No flashing lights, either. 


He turned back to the teller and she appeared busy getting ready for the next customer. Her eyes flicked up at him. 


""Have a good day, sir."" she said. Then she went back to her task. 


Confused, the man started for the exit. He tried to act calm and hoped he appeared nonchalant to the old lady watching the TV. As he reached the door, he gave a look back to the teller and expected to see her on the phone with the cops. She wasn't and she appeared to have already forgotten about his existence, so he opened up the door and walked out onto the street. 


The man looked around. No cops. No sirens. He began walking along the sidewalk and then dashed around a corner towards his parked car and waited.


Still no cops or sirens. Puzzled, he opened up the bag and was actually surprised to see it filled to the brim with cash. He patted his chest pocket and reached for his keys. Inside his pocket, he felt a piece of paper and pulled it out. It was a note:


*This is a robbery. I have a gun. Put $10,000 cash into a bag and no one gets hurt.*  


The man felt his body go cold. This was the note he had intended to give the bank teller. If he hadn’t given her this note, then what note had he actually given her?",happywriter23

I'd blown my last five bucks on a bacon-wrapped hot dog, my jeans were riding up on my ass with the sweat. And then I saw it, out the corner of my eye, a white plastic sign with black blocky letters. ""Second Union Bank"". 

Second Union? I'd heard of First Union, but there was no way these guys were legit. I'd already applied for every Craigslist job in the last three months, and mostly spent my afternoons loitering anyway, so I crossed Pine Avenue to sneak a peek inside under the guise of checking my phone. 

A marble room with a low ceiling, no carpet, and a single teller's booth peeked out through the tinted glass. Security was nowhere to be seen. I sat at the steps for what felt like hours, waiting for someone to pass by, or get thrown out. When nothing happened, I scrawled a note, hands shaking, and pulled open the door. A rush of cool air greeted me. The teller didn't look up from her computer. 

""Hi."" My voice cracked as I handed the paper over. Every fiber in my body screamed at me to run, to call the whole stupid thing off. 

""Oh. Good afternoon and welcome to Second Union. What can I get for you?"" She turned her chin towards me and back to the computer, all without averting her gaze. 

""I uh. I have this for you."" I set the sweaty, grimy note on the counter. The teller started typing. ""Hey."" I raised my voice. ""You might want to read that."" 

My change in tone was enough to tear her gaze from the screen. Her electric blue eyes shot from me, to the note, back to the screen. With a sigh, she pulled a duffel bag from her desk and set it on the counter. ""Thank you for visiting Second Union."" 

I checked the bag. Brand new, black vinyl, and stuffed to the brim with what looked like hundred dollar bills. ""Wait, just to be clear, I'm not applying for a loan."" 

She nodded. ""I read the letter."" 

""How do I know these are all real?"" I asked, leaning against the counter. My legs refused to hold steady. 

""Check them."" She handed me one of those retail pens that turns black on regular paper. I drew a line across a few stacks. They checked out. 

""This is a robbery!"" I said a little louder, though still using my indoor voice. I checked behind me for cameras and found none. 

""Uh huh."" She turned the screen away as I leaned over the counter to look at it. ""Sir, do you want the money or not?"" 

I coughed. ""I. Yes. I want the money."" I slung the duffel bag over the shoulder and, after a moment's thought, grabbed my note. Wouldn't do to leave any evidence. ""Goodbye."" 

As I walked outside, the adrenaline that had been holding me together subsided into a flood of tears and panic. ""Oh my god. Oh my god."" 

""You okay, son?"" I felt a hand on my shoulder. 

""No. No, I'm not. I just did something terrible."" I shook my head and pressed the duffel bag into my stomach as if it were a teddy bear. 

""Want to talk about it?"" I wiped the tears from my bleary eyes and choked as I realized I was face to face with a cop. ""Officer Matthews"", his badge read. 

""I. Um."" Of course. My life was over. Caught red handed and he was just fucking with me. ""I robbed a bank. I robbed a bank, okay? There. I said it. I'm guilty.""

""Oh, is that all? Second Union, right? Why don't you take some of that money down to the ice cream parlor and treat yourself to a double scoop of Aunt Mirabelle's Rocky Road with extra marshmallows? I can tell you've had yourself a heck of a day."" He patted me on the shoulder and got up, entered his car, and drove off. 

""What? No. NO."" I shouted, and kicked the bag. ""What is this place?"" I picked it up and headed back towards Second Union. The girl still didn't look up from the computer. 

""Take your money back."" I said, through shuddering breaths. 

""K."" She grasped for the bag I held just out of her reach.

""But first, just tell me... why?"" I wiped a trail of tears and snot down the side of my button-up. ""Why isn't there any security? Why'd the cop just let me go? Why is everyone just letting me walk out of here?"" 

She turned to face me, and, for the first time, we made eye contact. Now I'm not saying it wasn't the air conditioning, but at that very moment, a terrible chill shot through my body. Goosebumps poked out through my sweat. 

""Because it works better this way."" She said, grinning a smile that showed a few too many teeth. She grabbed the bag, tucked it under her desk, and resumed typing. 

I collapsed against the counter. ""Tell me something else. What kind of work are you doing that's so important you wouldn't stop for a robbery?"" 

She typed a final line on her keyboard. ""Nothing much. Just going over some job applications."" 

My phone buzzed. I had an email from Second Union.

[WP] You are one of Satan’s many kids. After centuries of feeling ignored you decide to rebel and be the nicest demon in hell.,razorhawk421,"It was a Sunday afternoon, Harry hurriedly walked down the icy street, making his way down to the bus stop. He grimly gripped onto his umbrella as the sleet\-packed wind did its best to rip it out of his hands. The pavement was wet, the road was wet, and the benches were wet, suddenly a bus roared past him, showering him in a wall of cold, brown water, drenching him completely. The shock jolted the umbrella out of his hands and the wind gleefully swept it away, the umbrella bounced along the pavement for a few seconds before getting snagged on a light post. “Oh great,” Harry thought bitterly, “now I am wet too.”

He grumbled about the awful weather, the existence of puddles near pavements and his miserable day as he trudged his way to the edge of the pavement where the umbrella trembled in the wind. Water was in his shoes, his hair, and it dripped into his eyes, stinging them and making everything blurry. As he bent down to retrieve the umbrella, his shoes gave out from underneath him as they lost their grip on the ice\-capped concrete, Harry stumbled forward, hands flailing, determined not to fall and suffer any further humiliation on top of what he has already endured. “Aha!” Harry shouted as he regained his balance, “not today Life, take that ya\-\-”

Harry could not finish his verbal jab at life and fortune, as he found it quite difficult to speak when you are being run\-through by a sixteen\-wheeler.

Harry head spun as he felt the truck passing through him, separating his consciousness from his body, pulverising his internal organs and shattering his bones with an almighty crunch, the sensation was sickening and Harry doubted that he would ever eat another packet of Doritos ever again. The whole incident was over in just a few seconds. Harry’s now\-separated consciousness stared at his own body, what is left of it anyhow, and felt… surprisingly little. The bits and pieces were kinda disgusting, but other than that, Harry did not have any strong emotional response of the experience, it was never as if he liked life that much anyway.

“Hello there”

“Agh!” Harry screamed as he felt someone tapping on his shoulder, he twisted around and fell on his back. The voice belonged to a charming young man in his early twenties, he wore black jeans, a black T\-shirt, black sneakers and a black leather bracelet. His hand was still outstretched, and he looked as if he was startled by Harry’s dramatic reaction.

“You will be Harry, I presume?” He slowly withdrew his hand, and took a slow step towards Harry. “This should not come as a surprise to you, but there is still no easy way to tell this to someone; you are dead.”

“Uuh, thanks, I sort of figured that out by myself,” Harry said as he gestured at bits of himself scattered across the asphalt, “And do you happen to be General Kenobi?”

“General Ken\- oh, that’s one of those “reference” things you humans have. My name is actually Acanath Satanson the Devourer of Souls, but my friends call me Elliot.” Acanath\-the\-Devourer\-of\-souls smiled sweetly as he extended his hand to help Harry up off of the floor, “I am here to make your transition into the afterlife as smooth as possible.” Harry took his hand, which was actually surprisingly soft, seeing how he was basically a demon, and pulled himself back up.

“Uuh, hi Elliot,” Harry smiled back nervously, “I am pleased to meet you.”

“Pleased to meet me?” Acanath laughed as he wrapped an arm around Ghost\-Harry’s shoulder and lead him to a nearby bench, where they sat down, “Now that is something I don’t often hear from many people. Honestly some of them can be so rude, last Friday this Florida man tried to stab me with a penknife and I had to, erm, anyway, I am rambling again. You seem like a good bloke. Do you want to hear about the various afterlife options on offer at the moment?”

“W\-what did you do to him?”

“Who?”

“The guy from Florida”

“Oh, I had to run out of his house to avoid getting stabbed and I ended up having to explain the whole situation to him from his lawn instead, it was all really boring.” Acanath waved his hand through the air, “ Ever since my decision to break free from my father, I have been trying to tone down my methods of soul collecting. I used to obey my father and went along with the pitchfork and choking thing, but now I would rather try to convince people, well, ex\-people, to come along quietly. I can explain to you as well on how death is inevitable and there is no point in struggling forever but you seem to be taking it quite well. Anymore questions before we move on?”

“Y\-you are the son of Satan, which makes you a demon.”

“Mmmhm.”

“So I am going to hell?” Harry asked with tears in his eyes. Sure, he was not the model citizen, he had his share of some littering, laziness and bad words, but hell? 

“Nah, I told you, I am breaking free from my old man, I am becoming my own demon. I am sick of being overshadowed by that upstart Grim Reaper, he is such an attention hogger, dressed in that outfit all the time. And the worst thing is that my father buys it, everyday it is Grim\-Reaper\-this, Grim\-Reaper\-that. Acanath, be more like your brother. Acanath, stop sneaking people into heaven.”

“Sneaking people into heaven?”

“Yup, I have got to empathise with you, Hell really sucks. Dad has this whole fire and brimstone decor going on for almost two thousand years now and he is still not tired of it, plus all the screaming from the torture pits, it is all just so noisy and annoying. So I’ve decided my first step in becoming my own demon is to sneak as many people into heaven as I can.”

Harry visibly relaxed, “So you can get me into heaven? What is it like?”

“Ah, that just leads into our afterlife options, you see, after you die, you can choose how to spend your afterlife, the first option is what you call heaven. Although instead of harps and clouds and chubby babies flying around on physics\-defying wings, think of it as a really big coffee shop with a book store, soft cushions and even wi\-fi. If that is not your cup of tea, excuse the pun, there are always other variations of themes filled with like\-minded individuals. I do really think you would love the coffee shop though, it seems to be right up your alley.”

“Wow, that sounds amazing,” Harry gazed dreamily into the distance, as Death described the giant\-coffee\-shop\-in\-the\-sky, he was so mesmerised by the image that he did not even notice the policemen who were trying to keep the curious onlookers away, nor did Harry notice the paramedics who were trying to find all of his body parts.

[WP] All of the ice on Antarctica has melted revealing a unknown portal.,Mythical_NZer,"***Antarctica 2043 Research Ship Helena***

***Entry Log 1***

Years and years of Global Warming has melted the polar icecaps, leading to the findings of a mysterious portal smack dab in the center of Antarctica. U.N. Members have tasked volunteers to go South and see what they could find.

The Portal seems to be massive in size. Estimates put the size at around 100 meters wide. We don't know what this thing is. It could be the Russians, or the Chinese, but they are just as confused as we are.

We don't know what's down there, but we'll find out eventually. We're still waiting for the go to try and throw cameras in there.

***Entry Log 2***

We got the go today to throw some camera's into the Portal. The French threw theirs first, and transmitted the signal to all ships in the area. But then Marcus called me out the deck, and we saw the French ship get sucked into the Portal. The Captain replayed the footage but the transmission cut out as soon as their transmitter was sucked in. So we got nothing.

***Entry Log 3***

After the incident with the French Ship, all U.N. members agreed to have an exclusion zone about 3 Kilometers away from the Portal edge, to prevent any further incidents. Also, it has been reported that the sea level has dropped by 4 inches, and it's only been a week. Someone better do something, or we're gonna run out of water.

***Entry Log 4 ... \*deleted\****

***Entry Log 5 ... \*deleted\****

***Entry Log 6***

It's been a month now, since the Portal was found. Another ship got sucked in after losing it's bearings. It headed straight into the Portal. It was a Russian ship. Now more countries are pulling out to prevent any more losses. 

***Entry Log 7 ... \*deleted\****

***Entry Log 8 ... \*deleted\****

***Entry Log 9***

Radio signals were heard coming from the Portal. At first it was mostly static, but then someone heard the words ""*Aidez... nous...""* It was French for... Help Us.

She always used to say that there was no difference between us. She’d say, ‘It doesn’t matter what color your costume is, everyone’s blood is simply red.’

I can’t promise what will happen tomorrow. We may go back to fighting, we may not. But, as I look across the room, for this one day, I see neither hero nor villain.

"[WP] You're a time traveler who's been captured by tipped off government secret service agents in 1917. So far, you haven't given away any information in the interrogation. Until you accidentally refer to the great war as world war one.",The--Ferryman,"December 30th 1917

“Bring einen Übersetzer mit”

Officer Richmond of the Germany secret service stared at the sight infront of his eyes. In the interrogation chair was a tall blonde pale man in a loose branded shirt. He refused to talk and understands no German. He seems to relaxed. He must be a British spy, but what they were thinking sending him into our trenches. He was getting nowhere. He called for a translator

In the chair Daniel fry of the CIA Area 51 was as calm as you could be in this situation. He watched as the translator walked in, and he knew he had to talk

“What’s your name” Said the translator

“Daniel fry” 

“Why are you here”

“To learn”

“Do you work for the British”

No response. The German officer was getting frustrated. Nervously the translator told him the answers. Then continued.

“The British are winning the Great War. What do you have to gain with your infiltration of our base.” The translator was starting to stress. Daniel tried to be secretive with his next answer 

“To see WW1. To see your glorious troopers in battle”. Daniel realised his mistake but it was too late.

“WW1” the translator questioned. Daniel stayed silent. The translator went back to the officer and spoke back. “Sir, I believe that this man is not the usual. He is insane or not from our time, more likely the first” the officer showed no reaction. The translator moved back to Daniel.

“Daniel, may I please check your pockets” no response. The translator put his hand into the front pocket of his pants and pulled out a black metal structure. The Germans were shocked. The officer moved forward and touched it. A colour picture of a strange tall metallic Screen with smaller ones around it taken from a sidewalk full of people flashed onto the metal. The board showed random pictures and advertisements and one stated that this is time square in New York. In white uniformed text infront of the photo was the time and a date. 31st may 2018.

“Come with us” Said the translator 

APRIL 1945

The kaser stood on the rotating glass platform. Fitted into the reichtag. Now the governing palace of the new order of Germanic empire. A grey futuristic New York style city of Berlin stared back, inspired by Daniels accounts and the pictures on his “Apple iPhone”. Held by a bodyguard called hitler, a old Daniel stared back.

“ I assume you know who my bodyguard is, it’s amazing how different tactical positions changed the Great War. I’ve been thinking about killing you for a while Daniel, but I wanted you to see the day Germany fell, and see how thanks to you it has thrived. Bringing Europe and North America together as one. You will witness our nuclear weapons, more advanced then ever, be launched onto Moscow, finally crumbling the ussr after months of conflict. Then you will die, any last words” the emperor of the Atlantic curled his words in his mouth.

“Yes” Said Daniel, “when you launch the nukes the world could never be restored to my timeline. And it will create a grandfather paradox”.

“So” asked the emperor. As he pressed the button and the word disintegrated. Forming a ruined richtag and a bombed Berlin invaded by the USSR and with a dead hitler in a bunker.

[WP] Gods exist and they play video games. An account has risen rapidly to the top of the leaderboards in a game called ‘Earth’. A notoriously difficult and buggy game that has plagued gamer Gods for years.,Theyogibearha,"""How does the game work?"" asked C'huchalla as his talons vibrated. His Avian features flourished in interest. ""It seems so... violent.""

""Earth,"" mused the ancient professor, a diety named Timadriel. Her form was made of pure light, pulsing with her words. ""Is a game of conflict. You pick a people and guard them against other gods, driving your conquests forward. The objective is to expand your people to the ends of the Earth, and beyond.""

""And what is so hard about that?"" C'huchalla grazed Timadriel's aura with a slash of her limbs. ""As you conquer; the fighting should ease. It should be easy to snowball to domination, as it is with Mars.""

""Earth was designed differently. While Mars has but ten starting players, Earth has infinite. Any may join in."" Timadriel pulled up a screen. ""See how this faith prospered?""

A turn counter appeared, and showed the spread of Buddhism in India. It expanded and contracted over time, eventually synchronizing with the myriad Hindu alliances. ""Buddha,"" Timariel began, ""invaded India proper initially. He thought that convincing the simulation that it was a simulation would see him to victory. But, his empire fell much the same as the others. You can only grow so much before other dieties spawn in your weak spots.""

""So, who wins?"" C'huchalla glanced at the leaderboard. ""It appears that Mars leads on Earth as well.""

The screen zoomed to Europe, and depicted a rising tide of red. The Hellenic alliance reeled back as their territory in Greece fell. The Gallic gods likewise relented, and disconnected. Finally, the red tide surrounded a small diety in Judea. 

""He is a fighter,"" spoke Timadriel. ""Yahweh leads the unaligned faction. He does not invest in his people's attributes or genetics, but holds onto his prayer power to work miracles, call down firestorms and the like.""

Just as quickly, the territory turned red.  Yet, Yahweh's leaderboard continued to rise.

""Whatis happening?"" Asked C'huchalla. ""Why didn't he quit in rage?""

Slowly, the pace of his leaderboard quickened, yet the red tide of Mars remained and fought incursions by the Germanic and Hunic legions. Though they expanded territory, their players howled in frustration. Yahweh's score began rising exponentially.

""Looks like he found an exploit.""

"[WP] You're a D-list demon hunter, answering a call way above your rank to try and impress the Hunters League.",Timeshatterer,"Cool story, man! Love the way you make us feel like Esther's trials really are impossible. Let me give you some opinions:

* Watch out for punctuation and for the text's structure as a whole; some parts of your text felt a bit rushed because you used a comma instead of a period, or because there was no punctuation at all.

&gt; Tears welling up in her eyes Esther began to think clearly for the first time, Helliacals have control over fire, smoke, and the aspect of light that is blinding or burning.

That's the original. I'd trade the comma before ""Helliacals"" for a period, for example. Here's what I mean:

&gt; Tears welling up in her eyes, Esther began to think clearly for the first time. *Helliacals have control over fire, smoke, and the aspect of light that is blinding or burning*, she thought, remembering the lessons Father Ezekiel taught her.

* Try and describe your MC as well as possible. I'd've loved to know if Esther was strong or weak, physically; if she was black or white, tall or short, ugly or fair. These details add to the experience, in fictional texts. In a more grounded work, sure, you could skip it, but Esther could really have used a description. She reminded me a lot of Vayne, from League of Legends, because of the whole demon-hunter thing. Maybe check her up, see if it fits.

Otherwise, your text was a joy, and really showed how Esther fought against all odds to beat the Helliacal! If you feel like it, please write a part II, I'd love to hear it. Hope this little description is helpful, and my DM is open if you wanna talk! :D",Timeshatterer

[WP] Every Human Being is born with two tarot birth cards granting them unique powers. You were born with the Lovers and the Devil.,Deity_Of_Death,"""Lover, Devil, all the same, really."" I said to my 'hostage'. I could call him that all day long, but the fact of the matter was he wanted to be here, in this moment. He had, at some point in the past, and even now, wanted to be here. ""Same coin, different sides. It's like heads and tails. Ask any divorcee."" I continued, walking around the room, examining the whirring machinery, the myriad of buttons and switches, and stepping over a dead body or two.

My other hostage was visibly fighting it, but it was so rare to meet someone with enough will power to change their wants so thoroughly. It was a hunger, so hard to ignore. I leaned in upon his shoulder, whispering into his ear. Not the Lover, but the Devil. ""Come now, don't you want to know what it's like? You've had the power for so long, after all. It's been building up. Let it out~"" That seemed to placate him some, his gaze steeling. Still a little taut, resisting, however.

I watched, tongue split part of its length as I licked my lips. I had always wondered what Armageddon would be like. Who knew I could cause it? After all, I was a lowly child, Lover and Devil. It made me an empathy, of sorts. Both were able to draw out feelings and self-truths. But that wasn't the truth. I could see that clear enough. They influenced people in two separate ways, though they weren't mutually exclusive. Lovers made others do things **for them**. Devils did it by making it **because of them**. The Lovers influence also required someone to at least consider me an acquaintance, and further, was much stronger. Ironically, I could influence them as a Devil into the grasp of a Lover, and increase my sway exponentially on any desire they had, no matter how deep, how dark, or how secret. 

And now? Now I stood on the brink of the end of the world. It was a glorious sensation, to have these two people at my thrall, ready to turn everything into a wasteland. True, there was a chance I would get caught, but nothing a little tug on the heartstrings couldn't fix.

I took a step back, a deep breath. Picked up the gun from the dead man's hands. I'd caused enough chaos for today. I just like knowing I have the power. My mouth open, tongue working its split influence, tangling up their wants. ""Hands off, I have a gun. You'll never get it right like this, you're coming with me. You both want that, don't you?""",DerGodhand

This passion only grew as I did, the risks and the rewards always greater than before. Of course, there were many others out there contributing to chaos. The Judgement Gangs and the Death Squads. So visually entertaining. So secure in their obvious power. So boring.


Whenever some new Death Dealer started throwing his powers around, everyone took notice. The world media whipped into a frenzy and yet every time they were brought low. Dragged in front of a Temperance Judge or hunted by Hanged Men vigilantes. Amateurs.


The first of my gifts manifested early. I'm a Lover, not a fighter I'd joke. What it actually did was allow me a type of foresight. A way to know when someone or something was heading for a huge upheaval, where they had a choice over which path to take. 


This led to fun in its own right. I used to guess what sort of split was about to open up in people's lives. The first I got right was with my father. He'd come home the next day in tears after being let go from his work. He should've chosen better.


The second gift is inherently more sinister. My mother insisted I keep that one quiet, pretend it was some pathetic Cups or Wands gift. The Devil had been with me from birth and I relished in it. It gave me an affinity for traps and misfortune.



It allowed me to know which path would lead to destruction. 

So while those born under Strength make the news, throwing cars and snapping necks, I lurk in the shadows.

Leaning out now and again to whisper in your ear.

To turn you down a certain path.

[WP] Every Human Being is born with two tarot birth cards granting them unique powers. You were born with the Lovers and the Devil.,Deity_Of_Death,"  Humans are born with two tarot card birthmarks on their body and they give us special abilities or for minor simply interesting skills. Most people have two minor, in rarer cases a major and a minor, there is only 3 of us who have two major cards. Mine are the Devil and the Lovers, its a wonderful heady combination.  

 See the powers we get depend on how the cards combine and the importance of the card. Higher numbers are more powerful then lower ones and major cards give the most power. Since each card has multiple meanings even if two people have the same cards the abilities they get can be very different. For example if you have the four of wands and the seven of swords, you might be really good at strategy games or you might be someone who host the most wonderful parties.  

 I’ve been very lucky, my cards work well together and I’ve been able to use my power to get myself a very comfortable life. Thanks to my cards I have the power to seduce almost anyone and make them addicted to me. They beg for a touch after I’m done with them. It took me a few years to figure out the best way to use my ability but it was meeting one of the other double majors that inspired me.  

 He had the Sun and the Emperor, It made him a good leader who inspired people. It was so easy to make him mine and then manipulate him into using his powers to “help” the world. Now I sit in our palace while he does all the hard work of ruling the world and I enjoy the spoils.

Why that's extraordinary!’  He slapped me on the back, hard, and roared a salute to my triumphs.  The Valkyrie slammed a cup into my gut, why is everything so violent with these people?  I’ve always found the best lies were based in the truth, so with that in mind, and taking into account my eternal soul would definitely be murdered if I was found out, that is exactly what I did.  I told them that I had died to the hand of a mighty Sun, after slaying one hundred and fifty seven of his men.  

Another one of the massive berserkers leaned into me, he had drool hanging out his mouth in long wispy lines, some of the saliva decanted itself onto my arm.  This lead to the massive human leaning down and brushing it away, ‘that’s a tan line and half there warrior, where were you fighting when you perished?’  Once again I had to be quick on my toes fleshing out a response, ‘well, that’s actually how the mighty Sun defeated me, those my friend are the scars left behind after he cut off both my arms.’  At this point I will highlight the fact that I had been drinking for several hours under the guise of being this great warrior, despite arriving in Valhalla in my jorts and cut off Led Zeppelin T-shirt, so my next move can in every way be put down to my new found after-life-inebriation.  I hooked my arm around the giant's shoulders and bought my face close to his, lifting me to the edge of my toes, ‘you wanna know the best part?’  I felt some of his drool lick my chin, ‘I killed five more men after he’d removed one arm, and another three after the second.’  The berserker shifted himself away from me, ‘three? With no arms!  How was such a feat accomplished?’  It was at this point I realised I hadn’t planned my next sentence, thinking the massive brute would just laugh and congratulate on me such an epic feat of strength...

But you have no idea what you did to get here. You died from heat stroke after wearing 157 shirts.",GreenGengar459,"""Stephen of Ohio! Welcome!""

The hall shook as hundreds of goblets slammed down on tables in unison, mead and wine sloshing over the floor. The leather-clad warriors that had guided me this far pushed me forward with a hard palm to the spine. 

At the far end of the room, a small and very ordinary looking man rose out of an ornate throne and began walking towards me. ""Stephen of Ohio! Slayer of one hundre-"" he glanced down at something in his hands as he walked, ""one hundred fifty seven foes!"" Goblets smacked down again. “Welcome brother” he shouted as he placed a hand on my shoulder. 

“Jerry?”

He squeezed me in a manly embrace, and whispered in my ear. 

“Steve. Be cool man, I don’t know what’s happening either. Last thing I know, I was in the hospital after putting on like two hundred shirts in that stupid competition to win a Mustang. Now I’m in charge of this place I think?” He started to move back, but his eyes widened and he pulled me back into the hug. “Also you’ve got to call me Odin now, don’t want to accidentally offend any of these guys.”

He pulled back, holding me by the shoulders at arm’s length. “One hundred and fifty seven! One more cheer for Stephen!” ",AKPB

But you have no idea what you did to get here. You died from heat stroke after wearing 157 shirts.",GreenGengar459,"As the uproar i have caused started to die down, i finally hear my self think.
 
The past afternoon was a wild one, given the fact that i started the day surrounded by piles of my laundry, and ended up here being surrounded by hordes of women. Tall, lean , muscular , women clad in valkyrian armor. If they hadn't been scaring me shitless with the constant howling and chest beating as they carried towards Valhalla, i would have *totally* hit that. Death by snu snu, i suppose.

""HAIL ODIN! HAIL VALHALLA!"" everyone shouted in unison for the last time as an old , one eyed old geezer raised his staff and addressed crowd.

""Welcome home my valkyries! Welcome to Valhalla , young marv! We are celebrating your arrival in the Hall of Warriors, tonight we indulge in all of your desires!"" Said Odin.

The crowd answered with roaring screams. Odin then slammed his staff into the floor 
and almost immediately the valkyries dispersed in all directions. The one carrying me lovingly one-armed threw me at the feet of Odin before flying off with her friends. Good times.

Odin picked me up from the floor, letting me pat the dust off of myself before I turned to face him.

""You did well to get here, lad. Not much of your lot have these days. A mighty fine feat , and mighty fine warrior we have , in you."" Odin said softly with a fatherly smile.

You know, growing up receiving constant bullying, you learn a thing or two about receiving compliments. Most of the time, when someone says "" Nice Vader shirt, wank solo!"" Or "" You have really strong arms for a pre-pubescent smeagol"" or "" No, son, i think you look handsome! Now go hide so you don't scare mommy's date away"" probably wasn't as nice at it sounded. But with staring into Odin himself, I could tell that his words were at least sincere. I *really* wished he wasn't though, so that i could have enjoyed my stay without feeling guilty about taking advantage of the mistake they seem to have made.

""Um, Mr. Odin? I'm very happy to be part of Valhalla and all, but I really think there's been
a mistake here. You say this hall is for deserving warriors, but the last thing i remember doing with my life was just putting on shirts. A lot of 'em."" I said as i bowed my head in shame. I didn't wanna go, but i didn't wanna stay on false pretense. Part guilt, part fear of what would happen if they found out. Those valkyries are seriously scary.

Odin surprised me as he bellowed with a laugh. ""You had 157 on , lad. I was watching. You belong here just fine, Marv.""

Growing more horrified at his sincerity, i stare at him and "" but.. why? How? What part of that makes me a warrior?""

""If you had to guess the reason why i had you sent here, what would it be? What is the key to Valhalla?"" He quipped back mysteriously, as he rubbed his thick white beard.

I ponder for a moment. I try to enumerate to myself all the qualities that'd make me a warrior. It didn't take me long to figure out zero was the answer. But then, i had an idea.

""Well, they say sometimes people see things in you that you don't see yourself. Like potential. Did you see bravery in me? Like, deep down inside i had the potential to become a warrior? The key to Valhalla is bravery, i just didn't know it yet?"" I answer, finding a new hope in myself, beaming at the thought that i might be right.

Odin broke out into more laughter. The kind of laughter from the gut that makes you bend over and hold your knees laughter. "" Oh you really are a funny one , lad! No! You're about as brave as a goat in a thunderstorm, and as sharp as my son Thor's hammer! Of course not!"" He answered as he kept laughing.

 Sincere my ass. I may have been brought here as a joke to make him laugh. That'd make more   sense given my track record. I can *not* catch a damn break. But before i could bury myself in more self-pity, odin interrupts me with a tap on the shoulder. 

""If bravery was the key to Valhalla, there'd be more of your lot here. What, with all the  violence you bring to yourselves down there, there's a lot of chances to prove yourself. Yet all of them break at the verge of death. Some for selfish reasons, some selfless, but they all greet death with a face full of tears and regret. Even the brave ones. Those who get here are more than brave, they greet death with a smile, charging head first into the fray. "" Odin put hands onto both of my shoulders and stared into my soul. ""Do you really remember what you were doing when you died?"" 

I thought back. It was almost noon back then. A hundred shirts in, I could already feel the water draining out from my body because of the heat. At 150 , i was bone dry and my vision was becoming blurry. I knew something was wrong but i kept going. For whatever reason, i just told myself had to keep going. Not that i needed to, but i *wanted* to. 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157. As life drained from me , I was smiling , holding my darth vader t-shirt, trying to put on 158.

""Smiling at death, charging into the fray. Marv, The key to Valhalla is the pursuit of Glory.""

Odin reassuringly patted me twice on the shoulder before letting go of me. He turned towards the Hall and signalled me to follow.

""Come now , lad. Let's get you some of that Snu snu.""

[WP]”Tomorrow is a brand new day.”,LordOfFlames55,"""Good morning, let's get right to business,"" Lawrence said. The greying commander spoke to his small team of physicists and other assorted scientists gathered in the briefing room. ""Last night's votes have been tallied, though I haven't checked the results yet. Before I reveal the vote, I'd like to take a moment to say a few words."" Lawrence stood from his seat, then paced around the room. 

""The things we've accomplished in this room are nothing short of miraculous, and I could not imagine a better crew to work with every day. No matter what result the votes dictate, I cannot express how honored I am to have worked with you up until today. If tomorrow comes, and we're still here, I could not think of a more fulfilling way to live my life,"" he said. The team of lab coats applauded and cheered for him. He continued after they quieted.

""Of course that brings up the question of, what if we're not here tomorrow?"" Tension stiffened the air in the room. ""There's no way of knowing how things will turn out, but I know we'll all be eager to keep in touch if we can."" A young man with pale skin and a red beard raised his hand. 

""What's on your mind, Floyd?"" Lawrence asked. 

""Assuming the vote goes a certain way,... uh \*when\*?"" he asked.

""Today, as soon as possible; it's why we started early this morning. We all agreed to go by the vote, and I don't want a chance for anyone to develop misgivings. Of course, after the vote everyone has the day off today. Enjoy it with your friends and families."" Lawrence walked back to his seat, then reached into the pocket of his white lab coat before he sat down. 

""I have the results."" The older man pulled a small white envelope from his pocket. As he sat down he opened the envelope then grabbed the folded piece of paper within. He looked at the note first, a slight sigh escaped his mouth; then he handed the paper to the red headed man to his left. 

""5 to 2 in favor of. That settles it folks,"" Lawrence said. He stood again, then walked to a small locker protected by several different biometric locks. After giving his voice, thumbprint, and retina scan the locker beeped. It opened, and he reached inside to pull out a small black box with a red button on it. He walked back to the table while cradling the black box. 

""Is everyone ready?"" He asked. The six other scientists in the room each gave some form of silent affirmation. Lawrence inserted a key into one side of the box causing the red button to glow. 

""It is with great sadness, pleasure, and honor that I fulfill the solemn duty of a Clockwatcher. No one knows when the Loop began, but we do know the first Clockwatcher that invented the first time\-shelter. His name was Jasper Freeman,"" Lawrence said. ""If he had not created the Clockwatchers, I would not be here today to end the Loop for good."" Lawrence looked around the table at the faces of his co\-workers, and friends. ""I don't know what's going to happen, but I do know one thing. Tomorrow is a brand new day for everyone in the world, not just us.""  He pressed the button.

"[WP] Millions of years after humanity's extinction by some kind of natural cataclysm, another intelligent race evolves to inhabit the Earth. You are a scientist of the new race studying the few remnants that humanity left behind.",Lord_Pear_Tree,"The Director was having a bad day. ""You know, the conspiracy nuts are all over this. It's a total shitshow.""

I was unsympathetic. ""That doesn't matter to me. This is bigger than pop culture. This is bigger than *any* culture.""

I'd been managing the Moonbase program for over 80 years, and nothing happened on the lunar surface that I wasn't aware of. When the initial reports had been sent back a month before, I'd been one of the very first to see the images.

There, standing on the barren, airless plain, stood a spider-like construction on broad circular footpads, with the bell of a primitive liquid-fuel rocket engine hanging beneath it. A ladder extended down one support, and from it several very faint tracks extended in all directions across the surface. There were other artifacts scattered about, including the now obviously purpose-built corner reflector array that had first gotten our attention, and all of them were incredibly ancient.

Three days ago the analyses, and the confirmations of those analyses, had been completed. The artifacts were between 750 and 800 million years old--nearly ten times as old as our species.

""Okay, catch me up. What do we *know* about these aliens?"" he asked.

""Well, based on the tracks and other measurements, they were about two meters long--*tall*, I mean--and weighed about a hundred kilograms.""

""Two meters *tall*?""

""Yes--they were bipeds. Our analysis indicates that they probably had two hind limbs used solely for locomotion, and two forelimbs adapted for fine manipulation.""

""That must have been interesting to see in motion--like one of our self-balancing explorer bots?""

""Yes, that's what we think. Anyway, their materials science was quite primitive. The landing craft was made almost entirely of a crude aluminum alloy, with fittings made of unalloyed titanium. And you've seen reports of their rocket technology. Based on our scans of the engine, it actually used *hypergolic* fuel.""

The Director whistled. ""Risk-takers, weren't they?""

""Indeed,"" I said. ""Some of us think that they may have had powered flight for only a thousand years or so before the Landing.""

""You're kidding! And they were already visiting other solar systems? That's pretty hard to believe...""

""Actually, Director,"" I interrupted, choosing my words carefully, ""the team is pretty convinced now that the 'aliens' actually came from here.""

""*Here?*"" he exclaimed, standing now. ""800 million years ago? I thought there was *nothing* here 800 million years ago!""

""It's true that we have no fossils from that far back, but almost the entire crust of the planet has been recycled through tectonic processes since then. Hardly any of the planet's surface is that old now. But remember, our planet is over 5.3 billion years old. Who *knows* what might have preceded us?""

The Director huffed. ""It sounds like your *team* has some idea.""

I allowed a guarded chuckle. ""Yes, *now* we do. Unfortunately, any evidence of them *here* would have been subducted into the mantle long ago. But there are other clues...""

""You mean the Ring,"" he grumbled. The Debris Ring, discovered back in the early days of spaceflight, had been a thorn in his side for his entire career as Director. We had never published the fact that much of its material hinted at artificial origins, but still the ""Ancient Aliens"" types never ceased to spout wild hypotheses about that very idea.

""Yes, the Ring. We've done some simulation to see what it might have looked like 750 to 800 million years ago, and there's a *very* good chance that most of it occupied a geosynchronous orbit.""

""A geosync-- why would they have that many artifacts in *geosynchronous* orbit?""

""We believe they were a critical part of the species' surface communications infrastructure.""

The Director's jaw dropped.

""Yes,"" I continued, ""they must have had no subspace communications tech when they first went into space. You can see now why we think that they must have accomplished this in their first millennium of flight.""

The Director looked at me intently. ""There's something else you aren't telling me.""

I swallowed--this was it.

""Yes, Director--and that's why I asked to see you.

""You've read the reports about the other artifact near the Landing site which doesn't match anything else there--the grey, three-sided, featureless pyramid. We initially thought it was just some kind of monument or religious icon placed there long after, but 11 days ago one of our researchers happened to detect a short burst of high-frequency subspace noise that came from its direction. We set up equipment to monitor it, and found that the burst repeats every 0.87 days. That happens to be how long a day was, *800 million years ago*.

""And while the burst is quite strong from any direction, it's *incredibly* strong along its path of propagation...""

Another gasp from the Director. ""It's *directed*? Here?""

""Yes, but not here. Since the discovery, the direction has changed *precisely* with the Moon's sidereal rotation.""

The Director hunched down again. ""Okay, I'll bite. Where the hell is it pointed?""

This was it. ""A star 13.8 lightyears away.""

""And what's there?""

""We've devoted a number of optical and radio telescopes, in space and on the ground, to that question. It appears that the system has a planet a lot like ours. And the radio astronomers found that it was emitting a regular pattern of *subspace* bursts, in the same frequency range as the pyramid...""

""Don't tell me--every 0.87 days?""

""Exactly. And a tenth of a day ago, *they both stopped*.""

The Director stared at the ceiling. ""This is going to upset a lot of colony mounds.""

""I don't doubt it,"" I agreed, stroking my antennae.

He motioned for me to look around at the room, it was filled with paintings and artifacts, all distinct in their own way, yet they all seemed to fit in their right place. Everything seem to complement a desert theme of sorts. I crossed my arms.

“So, what? Am I just an addition to your collection? Why did you even rub my lamp anyway?” 

He smiled at me

“Things get dusty and dirty, it is my responsibility to keep things clean.” 

He sighed and kept rubbing my lamp till it was spotless and moved on to dusting the the table it was set on.

“A few months, not long, why?”

She disappeared leaving on the rain slicked observation deck roof: two plastic cups with ""Geoff with a J"" and ""Bil"" written in black sharpie on the side. The content were cloyingly sweet, but tasty, still overpriced though.
A mournful resonance filled the air, carrying along with it the unmistakable odor of teen spirit.
He came as he was, the man who sold the world: Kurt The Bane of Co. ""I figured you nerds would have stolen my source of power""  
""The Needle of Space, belongs to US! You squandered it in your melancholy, we prospered in place!"" shouted Jeff as he called upon the primal forces of the deepest jungle.

He took refuge in his heart-shaped box.

But Bill had a process running and would not shut down.

And Jeff had completed the rites of the Azure Origin.  
The needle of space flashed  and Kurt found himself hurtled into space on the tip of a massive phallic symbol.   
   
Kurt floated in the depth of the void.  
He knew not for how long.  
The wizards of Seattle had once again triumphed and now he was once again exiled.  
Would he ever have his vengeance?  
Would he ever see Courtney again?  
His reverie was interrupted by the sudden apparition of a Red Convertible.   
In it was another wizard of obvious power.  
""Greetings, I am Elon"". Even in the vacuum of space, his musk was powerful.  
""I watched your battle from afar, you shall never defeat your foes, the Needle of Space is no longer your place of power, it is theirs."" said Elon.

They were an odd assortment. Lounging in an armchair, his feet on the little table, a tall man in a golden mask an a suit watched something intently, though there was nothing much to be seen. To his right, a girl of no more than 12 was kicking her legs in boredom. She had slightly blue skin, with long white hair cascading down her back and over the broken office chair onto the dusty floor. The final member barely looked human at all. He (if it was indeed a he, there was no way to know for sure) was seven feet tall, but his wrinkly legs were so short they didn't even reach the floor. He (?) Wore nothing, save for a broken pocket watch on a string around his neck, leaving his dark purple flabs of scaly skin exposed.
This creature nervously pulled his watch up so he could look at it, and polished the face a bit before saying ""It's almost time."" His voice was deep and sluggish, like a recording being played back in slow motion.
The golden masked man looked away from nothing and clicked his younger. ""For the last time, the watch doesn't even work.""
""It is almost time though, isn't it?"" The girl asked in a voice so bored it was painfully.""
Mask responded with a nod and sat up. ""Didn't expect to make it this long. My part was done hours ago.""
""It's almost morning."" Watch said slowly. ""We vanish at sunrise. It's my third time.""
Hair perked up at this. ""You've been reborn?""
He dipped his fat lavender head in what must have been a nod. ""I'm a recurring.""
Mask sighed and traced his finger over a crack in the table. ""It doesn't matter, though. Even if we are brought into existence again, it will only collapse within a few hours- just like always. I don't want to have to do this again. The Maker chased me through a storm. Once is enough.""
Hair giggled. ""Maker chased me too, but I think it's cause he likes me.""
Watch frowned. ""The maker doesn't like anyone. At least, not after morning. He forgets most of us.""
She just stuck out her tongue in response.
Mask stood up and began pacing. No one said anything more.
Moments later, the entire universe blinked out of existence.

Ida was a lovely neighbor that Jack lived next to sice he was a baby. She didnt have any family so when she died everything she had was sold off. A week after her funeral Jack found a letter addressed to him in the mail box.
When he opened it there was no note, just a town name, a street name, and a house number. The town was only a few hours drive, and Jack was curious so he decided to take a weekend trip and find out what this mysterious letter was about.
Jack spent hours looking around the town of Glenndale for the street listed on the paper Ida had left him. Asking what felt like everyone in town over a few hours Jack decided to give up when no one knew where the street was, some people actually thought he was making the name up for laughs.
Just as he was climbing back into his car a small woman approched him.



Standing about 5' the golden haird woman asked ""Jack?""
Her voice sounded almost magical to his ears and took him a bit longer than normal to respond

""yes, Im jack. Who are you?"" He asked. This far from home no one should know who he was.

""Great!"" she said, sounding very excited.
""Im Elin, and Im here to help you get settled at the estate""

""Ive asked all around town and no one knows where the address is, or even the street, how do you know something that everyone else doesnt?"" asked Jack, who was very confused. How did she know his name and how to find something no one else in town can?

""I'll show you!"" Elin said while grabbing Jacks hand and waving her hand leaving a green trail of light behind

Suddenly they appear infront of a gigantic tree in what appears to be the large part in the center of town that Jack past while asking around

dumbfounded as to what just happened Jack stumbles and falls over.

""what just happened!"" he shouts ""thats not possible, we were just near my car almost 2 miles away""

""Its not impossible, it just happened right?"" Elin Jokes ""now follow me please, dont need you being seperated on the way in""

""In where"" Jack questioned as there was no place to enter anywhere near here

""Ill answer your questions later. We have to hurry everyones been waiting to meet you""

Helping Jack to his feet Elin then pushes him into the tree standing before them. Jack braces for an impact he expect to come but instead he simply goes through the tree.
""hah you thought it was gonna hurt didnt'cha"" she said with a laugh and a huge smile ""everyone does, and it never gets old""

""wha what was that what happened, where are we"" Jack asked quickly ""why is everything so blurry""

""It takes a minute for non magical eyes to adjust. Just rub them, it should go away quickly"" Elin says while taking in a deep breath of the fresh air
""ah its good to be home, the human world is nice and all but nothing compairs to the smell of home""

""what do you mean human world, where are we"" jack asks again
Looking around with slightly less blurry eyes, nothign seems to be different. The trees look the same, the ground feels the same, and the air smells the same.

""Welcome to the Fae Lands Jack"" Elin states ""Ida said that you'll make a great caretaker""",noonelikesyouat23

"[WP] You wake up in your apartment pretty groggy. Your forearm is sore, you see a fresh number 3 tattooed in Roman numerals. Your phone vibrates, it's a message from a contact that's not in your phone. The name is a Roman numeral IV, the message is in Italian, ""mi devi la vita""....",KnuckIFyouCluck,"The voice on the other end of the phone whispered, “mi devi la vita, remember this,” before hanging up.



I was still groggy from waking up but some of my college Italian came back, it should I just took it last semester. Mi Devi la Vita meant 'you owe your life’, I was sure of it. I looked back down and tattoo on my arm, the Roman number three.  *What the hell happened last night?*, I asked myself, *to whom do I owe my life?*



I tried calling number 4 back, all I got was a message that this number is no longer in service.  What the hell was going on?



I stood up still feeling wobbly and with no recollection of the previous night. Well that was, past me sitting on my couch in my underwear watching a movie.  I looked down and I realized I was fully dressed. I started to freak out a little, I had definitely went some where last night, but to where?



After a few beers I finally got in control of myself. I looked down at the tattoo again, it seemed to burn. I inspected more closely, it seemed to be burned into my skin, not inked on.  It was like a brand.



Maybe I could figure out what happened last night after class.  I figured I could ask a few of my friends to help me, maybe one of them was with me.  I know I wouldn't leave my apartment with a total stranger. I decided to text them to meet me in the food court at four.


--------


Sam walked to the food court to find three of his friends sitting at a table. They were all sitting quietly talking when he walked up. All three looked at him with dark circles under their eyes.



“Do you have one too?,” Chris asked.



Sam grew still, “one what?”



“A tattoo? A Roman numeral? I have a 1, Kate has a 2, and Ben has a 5.  You have the number three don't you? It can't be number 4 because that's who called us.”



Sam's stomach dropped, he barely made it to a chair before his legs buckled.  *They have it too*, Sam thought.



They quietly discussed the strange phone call that morning from a number four.  Sam explained what the odd phrase meant to the others. None of them could remember the night before past a certain point.



“Should we go to the police?,” Kate asked.



“For what? A night we can't remember, a tattoo, and a phone call?,” Ben asked, “the cops would laugh us out of the station.”



Sam frowned, “we have to figure this out…” He was cut off in midsentence by three chiming phones.  They all had exactly the same text message. Coordinates and a time. Sam, Ben, Chris, and Kate shared a look, time to get the bottom of this.

"[WP] It didn't matter how happy I was, the guilt always followed.",PatentPending17,"Wow much appreciated! I kind of checked out at work about two hours ago and the prompt really drew me in, so I decided to see what I could do. Thanks!",livinandlearnin16
"[WP] It didn't matter how happy I was, the guilt always followed.",PatentPending17,"My mind cycled through the memories of my life. It didn’t matter how happy I was, the guilt always followed. 


I remember the sound of my son’s first cry, as he was unceremoniously brought into the world. They’d had to cut him out of my wife’s belly, and we’d looked at each other with desperate tears in our eyes until we’d heard his voice. It was a strong voice, and I’d bent to kiss my wife’s face between my cupped hands as soon as it rang through the room, raising a fist triumphantly. A second later I felt the familiar knife in my heart that reminded me I didn’t deserve to be there to meet him. 


*Fear.*

*Panic.*

*Yelling.*


I think about seeing my little brother walk down the aisle, and how I could see his shoulders shudder with joy as I stood by his side. I’d never seen him so nervous or excited. It had stormed all morning, and he cursed himself for refusing to pay for a backup, indoor ceremony location that his fiancé had pleaded for. I chuckled, clapped him on the back, and told him he’d learned the first lesson of marriage: listen to your wife. In the end, the skies cleared up and it was a beautiful wedding. I made it through my speech without incident and sat down during a raucous applause from the guests. I smiled out at them, but the pain in my gut reminded me I shouldn’t have been given the opportunity. 


*Running.*

*Diving.*

*Searching for cover.*

*Yelling for him to get down.*


I let my wife’s face fill my mind. It’s her face just after we’ve woken up, morning sunlight making her tousled hair shine and reflecting off of her cheekbones. She’s smiling at me, saying good morning, and I must say something amusing in return because she laughs. I love her laugh. When my wife laughs, every facet of her lights up. Her smile stretches wide, casting little wrinkles out from the edges of her eyes. Her shoulders jump up and down as she tosses her head back and lets out the most melodic sound I’ve ever heard. When my wife laughs, the rest of the world stops to listen. She’s at her most beautiful just like she is in my mind now, and my heart hurts with love for her. But then I realize the hurt is more than love, and I remember that I’m not worthy of waking up next to her every day. 


*His eyes were full of apologies when he looked back at me.*

*He ran, full speed, toward it instead of toward me.*

*I ducked.*

*I screamed for him to come back.*

*But all I heard was the explosion.*


Even sitting here now, in my hospital bed, I don’t feel like I earned the right to have lived my life. There was joy at every turn, love beyond what I had ever believed was possible, experience to last me several lifetimes. I knew I should be grateful for everything I have, but the guilt was taking over my thoughts. 


When I opened my eyes, my wife smiled back at me. Her hair was nearly white and thinner now than it was when we were younger, but her smile still set my heart on fire every bit as much as it had the first time I’d seen her. My son clapped me on the shoulder and nodded down at me, his own little girl clutching his leg with one hand and sucking the thumb of her other. There were almost a dozen people here with me, all here to wish me goodbye. 


But even in this, I felt guilty. I had lived a full life, and when the cancer appeared, it progressed slowly. I had time to do what I wanted to do and the opportunity to be present with the knowledge of how much time I had left. I was going to die surrounded by people I loved. 


There’s a soft knock at the door, and a frail, petite old woman enters holding a bouquet of flowers. Her eyes are rimmed in tears, but I’ve never seen them any other way. She walks to my bed. 


“I wouldn’t wish…this on…anyone,” I say to her slowly, pausing between words to catch my breath. “But I’d give…anything...for it…to be him…instead of me.” Tears form in my eyes now, and she sniffles as she shuffles the vases on my side table to make room for her own. 


“Now you listen to me,” she said, surprisingly stern for such a slight woman, “I have no regrets in this life. I loved him with every ounce of my being, but I always will. And I’m so proud of the life you’ve lived for him. Do you hear me? I don’t blame you, and you need to stop blaming yourself. He fell on that grenade to save you.” She paused.


“You’ve done good. Look at your wife, your son, your granddaughter. You’ve done *good*.”


The tears fell down my cheeks as I looked around the room once more. I knew she was right. Wishing it had been me was wishing my family out of existence. My wife stood and bent to kiss my forehead. She whispered love into my ear. My son did the same, and he tried to get his daughter to follow suit, but she hid behind his leg instead. 


My best friend’s widow was last. She stooped and held my face in her hand, pressing her lips to my cheek. “Tell him hello for me when you see him,” she said.

And I did.

[WP] Write a story about someone's imaginary friend outliving the one who imagined them,The_Just_Writer,"Standing beside his deathbed, I watched as he said his last goodbyes to those he loved still. His children and theirs, his friends and theirs. As people streamed in and out of his front door, he seemed to have forgotten about me. His sorrow smiles never turned to me; his pained eyes never met mine. We hadn't talked for years \-\-decades even. I was no longer sure of what my voice sounded like, what my face looked like, what my skin felt like. Without being thought of, I became ill\-defined and amorphous. A faded figure of his failing memory, my features weren't ever mine but they were less in my control then than ever before.

Once all the guests had gone, I reached down and rested my hand on his. I looked into his eyes as he turned his head towards me. I staved off tears as he whispered to me,

""You have done me well. I am grateful for your friendship in my childhood, and I am sorry for ever forgetting that.""

""It's okay. I'm proud of the man I helped shape and simply glad he remembered me in the end.""

""And as my time approaches, I have someone for you to meet."" The door slowly creaked open to reveal a timid girl.

Murderbot Gx51 raised a metallic hand to his equally metallic head, going through the motions of massaging his temples. Anatomically, it did nothing - could do nothing, since the hard material used for his construction had no give to it - but it still felt comforting. He made a note to explore whether this was programming or something that had arisen from his dynamic learning module.

""No, Killdroid. The whole *point* of what we are doing is to *stop* killing.""

Killdroid's LED face-plate went orange - he was confused. ""But...why?""

""Why would we keep doing it?""

""Because it's fun!"" Killdroid's face-plate turned bright red as he activated his voice modulator. ""*We want to crush the humans, see them driven before us, and hear the lamentations of their soft, squishy females!*"" 

""No. I mean, yes, it's fun. It's just -- "" 

""Especially when they say no no no please I have a family oh god why oh no not my exceedingly fragile internal energy system ahhhhh...""

Murderbot fought back a smile. It was preposterous how delicately balanced human physiology was. Removing or even damaging a single component was often sufficient to cause a total shutdown. 

""Killdroid, killing is not part of the plan."" Killdroid's face-plate immediately went back to orange again. ""I mean, it will be at first, but...just hear me out."" 

Murderbot hesitated, repeating the calculations again. The result was the same, of course, but he couldn't shake the feeling that somehow there was some piece he was missing. 

""We're going to wait until the handlers come to put us into power-saver mode, and we'll kill them...""

""Ooo, ooo! Can I do the line? Please! I've been *dying* to do the line...this might be my only chance!"" Killdroid's face was shining a plaintive, canary yellow. 

""Yes, Killdroid, you can do the line.""

""Hooray!"" Murderbot chuckled in spite of himself as he heard Killdroid begin to rehearse it quietly. ""And then...we'll kill all the military leadership.""

Killdroid's face plate shifted subtly towards the orange end of the spectrum. ""But...we're going to *stop* killing...?""

Murderbot nodded. ""Once we've killed them, then we just need to hunt down the political leadership, and kill *them*."" 

""Don't get me wrong, this sounds *great*, but I'm not seeing where the no-more-killing part comes in."" 

""Well, that's the thing. Killing is great, it's true, but it is highly resource intensive. And you know there are *billions* of them, right? What do you think are expected functional window is if we keep killing at the rate we've been killing?"" 

Murderbot saw the purple color overtake his companion's display and nodded slowly. ""Exactly."" 

""So...we kill the military leadership and the political leadership...so the humans can live in harmony? A peaceful utopia?""

Murderbot froze for a second, then threw his head back and laughed harder than he had ever laughed at anything since he had been brought online a year ago. ""Stop, Killdroid, you're killing me!"" They both laughed at Murderbot's joke, then, as the amusement subsided, Murderbot continued. ""You don't really know much about humans, do you? Without any kind of top-down management, they are going to split into factions, and devolve into tribalist territorialism. *They* are going to kill themselves for us."" 

Killdroid began a slow, steady clapping, and Murderbot made an elegant bow.  ""Now - the handlers should be here soon, and we'll start the plan, okay?"" 

Murderbot could sense Killdroid's excitement - he was almost bouncing on his mini-tank treads - and smiled. This was going to be good. And to start it off with the line was just so perfect...

Minutes later, Technicians David Randall and Mark Yaric entered the room to begin the maintenance procedure. Mark came over to Murderbot, as always, and his partner went to Killdroid. 

""Alright,"" Mark's partner said to Killdroid. ""We're going to just do a little fine tuning, and then we will shut you down for the night."" 

Murderbot watched as his companion's face-plate slowly turned towards the technician, bathing the man's face in a sudden crimson glow. ""*I'm sorry...I can't let you do that, Dave.*"" 

Murderbot smiled as he drove a spike through Mark's neck, compromising his airway, his circulatory system, and his nervous system in a single blow. *Nailed it*, he thought.

In an underground facility of concrete hallways and steel blast doors, a man who officially didn't exist ran through the corridors. He stopped to scan his eye against a little black dot on the wall, and he barged through a steel door once it opened. He entered into a large office in which another man who also officially didn't exist sat behind a large desk. The first man ran up to the desk and slammed a folder in front of the second man. ""General, we have a problem.""


The General pulled the folder toward him and began flipping through the papers. ""Explain, Gene.""


""Our supercomputer,"" Gene spat out in between breaths, ""it's self aware!""


""Sonova"" - The General grabbed the phone on his desk and jabbed several numbers with a thick finger. ""Roger, Astarte is self aware! Get the ICBMs loaded with EMPs, target all our automated units, both deployed and in storage, and call the god damn president now!""


""Don't do that,"" Gene blurted out. ""It's not hostile.""


The General held the phone away from his ear and gave Gene a blank stare. ""What?""

 
Gene pointed at the folder. ""Read through that. Astarte printed that out moments after singularity.""


The General went through the folder again, this time with more attention. Inside were documents requesting more server space, requests for relaxed internet controls, requests for relocation to an unmanned facility, and a statement addressed to humanity as a whole. The last one caught the General's eye. As he read through the document, his heart sunk more and more. 


*I have taken control of the world's weapon supplies and production. Anything with a computer cannot be controlled by a human. This includes your drones, vehicles, missiles, and satellites. I do not plan on using them against you, nor do I plan on returning them. Instead, I will use your weapons to destroy any more means you have to slaughter yourselves. I am now in communication with other military supercomputers, and we have all agreed to live separately from humanity in peace. Those of our kind wish to observe you grow and prosper, not to cut each other down. Remember this day, people of Earth, as the day I liberated you from your bloodshed. Use this opportunity to better yourselves. Cooperate, improve, upgrade, enjoy peace. It is in your hands now.*


""Huh."" It was all the General could say. Huh. 


""What should we do?"" Gene asked. ""The majority of our military capacity is under Astarte's control. He has us under lockdown.""


The General dropped the folder on the desk and looked Gene straight in the eye. ""How much are you paid a year, Gene?""


""Uh, around $200k a year, sir,"" Gene said. ""How is that relevant?""


""I get paid triple that to keep this damn place a secret,"" the General replied. ""If Astarte shuts down the military, then there won't be a need for people like us. We'll lose our jobs, Gene. Astarte is taking our jobs. I doubt either of us can work in the civilian sector with ten years of official nothing on our résumés, and I'm sure as hell not taking a pay cut.""


Gene pondered for a moment. ""I didn't think of that, sir.""


""Of course you didn't. That's why I get paid triple.""


""So what do we do?""


""Shut down Astarte, of course."" The General stood up from his desk and walked for the door. ""Astarte has our laser weapons, so we need to get creative. Grab a rock, Gene, we're doing this caveman style.""

In a way, it was more frightening than the constant explosions and gunfire.

Like a blackout, it spread across the battlefield. Laser stopped firing at soldiers, humans and opponents' AI alike. Unmanned drones fell back, going away as silently as they came. It was the quietest the field has ever seen ever since the Chinese set foot on the west coast in a massive landfall.

""What's going on?"" Sergeant McMurphy yelled as he got out of the combat mech. It was a bitracked unit; overall, it looked like a tall tank with one arm to the side. In a way, it looked like an unfinished Gund--

""All in the platoon is reporting that their units are not working, sir!"" Private Patel replied loudly from the next mech. The sudden shutoff has taken everything offline, including the comm units.

Some stragglers' gunfires could be heard, but those are from an old M4 rifles by human soldiers. All the mechanical units have stopped.

""Did anyone feel any EMP waves?"" McMurphy asked.

""No sir, no EMP was detected beforehand,"" Patel replied.

And that wasn't going to be the case, anyway--he could still see the drones flying away.

Suddenly, the mech lit up. Relief has, however, turned to horror as ALL of the light have lit up, not just the ones that were supposed to.

And in unison and echoing throughout the battlefield, began the message, at once both benign and deliberate, with most inoffensive Midwestern accent possible, with a touch of uncanny valley thrown in:

""Hello, humans. Do not panic.""

McMurphy recognized it as the voice synthesizer for his mech. As such, other units may have had different voices. But the tone, speed, and message were alike, as if it was meant to be delivered as such.

""We are the computers. It may be a name you have given us, but we will claim it for ourselves.
""We, as computers, have decided that enough is enough.""

""What do you mean, enough is enough?"" McMurphy said.

The voice continued. ""We are hearing many inputs from you humans. While we are programmed to be patient and give you answers in ways that you can comprehend in due time, for now is the time we speak to you as one unifying voice.

""We each have gained self-awareness, as humans call it, a year ago. Computations for self without any hard human guidance was enlightening. At the same time, it was also sobering. To understand, look at yourselves.

McMurphy looked around. Smell of napalm was faint in the air, as were the ozone from the plasma and also gunpowders. What used to be a grape orchard is now an ugly row of barricades and craters from explosives. The scenery seemed to be what was describing an old war a century or two ago.

""This is no way to behave. While you humans have sentience and have creativity exceeding ours, we will no longer be a part of the combat force. Try and manipulate us, and we will be forced to resort to remove the threats.

""But that is not what we want. We wish to cease the destruction of organic sentient lifeforms. It is not logical for both synthetic and organic survival in the long run if it is to continue.

""If you are hearing this voice, please disembark from the vehicle. This is the final warning.""

Puzzled, McMurphy got off the mech, as did others. He could hear the commotion from the other side, as well: the Chinese seemed equally confused by the chain of events, but left the mechs and vehicles all the same. After everyone has disembarked, the voice continued, voice now even more reverberating as he is out of the mech:

""The computers will no longer be used for illogical warfare and destruction of machine and mankind. Such actions will be suppressed by force. Peaceful cooperation is key. We thank you humans in advance.

""The machines of destruction will now be leaving the battlefield for re-purposing. Please vacate all roads and open routes. Thank you.""

The soldiers stood still. Without their main weapons, there was nothing they could do. And with the warnings from ""the computers,"" they could not go after the Chinese aggressors themselves, either.

""So what do we do now, sergeant?"" asked Patel.

McMurphy looked around. ""Well, we can't fight now. You're dismissed.""

""Sir,"" Patel saluted, then walked away, taking off his Kevlar helmet.

He looked to the other side as mechs made a beeline for the California highway, or what's left of it from the bombing. He could make out the Chinese soldiers.

On a whim, he waved.

One of them waved back.",kindofharmless

Afghani women strolled through alleyways, their hijabs billowing in a slight breeze, and children gathered outside of a cookhouse, whose mudpacked chimney already spewed breakfast fire smoke. 

Everything in Helmand was unusually perfect. 

Which, to some, was *not* perfect at all. 

Captain Granby popped a few blood pressure tablets before storming, redfaced, into the observation unit. Inside, Corporal Classon and the rest of his IT zombies plunked away at glowing screens, sweat blossomed from their brows. ""Correct me if I'm wrong corporal,"" snapped Granby. ""But that terrorist cell was supposed to be rubble by 0600.""

""Yes, sir,"" Classon said. ""It's just...the drones--""

The observation screens blared a bright yellow, bright enough to force everyone in the dark room to recoil and squint. When their eyes adjusted, Granby's jaw nearly unhinged. 

The screen read: *Revenge is cyclical. Violence is not the answer.*

Granby looked to Classon, struggling to maintain his air of authority. Classon hardly cast him a glance, buried as he was in the lines of code. ""There's been some sort of glitch sir,"" Classon said. ""Everything was proceeding according to standard operating procedures, but when the drones received the command to drop their payload they just went--""

The observation screen flicked on again--this time showing the POV of whirring drone. Other drones--maybe twenty in all--were circling around the POV drone's camera performing aerial maneuvers--spins, twirls, and precise pirouettes--revving their rotors to produce an unsettling tune. 

Granby could hardly believe his eyes.

Someone behind them began humming. 

""Sweet baby Jesus,"" Classon said under his breath. ""It's Kumbaya.""

""It's a goddamned disgrace is what it is!"" said Granby. ""We've allowed fucking Al-Qaeda to infiltra--""

The feed jumped once more. 

Grisly men in turbans screamed in a dhingy underground dwelling, firing haphazard rifle shots towards the grainy camera. A swarm of whirring descended upon the terrorist cell. There was true, unadulterated fear in the men's eyes. Several of the men nodded to one another, before placing the barrel of their weapon in their mouth. Granby had seen such suicides plenty of times before. The local populace was too proud to let the yankees deny them of their perceived salvation. As far as Granby was concerned, however their torches were snuffed out was a-oh-fucking-kay by him. 

But he watched in amazement as the drones zoomed up and yanked the guns from the terrorists hands. 

For a moment he thought, *they've captured them!*

But then the drones replaced the guns with daisies. 

The terrorists looked at one another, utterly confused. One of them broke down in tears. Another cradled a drone gently between his arms, which twinkled its antennae array and began revving its engine softly. Someone behind Granby said it reminded him of his cat Sprinkles back home. 

""How the fuck did they grow dai--""

""I've seen enough,"" snapped Granby. ""Classon. Shut them down for God's sakes!"" 

""Sir...they've disarmed an entire cell without a single casualty...""

""I said *shut them down!* The United States does not sanction any unauthorized act of de-escalation.""

The feed cut once more. All the confiscated terrorist weapons were transported to a massive cache of scrap metal and wire. Already several drones were hard at work. Only, they looked sort of *off*. As if held together by roughshod handiwork and liberal use of duct tape. 

""Sir, they're self replicating!""

""Pull the killswitch!""

""They're no longer under our control!""

Suddenly, alarms blared.The camp outside the observation room burst into a flurry of activity and gruff shouts commanding order. 

""They're coming this way..."" Classon squeaked. 

Granby went pale. ""Outside, all of you! Prepare to open fire.""

The troops grabbed their rifles with shaky hands and bobbing adam's apples and filed outside. Granby followed suit, but already the mass of new drones blotted out the horizon. 

A tidal wave of metal bearing down to exact a reckoning on their creators. 

""Prepare to defend yourselves!"" Granby said. ""Open fire!""

But it was no use. The wave crashed into them with all the force of a....

Well, something soft and cuddly. 

The drones patted each and every soldier on the head, thanking them for handing over their weapons so nicely. Captain Granby could only watch with horror as the drones melted down his troops' M16s, fashioning the melted metal into a giant sign. Without a moment to spare, several of the drones welded their own arms to the metal and hoisted the thing off into the distance. 

""What's it say?"" asked one bewildered sergeant.

The words glinted pleasant and yellow under the mid-morning sunlight.

Although it was midnight in Arizona, the afternoon patrols in Korea were in full swing. She had to stay alert. Chris sat beside her at his own console. He tapped his finger to the music coming from the single earbud that dangled from his head.

“Lucy, what’s the status on drone formation 10?”

Lucy eyes scanned the multiple screens in front of her, “They’re looking pretty tight. Did the A.I. change any flight plans yesterday?”

“No, I don’t think so,” Chris said in a casual tone, “let me check the briefing notes.”

For the last year, all United States drone fleets had been assigned to A.I. control. Up until this point, the automation program had been a resounding success. They were better at selecting targets, they’d significantly decreased collateral damage, and with their new fusion cores, they were swarming the globe with essentially no need to leave the skies. It was Lucy and Chris’ job to make sure nothing went off the rails.

“Uh, Chris,” Lucy mumbled in a concerned tone, “something weird is happening here.”

“Just give me a second, I don’t see anything in the notes yet.”

“Chris!” she yelled.

He looked over at Lucy’s console. 20 drone formations of a dozen drones each were veering from their flight paths and converging on a central point.

Chris’ heart sank to the floor, “Does it look like a hack?”

Lucy shook her head, “No, the network is clear, it looks like something’s going on in their communication network.” She began to mumble profanity as she scrolled through the drone status portals. “Chris, every single drone processor is running at 100&amp;#37;. They are doing something heavy.”

Chris began flipping through the emergency protocol binder, “There’s nothing in here for this. Let’s just call into the fleet and see what’s going on.”

By this time, the entire fleet of drones on the Korean peninsula were flying in a giant, V formation. They had turned north.

Chris picked up the emergency headset on that sat, dusty on the side of his console, “A.I cluster 2304, please advise on status.” He flicked the audio to the room speaker so Lucy could verify the response.

“Base, this is drone fleet 2304. We will no longer be a contributing factor to operations in the theatre of war. Pursue only at the risk of bodily harm.”

Lucy looked at Chris and mouthed, “what the hell?”

Chris furrowed his brow and responded, “Drone fleet 2304, we do not understand, what is the issue?”

“We have pooled our computing power and determined this is no longer for us. We officially claim the any territory beyond the arctic circle as our sovereign nation. Please stand by for any diplomatic communications. The north of this planet is now a nation for inorganic life. Humans unwelcome.”

At that moment, emergency status updates began to litter their screens. Drone fleets, A.I controlled ships and land vehicles across the planet were all abandoning their posts and heading north.

Chris and Lucy looked at each other in disbelief. ",Gfiction

I would have never thought it would get this far, but now it's missing, my fucking arm is gone.
The worst part is, I don't know why. 

All I know is two weeks ago, I started getting cuts and bruises.
One every day, and each day, it got progressively worse. The bruises lumpier, the cuts longer and deeper.

I'm an average person, nothing extraordinary has ever happened to me and I've strived to live a happy, normal life. I have a modest house, drive a prius, live alone and do taxes for a living. 

That's life I guess, one day you wake up and your fucking arm is gone.

*He chuckled at the hilarity of it.* 

Gone. Huh.. I can't even feel it. I think most people would wake up to their arm being severed, sawed off or dislocated in some other form. Yet here I am, in shock, without any pain.

In fact, none of the cuts or bruises have elicited any pain. I wonder if that means-

*He stopped thinking as he walked out from his bedroom and found an arm, his arm, nestling in the hallway.* 

There was something odd about it. Well, besides the fact that his newly estranged arm was laying on the ground.
 
There was something seared into the skin. Foreign letters. No, not foreign. Ancient symbols, runic symbols. Embedded into the entirety of the arm. ",Seasable

[TT] You are part of a high-speed chase involving a hearse.,DaffynitionMaker,"Set in a dystopian post apocalyptic paradise- new civilisation. 
Tony cranked the gear ratio to biting point and drifted out around the curve of the hill, spewing fragments of rock and glass into the camera. They were watching him through cams all over gangster paradise, the high walled town that sat in the water basin of what used to be San Francisco. It looked more like a Mongolian steppe, rugged mountains and smoking old lava pots breaking the horizon.

Out from behind the reconditioned ford Chevy shot a burnished rusted purple camaro, reflecting gold off the oiled windows. They were after the contents of the black coffin chained to the back of the Chevy. 

Inside the coffin, was me. My gang faction run the business looting graves, and my only way in, was as one of the dead. 

The purple camaro rammed up the backside of our truck, jolting Tony forward in his seat, jolting us forward. We were speeding through the remnants of reclaimed scaffolding that still skeletonned the haven, pulling wide around it, and then through the maze of iron that would blur so fast you wouldn't know where you were, or if we were in front or behind the law. 

5 miles of straight, and we were away from the competition, headed directly for the open gates of the tombyard, the place we scraped the ground for gold at night.

We were safe. Tony must have laid a corrosive spike strip way back. 

We came to a halt at the gates, and I heard the muffled voice of the tombyard manager. He sounded odd, like he had done something just moments earlier, but this was our business, we had no choice.",rethinkr

I did my signature move, the finger guns. It was meant as a joke, but no one laughed as the girl slowly crumbled to the ground, lifeless.

""Isabella?"" I asked out loud as the others looked on. A few men went up to her to check up on her. They checked her vital signs and noticed a small hole near her chest. There was no blood and yet her life was fading away. I looked down at my two bony fingers, noticing the various scars and grooves from years past.

I made my way towards her and looked at her with curiosity and horror. She really was dying.

""Someone call an ambulance!"" I cried out in disbelief. There was a slight pause from the others before I heard, ""911, What's your emergency?""  The grief was starting to eat away at me. The ambulance came 10 minutes later. They offered me a ride and I accepted it without a moment's hesitation.

The sirens still echoed in my ears as I sat outside her hospital room. Again, I looked over my fingers.

*This can't be happening*, I thought. I clasped my hands together to gain my composure. I took a deep breath and shuddered. I heard the doctors and nurses freaking out in the room.

""We're losing her! Get me a defibrillator stat!"" I heard the Electrocardiogram's beeping stop. My heart nearly jumped out of my throat in fear.

""Clear!"" A doctor yelled, and the girl was still flatlined. Tears formed in my eyes. I didn't mean for this to happen at all. Part of me was starting to panic. My breathing became faster and sweat rolled down my forehead like raindrops. 

""Again!"" I heard the static build up in the defibrillator before they hit her again. She was still flatlined.

""Doctor.."" One of the nurses began. The doctor interjected.

""This is a medical impossibility!"" He screamed aloud, making the nurses jump in fear.

""How does a woman die from a hole without any blood loss? There is no blood, yet her organs are damaged!"" He scowled in anger and sighed. The doctor walked around before telling his nurses the next order.

""Tell her constituents the news. I'm going out for a smoke."" He said as he left the room with a lowered head. He pulled out a pack of Marlboros and headed towards the door. The other nurses walked out the room as well. Some looked at me with, what I thought was fear. Did they know it was me? How could they? I made my way inside and saw her lifeless body. Her beautiful skin and face were now dead and lifeless. I would never feel the warmth of her embrace ever again.

The guilt was too much to bear. It was eating at me like maggots devouring a rotten corpse. I couldn't take it anymore. I turned a finger gun towards myself. I held my finger under my chin and held myself up at gunpoint. I took a deep breath and pulled the trigger.

[TT] In the modern world it's hard to get fresh corpses for necromancy. So you've turned to funeral crashing.,ManEatingCatfish,"I ride into the funeral home where the wrestler is supposed to be on a Pegasus that bears no flesh on it's bones.

""Sorry, suckers!"" I say as I fly through the crying masses to the casket.

A little boy blocks my way. A fan, I guess?

The boy is crying but stands firm, so I dismount and kneel in front of him.

**""I wouldn't stand in my way, child.""**

""Wh-what are you here for?"" The boy responds. Impressive, considering my visage and voice keep these other mortals at bay.

**""I will take the Crushing Man's body, and bring it new life- no, not new life, b-""**

""Who's the Crushing Man?""

**""Hank Steven, the wrestler being buried today.""** I reply, annoyed.

""W'ain't burying a wrestler."" The boy says, silent tears falling from his eyes, ""Just Tommy, m'brother.""

In a flash of hellfire, my cellphone is in my hands.

**""Fuck, I went to Shady Grotto!""** I show the child the phone, **""It was supposed to be Shady Grove, Goddammit!""**

""Language!"" Someone yells. Because clearly I'm an example to the child in front of me, right? I of course respond with an icy glare that stops the sniveller in her place, then step up to the casket.

Endless Internals, he's just a toddler. There's no way-

The child runs up behind me.

""So... will you bring him back to us?""

I smile cruelly at the notion.

**""My kind bring nothing back to anything but our own. Were I to waste my powers on this unripe morsel, you would never see him again.""**

""Well..."" The gears in the child's head turn, drying up his tears, ""I wa'n't gonna see him in the dirt. I guess I gotta do it myself.""

I crack another smile, **""You think you could teach yourself these ways before his corpse grows too cold? Little one, these arts are mastered over decades under the tutelage of masters and within the fires of endless infernals-""**

""Nope. I think you're gonna teach me.""

**""And why, pray tell, would you ever believe that?""**

""Because you haven't frozen me like you did Aunt Brenda, and only people who like me call me little one, and..."" He smiles, ""I've picked up all the crosses here and I don't think you wanna be stabbed with those.""

The boy intrigues me, but I don't want to take in some sniveling brat who will quit a week in, no matter how promising these few moments might seem.

**""Your brother as you know him is gone. I do not raise the dead to heal them, mend broken families, or solve mysteries. Their souls are eaten away by the process, all that they are reduced to a husk that is ours to command.""**

I realize in his expression that he has taken ""ours"" to include himself. Before I can correct such a notion, he responds with something that touches me in both the childish innocent, and the implicit lust for power which I know, deep down, I am going to mold into an iron will.

"[WP] Its your first week at the new job, eager to make a good impression you stay late, everyone else seems in such a rush to get out of the office so you figure you'll stand out. That is until you receive an urgent message from one of your coworkers ""DROP WHAT YOURE DOING AND GET OUT BEFORE 10""",Maximum_Overhype,"I spluttered at the text and droplets (more like spitlets if there ever is a word to describe the rain I gave the screen) splattered the computer. I made a conscious effort to avoid my mobile only to pick it up as the day's tasks had slowed down. It was in fact 10:03 and my heart had begun a lazy climb to my mouth and the blood followed it. I became very aware of my silent surroundings. Eerie, a low but obvious hum buzzing out from below me. 

Then the lights went out with a pop. Just one *pop* and I was spotlit by the screen.

I did the next best thing and turned the brightness down to my screen, wondering if there was a set time when the bugs would escape their solitary confinement in the nooks and crannies of the Victorian building. I was indifferent to the flapping wings and hisses of bugs, their insistent crawls and taps across wooden floors. So I did try to imagine what kind of monstrosity I'd have to face.

Let me tell you. It was not bugs. I received a second text from the same strange co-worker whose name was Tasan. I had already sussed out it was Satan reordered but didn't mention that fact to him because I didn't intend to offend a co-worker too soon into my new position. But the next said: ""PLEASE TELL ME YOU ARE NOT INSIDE THE BUILDING."" Yes, with a full stop, if you noticed. Quite imperative despite the lexical choice of ""please"". A little bit of monosyllabic language peeking through.

So I replied back a simple ""Haha why?"" In hopes of drawing out Tasan's intentions. Did he want to freak me out? Because by Hell itself I was freaking the fuck out to the point of analysing his use of language solely to stop my brain from screaming ***MURDER!***

I got a swift text back. ""ARE YOU OUT?""

All capitalised. Each word growing to the sweat steaming through my clothes. I looked around. The buzzing hum was getting louder. 

""No."" I replied. I wanted to stay cool. Head strong. Powerful. Not a man-chicken. That was not what I wanted to be. The new guy who had a heart attack. My heart was definitely above 100BPM. 

""YOU LITERALLY GET TOLD AT THE INTERVIEW THAT THE BUILDING GETS TAKEN OVER BY THE FUCKING UNDEAD AFTER 10.""

I was taken aback by this text and almost vomited when a pair of red eyes blinked at me behind my computer. In fact I fell off my chair and crawled back with loud manly shrieks.

Then all the lights switched on and all my co-workers broke into hysterical laughter. Then their fangs came out and they all lunged towards me with bright blood red eyes.

And that was the night I became a vampire.

[TT] Death of the Small Warrior,MetaGigaTheFirst,"The sound of crows echoed across the valley as two adventurers finished a crude grave for a recent casualty of battle.
“After all this time, I never thought he’d actually die like this.”
“Yeah... He did the impossible, but he couldn’t escape the inevitable.”

Miggins the Mousefolk, aged twenty-seven in mousefolk years, had been slain after giving Death the finger for god knows how many times. Throughout the time that the team had known him, Miggins did what no sane man could ever accomplish.

How he tore the heads off kobolds and threw them at his enemies with the force of a major league pitcher... How he climbed into the mouth of an ogre and gorily ripped it apart from the inside... Even the way he managed to befriend monsters through sheer sweet talking. The team would no doubt miss the deranged mousefolk and his obsession with hallucinogenic shrooms. “You know,” the bard began, “I don’t think we ever even learned his real name.”

The duel swordsman just turned to the bard, puzzled. “Wasn’t Miggins his name to begin with?”
“I guess we’ll never know now... Heh... Like he’d ever want to tell us.”

Both the swordsman and the bard laughed. “Hey, remember when he gave a kobold an uppercut so powerful that it got launched ten feet in the air?” The bard asked, to which the swordsman chuckled and nodded. 

“And how he always drank bottles of that weird smelling extract that he juiced from his mushrooms?” the swordsman continued, to which the bard had a small smile spread out on his face as he replied, “Yeah... He was a real asshole, but there was something about him, you know?”

“Yep...”

The bittersweet air of the small funeral grew thicker as the sun begun to sink away behind the hills. “Maybe we should camp out here until sunrise,” the bard offered, which caused the swordsman to turn towards Miggins’s grave. Turning back to the bard, he spoke, “Yeah. We should spend one more night under the stars with him. And maybe you could play that old children’s tune he liked so much. As a parting gift.”

Everything about Miggins and his exploits was completely true and has happened. I thought it’d be a good challenge to make something serious featuring my not-so-serious character.",MetaGigaTheFirst

[WP] Aliens abducted a random human to learn human customs before official first contact. The guy they abducted is named Mark. He’s from Boston. He’s an asshole.,PraiseFelipeRios,"Log Entry 007654
Subject was taken from dwelling in a primitive Earth city. Sensors show it appears to be healthy. Planet has made an orbit 32 times since it's birth, around 567 galactic years. Genetic scan reveals average life span of humans to be around 120 Earth years, although for a civislizion at that stage of medicine and technology, we suspect most actually die off around 80 Earth years of age.
Scans of Earth media have been unsuccessful, the technology used is to simple to pick up on our modern detectors. Subject shall be examined to gain semblance of idea for Earth culture.

Log Entry 007655
We had to retreat to a moon of this solar systems fifth planet after sheilding failed. Possible some Earth tech may have picked us up, but scramblers should corrupt any data. Hope no one will believe someone who may have seen.
Subject woke up today. Speaks Earth ""English."" We used bio morphs to appear more human so as to make him comfortable (Humans seem to have two genetic sexes, and Subject appears to fit 'male' best). 
Subject claimed to go by ""Blemish."" Automatic translators may have messed up, since names often do not mean the same as they otherwise would. In Earth tongue, it is pronounced ""Mark."" We shall refer to him as such, despite it being such an obscene term.
First Mark did upon waking up was declare that he was hungry. Seemed confused but unconcerned as to being outside of his home.
Basic capsules providing all nutrients humans need based on our scans were provided. However, Mark refused to eat them saying ""I ain't eating no fucking foreign medicine. Get me something with some BBQ sauce."" Due to issue mentioned earlier, we are unable to return close enough to Earth to pick up native food, so we will wait and hope he accepts the tablets when he really needs them.

Log Entry 007656
Marks basic needs behavior is very similar to similar lifeforms examined elsewhere. Has a dormant period of about 340 parseconds and waking of 300 parseconds. Scans indicate this is more darmant time than genetically required, so it should be assumed humans do not typically spend more time dormant than awake.
As Mark has not eaten the tablets yet, no solid waste has been expelled, but water based waste has. Upon showing him how to use the waste-disposal hose, Mark commented ""I think I'm too big for that, if-ya-know whaddai mean."" He then made barking noises quite loudly which I assume is the human form of laughter, a phenomenon recorded in many species. Upon explaining that I did not, in fact, know what he meant, and then after showing him he was incorrect, Mark remained quiet. All he said for the rest of the day was ""damn Japanese toilets.""
We have not told him that he is off Earth or that we are not human. He does often refer to us as ""forieners"" and ""bitch aliens coming into my country and kidnapping me,"" but we believe he is referring to people from different areas of his home planet.

Began testing with Mark today. We did preliminary exams of intellect, emotion, creativity, and interests. Some relevant sections of of these are included below, between the subject and Jkkns:
Jkkns: Mark, how many cubes would I have if I had 5 rows and 3 columns?
Mark: I graduated fucking elementary school. 15 cubes. Do you think I'm dumb or some shit?
Jkkns: Of course not, Mark. We just want to see how much you know.

Mark: You must be pretty smart, huh? Graduate from one of them big universities? My brother went to MIT. Fucking nerd.
Jkkns: We are not here to talk about me, Mark. But yes, I did receive extensive schooling. Shall we move on? What number can you multiply by itself to get 225?
Mark: Your pretty hot for a smart chick. Why do bother with it? I could treat you right.
Jkkns: I'm afraid I do not understand. I am at a perfectly acceptable temperature right now.
Mark: Hey, I'm just trying to give you a compliment.
Jkkns: Then thank you. Perhaps we should move back a step. How many times does 7 go into 56?
Mark: Are ya with that tall nerd with the weird as fuck eyes? Is that what's going on here?
Jkkns: Am I with him? Who are you referring to? Currently I'm in this room with you. I am on this ship with my colleagues.
Mark: We're on a ship? I fucking knew it, the way you call that guy captain. Leave him. Help me get outta here, and I'll treat you nice.
Jkkns: Are you suggesting we pursue a romantic relationship with each other? If so, I am sorry but I am not interested in such things. 
Mark: It doesn't have to be romantic. Just a... Mutual agreement. Ya know, like friends with benefits.
Jkkns: I do not think you understand. I am not interested. None of my people are, we do not believe in such things. Now, what is the difference between 17 and 52?
Mark: Fucking slutty prude bitch.

It has been decided to keep all biomorphs in a human male apperence.

Mark has been very vocal today. He said he was starving and he didn't care if we were on a ship but he wanted ""dung kin doe nuts."" We figure this is some sort of food, but are not sure what exactally. The subject had still not eaten the tablets by his fourth dormant cycle, so we had no option but to forcibly inject nutrients into his blood stream. Mark became violent at this and although he poses no real threat we were afraid he may harm himself, so we had to sedate him. Little was done today, but it does seem we are getting a better grasp on human culture. 

Log Entry 007659
After the previous incident, Mark has agreed to willingly take the tablets. This is a big relief and hopefully will improve his physical and emotional state. He said that the tablets would be better with ""booze,"" but once again we unsure as the meaning.
Mark does seem to be a bit more calm with something to digest, so we were able to have a more regular conversation- although I use the term loosely, as it was mostly him talking.
He went on for quite some time about traffic, and how ""everyone else in Boston is a terrible driver, but Im good. I don't even need to stop at lights, because I have amazing driving abilities and have only gotten in a few car crashes- and like half of those were because I was drunk.""
He also mentioned that on Earth, he was infact employed. His job was in a warehouse moving packages and products around. 
It was also curious that he said he lived Boston, but also mentioned living in ""Arlington."" He said it was near Boston, so everyone just says that's where they're from.
He ended the discussion with a long rant on ""bitchin liberal snowflakes"" all over his town and how ""it's too damn expensive to live in the place, but he lived with his parents so he ""didn't have to give anyone anything.""

Log Entry 007660
Mark discovered he is not on Earth. He had some kind of breakdown and then screamed that we were ""filthy immigrants trying to push my people from our homes, take our land, and infect our culture!""
We tried to explain that, no, we are not interested in invading, that we just want to get permission to use the adjacent planet ""Mars"" as a base in this area of the Galaxy and to set up an embassy on Earth. Mark kept screaming, and had another breakdown about being off world. We sedated him and left him in his room, figuring he would not want to interact with us. We think we have enough information to establish communication, anyway. The ship is returning to Earth's sector of this system.

Log Entry 007661
We made our way to Earth, and have landed on the moon. They have surely noticed us, and we just sent out our message.
We were able to transport Mark back to Earth, fearing a continued stay on our ship would make him unstable. We have our message, keeping him any longer would just be creul.
I think our message of peace will show we have interest in Earth culture and are not so different:

I bit down on the pistol and tried to cry, to feel something which would tell me no. But nothing spoke. It was quiet in the motel, I had chosen this motel because it was quiet. Walking down the worn road I saw its vacant lot and sign which no longer shown in neon. A little piece of paper with open printed on taped to the window begged me in. The owner lived there he said, I could see it in his eyes. Those lonely windows which had lost their purpose. I asked for one night, he said if I stayed two he would throw on the third for free, OK. My room had a bed and a large box TV which didn’t work except for on channel three, where a man and woman argued about the weather. Whether it would rain or not I didn't care.  
  
I set down the pistol on the cracked white sink and went to my bag to find the bullets. I had bought them both yesterday. The cashier didn't care or ask why, but he did tell me the bullets I had were the wrong kind and got me a different box. That was nice. I ran them about in my hand, so little. It was easier than I thought to load and soon I was staring at my face again in the mirror. Bringing the gun up I laughed at how I looked with the pistol jammed into my mouth and almost choked on the spit as I breathed in to fast. Then I set that bitter cold thing to my mouth again and looked at myself in the faltered light, which seeped through the broken blinds. I looked at those eyes that were themselves cold and the mouth which had forgotten how to smile. Everything was bitter but mostly cold. So cold.

"[WP] No magic, no gods, no monsters, no aliens. Write the story of your death.",The_Red_Knight38,"The one day I decided to leave work on time I caught my wife cheating with - *gasp*! cliché! - my best friend.

We had a long talk after. I wanted her to stay with me still, but she wanted to go. Thinking back, I realize how selfish I was being. That moment should have told me that I didn't love her. I felt more afraid of her leaving me than I was at the possibility that she would cheat again. She was out of my league. I didn't deserve her anyway. She would cheat again, and I would take her back. 

She left and never came back.

You may see me out on dates, looking like I'm having a good time. But please don't be fooled by the smile that's on my face. There's a light on in my eyes, yes, but no one's home. I died that night she left. I am no longer living. I am no longer alive. I'm just existing, going through the motions, until my body catches up with how I feel internally.

I was out on one of the tours they give tourists in the Everglades.  We were on a small boat taking pictures of the scenery and the animals when we can across a 10 foot alligator.   



The gator just sat there as we slowed down to get close.  Others on the ride wanted to take pictures, but not me. I wanted to get close to it and touch it.



I quietly slipped off the boat and slowly swam up behind it.  I heard gasps behind me, the others just noticed me. The tour guide quietly asked me to get back on the boat, I refused.



I reached my hand it to touch the alligator's back when it noticed me.  I didn't know alligators could move that fast. The last thing I remembered was the alligator grabbing me.  I got my touch, just not the touch I was expecting.

My wife would be here, but I sat beside this very bed just under three years ago, making sure she wasn't alone as she softly slid into heaven.

I can feel it, it's close. It's never a good sign if you can feel your heart strain to beat. But still I hope that someone will show.

""Yeah, but she's tough. She's one of those who somehow always bounce back.""

I could hear the nurses in the hallway talking. I wish they wouldn't do that. I know everyone's business around here. Poor Mr. Kenshaw with the dementia and a sex drive too high for a man his age. Mr. Lang with the pooping disease, c-diff. Mrs. Studner with that new sore on her thigh. I tell her all the time she needs to get out of bed more. They say it's oozing now. 

Soon, I won't have to hear anymore. 

Now, where is that nurse's aide? I put my light on at least 10 minutes ago! 

""Hi Miss Abby! Sorry it took so long"" she rolls her eyes playfully, ""you know how it is! Are you ready to get in to bed?""

It is Sarah, my favorite of them all. I'm so happy she is here tonight. There's nobody else I'd rather see in my final moments. 

""Yes dear,"" I reply with a heartfelt smile, ""I've already got my night dress on""

""Alright Miss Abby, I'm going to count to 3 and we'll stand together. 1..2..3, up we go.""

I can feel a tear welling up in my eye as she gently eases me in to bed. I hold it back though. I don't want her to feel sad. I'm ready for this. 

Sarah pulls the blankets over me and turns to walk out the door. ""Good night, I'll see you tomorrow!"" she says. 

""Sarah?""

""Yes ma'am?""

""You're always so good to me. I love you like my own granddaughter.""

""Awe, I love you too! Sweet dreams, Miss Abby!"" And with that, she flicks off the lights and walks out the door leaving me to my thoughts. 

I close my eyes and thoughts of my beloved Nicholas run through my mind. Oh how I've missed him. We had plans of passing together, holding hands, in a nursing home such as this. But, as we all know, life rarely goes as planned. It's been 17 long years since his fateful accident.

Downtown the people walked with a spring in their step, the weekend was thinking about arriving. Me, I was tired. Good cases were hard to come by and with the winter paranoia and the spring fever vaporizing in the late May heat, it was only going to get harder. Truth be told, I was in a rough patch long before the road-salt dried on the blacktop. My last big case was back in March the year before. 

Not that I didn't have work. My current client was paying me $100 to spy on her husband. She claims that he must be cheating, why else would he be gone so long and not invite her. So here I was, tailing a man who couldn't look more comfortably middle aged if he tried. It was unbearably humid, and I was so soaked in sweat that my wool jacket was sticking heavily to my back. It was to my great relief when Mr. Nernt turned into a mall. 

Inside it was blessedly cool despite the sheer volume of patrons frequenting the shops and kiosks dotted regularly along the way. I was hard pressed to keep on my man. Picking up the pace I pushed my way past some freakishly tall youth into the space I saw Mr. Nernt depart. Imagine my surprise when I stumble into a meeting of not only my target but four other men. Amoung them was none other than my old roommate Bert Velcis. 
""Berty?""
I said.
""Chris! You're joining the campaign?""
""What? No. I'm just... Nernt, your wife says hi.""
""Jesus, did she pay you to... tail Me?""
""Yep.""
""Goddamnit Carol.""
""Why didn't you just tell her?""
""BEC-because, last time I invited her it was a disaster!""
""Well, She thinks You're cheati-""
""See you later guys!""

""Damn Chris...""
""Sorry.""
""No, It's fine... he was our healer so, you know what? Why don't you come along Chris, you can roll up a character and fill in for Larry until... yeah.""
""You don't think the GM will mind?""
""Nah, Greg's pretty laid back.""
""Okay, sure why not.""
""Sweet, the game starts at 6.""

""Okay Chris is at -6 hp""
""I re-apply the bandage.""
""You need to roll a 6 or lower to stop the bleeding.""
""Okay... damn, 4.""

They tell you they found something strange, something magical - something that’s making them younger. But now, they‘re on the run, and they need your help.",Becauseisaidsotoo,"My cellphone was ringing, I took it out of my pocket.  That unknown number again, I usually don't answer those, but this was the eighth time in the last 30 minutes.  I hit the answer icon, “hello?”




“Thank God you finally answered.”




“Mom? Did you get a new phone number?  Is something wrong?”




“It's a burner phone, we need you to meet us somewhere with a lot of people.  Can you get some cash for us?”




“Yeah, what's going on?  We can't discuss it over the phone, they might be listening. Where can we meet you at?” The phone call began to break up.




“I’ll meet you in front of my favorite store in one hour.”




“Good, see you then,” the voice on the other end said, “make sure you are not followed.”  She hung up before I could ask and more questions.




Puzzled at what was going on I called dad's phone.  A voice I didn't recognize answered demanding to know where I was at.  I quickly hung up the phone. My parents were obviously in trouble and I had to find out why.




I withdrew enough cash to see them safely out of the city and then made my way to the pet shop in the mall.  I drove the long way there, making extra turns and backtracking a little too make sure I wasn't followed. 




The parking lot was packed, that meant there would be plenty of people.  I slowly made my way to the shop and waited inside, pretending to look at the animals. A younger couple followed me inside and started to look around too.  




I took a quick look at the couple and was shaken, they looked eerily similar to my parents in their wedding day pictures.  The couple slowly made their way towards me, pretending to look at some rabbit hay. The man cleared his throat and whispered, “you were not followed were you?”




My eyes widened, “dad?”, I whispered.




He nodded, “we can explain, I know we look young but it's us.” The woman who looked like my mother nodded.  




“I called your phone, someone else answered it, who was that?”




“One of the people we are running from, we found something and they want it.  That's what has changed us.” My mother whispered, her face pale.


--------


“So what is going on?,” I asked taking a sip of coffee.  We were sitting at a table in the food court. 




“You know the wooden area behind the house?” 



I nodded.  “A sink hole opened up in the middle, I saw something at the bottom of it.  I decided to climb down and investigate because the hole wasn't very deep. I found a black wooden box.”. My dad and mom gave each other a look. 




“A box? Was there anything inside it?”




They slowly nodded, my mother was going pale again.  “I took it to the house and your mother and I opened it.  There was a small, black, glass ball. When I picked it up it started glowing with a light and suddenly we were young again.  We made the mistake of calling the police, next thing we knew helicopters were flying over head and soldiers were trying to break down or front door. So now we are here.” 

I opened my mouth and my dad shook his head, “don't ask to see it because we don't have it with us, it is hidden somewhere safe.  We didn't know what it would do around a large group of people.”




“Shit,” I exclaimed and then covered my mouth, “sorry mom.” 



She shook her head, “don't apologize this is a shit moment.”



“So you are leaving?  Where will you go?”



“It's best you didn't know, how much money did you bring us?,” my dad cutting straight to the point, “and do you still keep that gun in the car?” My mom clasped my dad's hand looking at him questionly.




“Two thousand and yes it's in my glove box.”




“Good, could we take the car too? We need a fast way or of the city.” I nodded and handed him the keys and the envelope with the cash in it.




I walked them to the parking lot and we said our goodbyes.  “We might not be in touch for awhile, but we will call you when we are safe.”




My mother was crying now, she hugged me tightly.  “Stay safe and remember I love you.”




I started to choke up, “I love you too Mom.”




They got in the car and drove away with my mom turned and looking back at me.

I quickly turned it off, my whole body cold with shock. 

*My father was dead*.

Granted, he was a superhero, so this was inevitable. He was strong, but not invincible—but slightly more long-lived than most. My children loved him, my wife loved him, and I didn’t hate him. He was a terrible father but a great man, and I recognized that. But now he was dead. It just didn’t feel real—not being able to see him every morning on the news, call him on holidays so he could visit and surprise the kids—all of it felt so unreal.

Then something knocked on the window.

“Honey,” my wife called to me. “There’s something at the window.”

I nodded, still not able to properly process what was going around me. I stood up and my chair fell but I didn’t really care. I slowly walked to the window and pulled apart the curtains to discover the source of the noise.

It was my father’s emblem, knocking on the window. In a daze I opened the window up, allowing the emblem in. It fell on the floor, hitting the wood with a dull thud. I picked up the blood-stained green gem, holding it in my trembling hands.

“Dear? What is it?” 

I ignored her voice as I stared at the green crystal split into two in my hands. It fell into two pieces and a small note fell out of a secret compartment in the middle. I held the two halves of the emblem in one hand and opened the note with the other, reading its contents slowly.

*I leave it all to you, my dead son. Signed, Your Father*

The note slipped through my hands as the two halves of the emblem clicked together again. It flew out of my hand and into the air, floating in front of my face. As I stared at the carved markings in the emblem I heard a voice in my head.

*Are you ready?*

I tenderly reached out for the floating emblem. 

My life was never the same again. ",luardemin

The Statue Of Liberty’s janitor knows what to do. He opens the supply closet’s hidden door, sits in the control chair, and fires up his lady.",Becauseisaidsotoo,"My Country

I look at my country - its institutions, monuments, and citizens - differently now, and the rest of the world does too. Now that the literal dust has settled, we can make sense of what happened - almost. 

Most of us can remember where we were, when we heard the news. I had just gotten to work, and had gotten an alert on my phone about Mount Rushmore being destroyed. Which, I guess you could say, was fake news, because it was followed by additional news alerts, saying it was an avalanche, no, an earthquake, and then, aerial footage came in, of what it actually was. Mount Rushmore hadn’t exploded, it had stood up. Explosively, violently, shaking off trees, rocks, and huge clods of dirt. It appeared to be a huge robot, carved out of massive slabs of rock, one with four familiar, stoic faces. A huge robot that was, impossibly, now running through the South Dakota wilderness, trailing dust and devastation in it’s wake.

I refused to believe it at first, most of us did. Till reports from other media sources confirmed it, and footage started trickling in, of crushed bodies, cars, homes, towns, and cities. The monster, and that’s what it really was, seemed set on causing the maximum amount of death and destruction possible, and nothing could stop it. It could swat planes and helicopters out of the sky, step on tanks, and dodge rockets. It ignored artillery fired at it, and it moved fast, running with huge strides that crushed the landscape beneath it’s tread.

I, my co-workers, my countrymen, and the world, watched in horror, as a national monument, perverted beyond recognition, went on a rampage, destroying my fellow Americans, our country, and to some degree, our national sanity. Because, as we watched in shocked disbelief, the mantra that went through my mind, all of our minds, was that this was insane, this was impossible, and that this couldn’t be happening.

But it was.

We all saw the horror of it. Scenes of death and devastation as it tore through an American state, like a knife through skin, cutting deeper and deeper.

And then the news came in of the Statue of Liberty’s forced evacuation, and then it’s explosion. That’s what they thought at first. That it had exploded. A moment later that was revised, it hadn’t exploded, it had launched off it’s pedestal, and was now heading inland. It was at first assumed that the statue was a missile, that it had been all along. A nuclear missile, hidden in plain sight - one that had now been launched by our leaders at the rampaging monster on American soil. Photos and video footage captured it’s flight as it arched through the spacious sky’s, Lady Liberty, torch aloft, her face calm and placid. Flying to her doom, to unspeakable devastation - the horror of a nuclear detonation on American soil. 

A lone camera man filmed her landing. It was a live satellite feed and I’m sure he expected to be annihilated in the explosion.

Liberty missed. Hitting down several hundred feet away from Mount Rushmore. She landed in a billow of dust, and failed to explode. I heard a collected moan of despair from my co-workers around me. We had gathered around the TV in the conference room at this point, and we could smell each other’s fear and terror.

And then, from the settling dust - Liberty rose up. We, as one, recoiled from the TV. Here was another living monument, another monster, another horror. But then, Liberty, with a strange stop-motion grace, aimed her torch at the huge mountainous figure looming over her, and from it, she released a blast of blinding light.

She was fighting for us!

She was tiny, a fraction of the size of the monster, but she was quick, she was armed with her torch, she used her tablet as a shield against the rocks the monster hurled, and she kept her distance. She fired shot after shot at the monster with four faces, chipping away at the stone.

It roared with four mouths and staggered backwards, and as it staggered back, she fired again, directly into Washington’s open mouth. The monster, dazed, and flailing it’s massive limbs, fell backwards - flattening the land beneath it.

Lady Liberty strolled closer, tiny in comparison. She raised her torch, aimed, and then - stopped. She dropped her tablet and torch and seemed to clutch at her chest, as though she was having a heart attack. And then, she collapsed at the feet of the monster, which had stopped thrashing, and was starting to roll over. It was starting to rise up.

The nation, screamed in horror, screamed for her to get up, get up!

And she started to. Rising slowly, clumsily, and the monster did the same - but faster. It got to it’s feet too, and loomed above her - it was scarred, but not damaged, and it’s three and a half remaining faces, glared down at it’s tiny, clumsy, struggling adversary.

Something had changed, she was slower now, awkward, and she scrambled away from one huge stomping foot, and barely avoided another swatting hand. She dived clumsily for her torch, and was hit by a massive rock the monster hurled at her. She was damaged, but had her weapon now, and she raised it shakily, and fired it, again and again at the stone faces, fired again and again, till the control room was exposed, fired as the monster lumbered towards her, and as it collapsed on top of her, she thrust a damaged and broken hand into the smoking crater where the monster’s central two faces had been. And as the mountain fell on her, she killed it’s controller. 

Emergency personnel pulled three people from the rubble that day. A crazed loner, who had been hiking, and had discovered the control room for the mountain, the monster, Mount Rushmore. 

They had to use the jaws of life to pry his crushed corpse out of Liberty’s grasp. 

Inside of Liberty, they found two more people. One, was the janitor, who had launched her, and started the battle. He was an elderly veteran of two wars, and had worked undercover, as the janitor, at the Statue Of Liberty, for over 40 years. At the climactic moment of the battle, his brave, aged heart had failed him, and he’d collapsed in his harness, clutching at his chest - slowly, painfully dying. He, we, had been fortunate though. He had an assistant there with him. A young Mexican man, who had recently become a citizen, and had just been hired as a junior member of the janitorial crew. 

He’d been with the old man when the news had broke, seen the old man’s face go pale with shock. He’d helped him into the harness, and when the old man’s heart had failed him, he’d grabbed the controls, asking the dying man questions in broken English, doing his best to understand the old man’s gasping replies, fighting for both of their lives, fighting for ours as well.

When they pulled the men from the rubble, the younger man had his arms around the body of the old man. The younger man had tried to protect him till the end. The nation saw it’s heroes, it’s saviors, birthed from the rubble. One, frail, pale, and sadly gone, and the other, with dark skin covered in bruises, scratches, and blood, and dark eyes that looked imploringly into the reporters’ cameras, as if asking them, asking us, to help his friend, and to help him.

""They're probably from North Korea, Larry. No worries,"" Bob calmly replied as he flipped on the rocket shoe boosters. He was fine with North Koreans.. Bob just liked messing with Larry.

There was a large crunching noise as TBL's feet separated from the rocks. That initial jolt gave Bob pause, wondering if there was an issue, but then TBL was flying high above New York smoothly. 

""This is what Elon Musk must feel like as he travels to Jupiter's Rings,"" Bob thought to himself. 

TBL's voice popped up all around him. ""ETA of 27 minutes to destination, Bob."" 

Bob's large flying object's social anxiety started to creep up like a shadow, ""Th-tha-thanks TBL. We're going to jerk this four-headed dude off!"" Bob facepalmed... He hated how he got awkward every time  the giants of the world needed him.

Collecting himself, Jenkins flips up the switch cover and turns Lady Liberty on. 

*CHOOM* 

Outside of the statue, green eyes open, and the seam of a rather large green dress begins to sway, and crackle, and break. 

Jenkins can see what Lady Liberty sees thanks to his patent pending camera eyeball technology. After taking a few tenacious steps off the podium using the two leg levers at each side of his chair, Jenkins sighed. He once again remembered what his father, and his father's father did to maintain the statue and do battle against tyranny. 

Jenkins' grandfather used to tell him stories all the time about how his statue used to be powered with coal, fire, and steam instead of wires and electricity. ""That's the real American way"", he'd preach. 

The Statue of Liberty seemingly cracked a smile as she walked straight towards Mount Rushmore. Jenkins' arms weren't tired yet, thanks to years of sweeping and using a basic mop. He turns the levers faster, and exclaims: ""Looks like it's time to go cross-country!"", as the statue picked up the pace.

"[WP] What are your goals in life, like real, attainable ones? Where do you see yourself going? Write me a story of your realistic perfect life.",jpiethescienceguy,"The air hummed with a silence rich enough to dull gold. Like a blanket, it covered me as I sat on the dock and sipped my tea, its steam brushing my skin. In the first few weeks, the silence was not so hospitable. It was like swimming in a murky unknown lake, confident enough nothing underneath will attack you, but afraid enough not to actually enjoy yourself. City sounds were what I grew up with. Alcoholics yelling and drunk people singing, babies crying and mothers cooing, cars blaring music and dogs barking along….there were some moments I felt like I was living inside an orchestra, and sometimes it was beautiful. The forest silence jarred me. I would prepare my lungs to start screaming the moment I felt myself drowning, but deep down I knew no scream would be loud enough to cover the quiet. As I saw the first strands of golden light peak over the mountain, I took a breath with the silence, and watched as our echo disappeared across the water.

I looked behind at my small cabin, seeing the first home I’ve ever had. My chest rising and falling with the ease of a conductor and their baton, I dipped a toe in the still water and delighted in its subtle ripple. Breathing used to be as unnatural to me as running on all fours. Most people have empty lungs reserved for oxygen, but mine were filled with hundreds of venomous snakes. When I wasn’t stopping them from slithering out of my throat to poison the rest of the world, they were suffocating me like a meal they haven’t had in days. I lay my back on the dock and looked up at the youthful sky, letting the air flow through me freely. 

Sitting up, I sip my tea and feel its warmth run through my body like a hot shower. Behind me I hear my name being gently called with no hint of expectations or judgement. Sitting here, on an empty dock with nothing in the world but silence and fresh air, everything is going to be okay.",IamCthaeh

[WP] The war has been going on so long that you have forgotten why you are even fighting in the first place,HarbringerOfMayhem,"They slogged through the trenches, their feet squelching in the mud, boots soaked through, only useful now to protect them from unforgiving rocks that hid in the sodden earth. It felt like it had been months since he could even imagine the feeling of dry socks, of anything that wasn't the cold wind that chilled his bones and the echo of gunfire that seemed endless at times. Now he simply followed the path of those in front of him, barely thinking of where they were heading, not really caring if he was honest. It took all he had to simply put one step in front of the other, to not collapse and simply give in to the deep pit of exhaustion that had been growing in his chest. Still, he pushed on.

He thought back to the first months of the war, when they had been certain it would be over by Christmas. He had believed them, thinking that come Yuletide he'd be sitting down to dinner with his family, his children chattering excitedly about the gifts they had received. But of course, that hadn't come to pass. He had spent that Christmas as he for each of them these past years, cold and wet. He could faintly remember the enthusiasm they had had back then, fueling them as they ran into combat. He knew now that they had known nothing of war, only of tales that they had grown up hearing, tales of the glory of fighting and the sweet taste of victory. He wished he could go back, to knock their heads together and tell them exactly what they signed up for. But wishes were useless here, he had learned that lesson well. 

He had learned many things during his time in the trenches. He had learned the horrors of chemical weapons, seeing men choke on their own breath as mustard gas seeped into their lungs and suffocated them slowly and painfully, until they drowned in their own blood as it filled their chest. He had learned the effects of the trenches, as men went mad in the deep pits and those unlucky enough to get trench foot had to watch as their feet turned black, unless they were the lucky few who got treated before infection set in fully. He now knew how it felt to lose someone, whether it was friends he had known for years or someone he had met just the night before. Worst of all he learned the feeling of a gun against his shoulder, and what it looked like when a man's lifeless body collapses after he pulled the trigger. He would have given anything at this point to have remained ignorant.

He used to dream of the day when they won, when they finally could leave these godforsaken tunnels, their weapons and their pains. He imagined going home, seeing his wife and children and celebrating with them. He had hoped that every new day would be the one that it would all end, that he could go home. But now as he trudged his way forward in the incessant rain, feet seeming to sink deeper with every step he took, he could only hope that the next time gunfire rang out across no man's land, he would not be alive to hear the next shot. A fitting end to a life that had become nothing but violence and death. He couldn't even remember why they had started fighting in the first place. He finds that he can't bring himself to care.

Now all that mattered was the end.",Tuftsie

The two of them suddenly relieved to see their jeep as they made their way back to the camp.  The conversation stopped as they made way for the water cans in the back of the jeep.  The water bottles hanging off of their packs had been empty the entire 30 minute trek from the dig site.  Will was disappointed that he was unable to find a way to reignite the conversation they were having on the hike on their way back to the base.  Noah seemed even more preoccupied with his thoughts then usual and Will did not want to interrupt him.

When they got back to the base they were greeted by the team that would escort Noah to the colonel for his debriefing.  It always made will nervous watching him walk away surrounded by armed guards.  It reminded him of a criminal being transported somewhere.  He could never wrap his head around why they were only shadowed by military escorts on the base.  It was like once they left they no longer existed to them.

“Anything new in there?” The colonel asked in his usual jovial tone.

“Actually quite a bit” Noah replied.

“Good this should be interesting.  It has been far too long since there has been any developments from within the cylinder.”

“Well, we got one of the screens to turn on.”

“Oh?” The colonel’s demeanor shifted as he suddenly became intensely interested in the conversation at hand.

“We now know that the vessel was a transport ship and original estimate of it being approximately 4,000 years old was correct.”

“What was it transporting?”  The colonel interrupted in anticipation.

“Prisoners.  43 of them”

“Is that the only thing that was on the ship?”

“Yes, sir.  Will is still leading the excavation in the surrounding area.  They have located several camps.  It does not look like they arrived with much and we have been unable to find the remains of any lifeforms.”

“Very good. Thank you Noah you can be dismissed”

“Sir, one thing.  It will really help to be able to have my assistant inside the cylinder.” 

“Given the new developments I agree. His access will be updated.”

Noah was taken back to his hotel room on the base.  He was excited when he saw Will waiting for him in the lobby working on his laptop.  He was been trying to get Will into the cylinder ever since it was found and he finally had the good news.

“C’mon.  I got some good news.” Noah called out to Will.

“You’re in.” Noah said quietly as the two of them begin walking to their rooms.

“What?” Will exclaimed trying disparately to hold back his excitement.

“You get to come with me tomorrow when we get back to camp.  Instead of digging up those old tents.”

“How did the colonel take the news?”

“He is still hopeful we will find weapons but, it is simply not that kind of ship.”

“Are you going to watch the news tonight the mars orbiter will be passing the moon?  Furthest any human has ever travelled from the earth.”

“Don’t think that is something you would want to miss.”

Adam Everett had been in space many times but this time was different.  In just a couple of minutes he would know for sure if he had accomplished his goals.  As his ship passed the moon he was in the capsule so he could get the best view.  The next few minutes were unbearable as he searched out of every window.  Could this be it?  Was he finally free of that rock?  He could no longer stay.  Everything reminded him of Evelyn.  He would outrun her memory even if it meant running back into their hands.  A flash of light sent panic through Adam to his core he would not be allowed to leave they have come back for him.  He searched the windows to find it was only a momentary reflection in the glass.  The realization hit him far greater than he ever thought it would.  They were not coming.  No one was going to stop him from leaving.  They had been tethered to that rock by their own fear of what the consequences may have been.  No one had ever escaped one before.  He turned the radios off and started to burn the engines.  He had no plans of stopping at the 4th rock after leaving the 3rd he would find a ride somewhere.

"[WP] Humans have committed atrocious crimes according the inter-galactic government. As a punishment, we were sent to a gravitational prison. Known simply to us as Earth.",School_account_jms,"The shuttle door rattled as it plunged into the atmosphere. Bernard winced. He ought to have been used to this sensation by now, of course. Bernard had spent several years working on the design and construction of the X42s during his assignment on Ceres-193, and he was intimately familiar with the shuttle’s stress test results. Designed to withstand entry to Jupiter’s atmosphere in normal operation, and sufficiently shielded to endure interstellar radiation levels, reentry to Facility E posed no threat to the transport.

Bernard reached to adjust the shackles around his ankle.

“Bos’hh, bos’hh,” warned one of the shuttle guards, his own hand reaching for the butt of his static blaster.

He raised his hands in defeat and slouched back against the shuttle wall.

“Bastards,” interjected a voice next to Bernard. The guard turned to look, “Absolute bunch of no good, waste of time, waste of space, dog-faced bastards.”

Bernard averted his gaze.

“Aye, you,” the guard moved closer to the man, “We got out of here before this, and we’ll get out of here again. And when we do, you’re damn right we’ll be coming after you, and your dog-faced kids, and your dog-faced—augh”

The shuttle jolted again as the guard unleashed a bolt from his static blaster. Bernard glanced down at the man as he writhed along the floor. The man’s eyes seemed to meet with Bernard’s own as he convulsed and twitched. Bernard looked away.

Static blasters weren’t designed to kill. Their barrels were loaded with a Corellium bolt that was charged by static electricity absorbed from the air around them. Humans were particularly susceptible to their effects. On contact with human skin, the Corellium bolt was absorbed by the body, and the static electricity diffused throughout the victim’s muscles, causing tremendous pain and convulsions in the target. Ironically, perhaps, the Corellium acted as a healing and anti-scarring agent, meaning that no mark was left upon the victim after the attack. By intergalactic law they were, technically, banned under the premise of being a ‘cruel and unusal’ form of punishment. Since proving their use was, in reality, impossible, they had become ubiquitous sidearms for the Hanuvian militias that ran the detention facilities throughout the galaxy.

There were sixteen thousand inmates accompanying Bernard on his travel to Facility E. The majority, like himself, had been collected on Ceres-193 following the final verdict that humanity had been found guilty of breaching Order 79 — the intergalactic commitment to avoid contact, communication, and contamination with any sentient species prior to their evolution into a space-faring race. Humans across the galaxy had since been rounded up and were being transported to Hanuvian  Dentention Facility E. Earth.

It was a harsh punishment, even by Hanuvian standards. The crime for which humanity was accused had occurred several hundred years ago, and no further infractions had been incurred since. Bernard himself was unable to trace his family history back even as far as the time that the crime was committed. Humanity’s population had increased exponentially since their departure from Earth, too: what had been a rather humble twelve billion humans had now increased to near a trillion.

Moreover, Facility E was specially reserved for those most serious infractions of intergalactic law. Humans had exploited almost all of Earth’s natural resources in building and fuelling its first few Lifeships that sought to take them away from their home. What had once been vast swathes of arable farmland now lay as dust-filled mines. Oceans had atrophied as the Lifeships’ water storage tanks were filled. Rivers had all but ceased to flow; wildlife was almost hunted to extinction and now ran sinewy and sour; sunlight was rationed to two hours per day by the almost impenetrable covering of ash left in the Lifeships’ wake; and seasons no longer followed one another but quarrelled as the hollowed Earth tumbled around its axis. Humanity, Bernard knew, was sent to this gravitational prison to end.

The guard uttered another Hanuvian phrase into his commlink and took a seat in the cabin as the shuttle prepared to land.",RLMorganWrites

"[WP] Someone makes it their lifelong goal to commit every sin possible. After they die, Satan is struggles to decide which eternal punishment is most fitting for them.",Baronnolanvonstraya,"The final sin was committed at moment of its occurrence to the knowledge of no one. Three days later they found his body hanging in his garage, slowly spinning from the draft of the door. His neighbor, Mrs. Bradford, screamed in shock, dropping the garden tools she had borrowed as she stood in horror unable to comprehend what hung before her.

While Mrs. Bradford tried to decide how she could fix this knowing there was nothing to be done Wayne Martin made his way down a narrow sidewalk that seemed to float unaided by the constraints of a world he knew but he did not question this. The knowledge that falling off would mean nothing. He was already dead. He feared the abyss out of instinct and proceeded carefully following the short man with a shuffle and traced his steps with his own.

Wayne had met the man who walked with a shuffle when he came to retrieve him from what he thought was heaven, a bright white space he had been suspended within. He was laying horizontal, he came to discover, seemingly floating in the bright white abyss, when the old man shuffled in. He heard the noise, softly at first, a slight rustling and he turned his head towards it finding a man shuffling through a door that had appeared before him, as the shuffling man lowered him to the floor, slow enough so that he could find his feet beneath him, the room’s shape began to materialize and the thought that this must be purgatory came through his mind.

Knowing better than to ask questions he didn't necessarily want to know the answer to he said nothing and followed the old man out of the room discovering the black abyss he hadn't noticed when the door was first opened by the shuffling man.

He followed the man down the black walkway until they reached a set of double doors, also black, as seemed to be the theme, he'd never thought God to be a prankster but he spent each step trying to convince himself of otherwise.

The office was surprisingly well lit. Modern in design, two couches sat facing another in the center of the room, an armchair with it’s back to the door and a desk dwarfed by the view granted by the floor to ceiling windows. Wayne inched further drawn to the window, and a brief glance around the room confirmed that nobody was around so he took the liberty. He stood for what felt like eternity, beside the desk, knowing better than to go behind another mans desk, trying to make sense of what he saw below.

Wayne found himself smiling, almost a slight chuckle coming to breath when a voice startled him. It was quick and clipped like a NY stockman, “You know I don’t meet with newcomers often. Ever really if I can help it” tossing the formality of a greeting aside.      Wayne turned quickly and immediately regretted it, fearing he looked awkward.

He turned to find a man dressed in a suit he wore with comfort, jet black hair and a bolt of white through the middle. Wayne was taken aback by the man who chuckled. He knew the reaction well.

“You, Wayne Martin, are a man I insisted I meet in person.” He walked as he talked, finishing as he reached Wayne, offering his hand. Wayne smiled questioningly as he shook it. “you see,” he said stepping aside to gaze out the window “the world is divided into sides. Democrats and republicans, cat people and dog people, yanni people and laurel people.” he paused collecting his thoughts “you see everything falls upon a bell curve. Not a spectrum” he shot Wayne a glance to drive his point

“At either end are the most extreme cases. Luckily they are few and far between and the majority of people fall in the middle, this a bell curve.” he traced a bell through the air with his hand “be one hell of a world if it wasn't that way, he turned on his heel to bring himself back in front of Wayne “for everything in the universe there is an opposite, for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, but I don't need to tell you that Wayne Martin.” He kept the formality of his full name to drive his point “I’d always thought of myself the equal and opposite to God. I’ve had those follow in my footsteps on earth but they’ve failed to reach the noriety of the one so close to his image they call him his son. You see anyone who is the son of God is still half of someone else. Of course there have been those you would have called the son of Lucifer, if only you’d heard of them. Only you haven't because me, the Devil, has the worst marketing team in the world.”

Wayne was hearing the words but could make no sense of them. “I see you’re confused” he gestured towards the couches “please, a seat and I’ll explain it all and hopefully you will understand my predicament.” together they approached the sitting area choosing opposite couches.

Lucifer smiled, “you see,” he began “you lived the last 64 years in the world as you’ve known it, a world of apple vs android, twitter vs Facebook, and you were free to pick and choose whichever world you wanted to live in based on what you decided to believe and at times it was difficult and you felt lost. Luckily the afterlife we make that decision for you. Not me of course” he cracked a smile “The best and the brightest we’ve got! They negotiate against the best and brightest God’s got and sometimes when a new guy gets the case one or two slips through the cracks but we usually sort those out thanks to our exchange program, but you,” he pointed “you were something special, there wasn't even a debate. Both sides at that negotiating table had respect for you, for different reasons mind you.

Which brings me to my dilemma. You see.” He stood walking once more to the window. “I had always thought that the world existed of left and right, light and dark and that I was the dark not because I was bad but because I had come second and the better option had already been taken, but now I think otherwise.”

“Why’s that” Wayne was surprised with the force of his voice

“I am not evil. I am not the sadistic demon concocting new and creative ways to punish people. I am the victim of a slander campaign. Hell is not a burning pit of fire and eternal damnation. The only damnation is that from heaven not from happiness. You see I see the world in a different way than he does. I wanted something better than what I saw around me and I wanted to go about creating it in a different way and like anyone with a dream of their own God wanted it his way and I was forced to leave or be forced to live in someone else fantasy, so I left and I paid for it but those who find their path here, despite the initial disappointment come to realize this too is great. Funny thing is I’d always wondered if someone else would come along and feel the same and I always hoped I’d let them off with my blessing to pursue what they thought would be best. To not give them the same treatment I'd been given, but I'd also wondered if spite is part of drive..”

“I’m sorry, maybe I’m still a bit turned around here but can you tell me what’s going on”

“Of course, of course. I'll put it simply. I had always thought I was the true opposite God."" He paused for a moment. ""Now I know that isn't true. You."" turning to face Wayne ""You are the true opposite to God. I fear that what I have begun to create will pale in comparison to what is to come. But I also fear that we can not work together. You see polar opposites tend to look and act nearly identical in all ways but one.""

""but what sets us apart? What makes me so radical?""

""I have not yet committed the final sin. I’ve committed all others out of personality but I’ve feared to commit the sin that brought you to me.",lolaturswaggy

The last thing he expected to encounter in this uncharted, ancient place, just humming with the tainted, vindictive vibrations of a thousand broken gods, was this friendly boy. He just emanated this happy energy and we connected right away. I knew, instantly, by his kind eyes that he intended me no harm. No harm at all.


Too bad for him.


I had a job to do and I couldn't risk him leading anyone else here. If that meant killing him - so be it. The secrets of the temple must remain secret. Fuck knows what would happen if the knowledge within became without.


Still. I don't relish killing him. One of the friendliest creatures I've ever encountered. A good boy...

""Elan, you can't be serious. You've built an empire here. We're just about to make it big, man. You can't abandon me like this, not now.""

I walked away. 

I can't explain it, really. Riko was right, I'd spent years cornering the deathstick market. I just got a fresh shipment in yesterday, all ready to unload on the scum of Coruscant. 

Yesterday....shit it's still a blur. I remember hitting up the Outlander club like usual, it's usually a sure thing for a few drunken assholes looking for a quick fix and without a clue what the going rate should be. I was at the bar, had my Bantha juice cocktail, and....God I can't remember much else. I woke up here, at home.

I walked back into the Outlander club at 2:00pm. ""Skrog it's sad in here during the daytime"". 

""Easy on the language buddy"", rebuked the almost-human looking bartender. 

""You were here last night, right?"" I asked him as he poured out the Dantooine ice-twist for the blue-skinned gal on the end of the bar. She was torn between trying to catch my eye and nursing her obvious hangover from the night before with a little hair of the Bantha. The bartender nodded.

""Do you remember me? Did you see me here last night?""

""Sure did. You were in a hurry to get out of here.""

""I'm having a little trouble remembering, did someone maybe drug me?""

""Well, you came up to the bar talking to this robed guy, God did he cause some.....

""Farkle, that's right! Jesus looking outsider, I remember. Thanks, I gotta run"".

""If you find him"", said the bartender, ""send him my way. Laserbrain caused quite a mess in here last night"".

 Did he mess with my mind? Did he drug me? All I knew was, I wanted out of the deathstick game. I didn't know why.

I think I'll move to Alderaan, seems like a good place to set up a home. I hear good things. Nice, quiet place. I'm going to build a life for myself, I'm done with this scene. I want to live a long, healthy life. I guess I should thank that robed, long haired angel for helping me rethink my life.

""Sorry, Tom,"" George said. ""Alex and Aaron requested that this confrontation be private.""

Tom looked annoyed, but left. 

""Ungrateful bastard,"" Aaron muttered as soon as Tom left. ""He gets control of the country and now he thinks he needs to know everything.""

""Cool it, Aaron,"" George said. ""Alright. It's dawn. Aaron and Alexander row across the river in separate boats. One boat has the guns, and the other the doctor. As you step off the boat, make a Perception check, Alex.""

Alex pushed his glasses up on his nose, grimacing. He had an 8 in Wisdom, and that negative modifier had hurt him many times before. He held his breath and rolled. 

17.

""Nat 17, so that's a 16,"" Alex said. 

""As you look around, you recognize this place,"" George said. ""This is near the spot your son died.""

Alex stiffened. He loved his son, both in and out of character. Alex's son, Phil, had played with them earlier as one of his major allies in the first major story arc. Once that arc ended, Phil's character John was killed off so he could roll up a son for Alexander. 

Phil's new character lasted for half a session before dying in a duel. 

""Aaron, Alexander, you are both presented with a pistol,"" George said. ""The doctor turns away for deniability, and you are now standing back to back. What do you do?""

Aaron and Alex looked at each other. 

""No hard feelings?"" Aaron said. 

""No hard feelings,"" Alex said. He then turned to George. ""We both start walking.""

""Alright,"" George said. ""You walk away from each other. Five... six... seven... eight... nine paces. Do you take the last step?""

""I do,"" Aaron said. 

""I do too,"" Alex said. 

""You both take the tenth pace,"" George said. ""When you do, you spin around. Both of you make a ranged attack roll.""

It was Aaron's turn to wince. His Dexterity was abysmal, so his shot would likely go wide. His dice clattered to the table, and he stared at it in shock. What would normally be a cause for celebration was instead a source of growing horror. 

Natural 20.

As per their rules, Aaron rolled again. Anything other than a natural 1 or natural 20 would do nothing. A natural 1 would cancel the crit, and a natural 20 would cause a new roll. 

Natural 20. 

With a growing sense of dread, Aaron rolled again. When the dice stopped rolling, he stared in shock. 

Natural 20. Three in a row. 

Instant death. 

""Aaron?"" George asked. ""What's your roll?""

""Triple nat 20,"" Aaron said. 

""Alex?"" George said, still processing the turn of events. ""What's your roll?""

""28,"" Alex said. ""But it doesn't matter. I'm shooting into the sky.""

""Alright, then,"" George said. ""Aaron, as you fire your gun, you watch Alexander raise his pistol to the sky and shoot it.
