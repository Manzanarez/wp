""Use Obliviate to erase any memories, Scourgify to clean the evidence, and Impressus to flatten the crops in a circle around them.  Muggles have lots of stories about crop circles.  If they tell the story to anyone, even if they get someone to come look at the scene with them, they'll look like one of those alien abduction nutjobs.""

""Pretty clever,"" his partner agreed. ""I've got all the dragon guts cleaned up, but there's this one Muggle here with green skin.  Any idea how to fix it?""

""Let me take a look... *Revelo Infirmitas.*  That's weird.  I'm not seeing anything wrong with him.  Skin condition, maybe?  Anyway, whatever he's got, it's not going to reveal the existence of magic.  Leave the Muggles to figure it out and let's go.""

With two sharp *cracks*, the two wizards disapparated.

...

Moments later, two sharply-dressed men in black suits came running in.

""Jesus, take a look at this, E.  A crop circle, an X-Ray on the ground with a head injury, a bunch of civilians all around... are they even *trying* to stay secret any more?  This is the worst scene I've had to clean up in months!""

His partner nodded and nudged the green-skinned alien with his foot.  ""I'll let HQ know that the Reticulans are getting careless again.  How do you want to clean this up, T?""

""A scene this big, there's probably all sorts of alien material littered around.  I say we burn it back for a couple of meters and tell them it was a gas explosion.""

The second agent nodded and pulled a small silver device from his pocket.  ""You go back to the car and get the flamer, I'll wipe the civilians.""

...

""I'm very upset with how you handled that last case, Vigilus.  I just scryed on the location and the scorch marks from dragonfire are still clearly visible.  If you can't even clean up something that obvious, I shudder to think of what other clues you left lying around.""

""What?  We swept that whole place clean, I swear!  It should've been written off as an alien abduction hoax!""

""Port yourselves out there and fix it, or I'll bust you so far down you won't be allowed to Obliviate a *goldfish.*""

""Yessir.""

...

""Agent E, Agent T, follow-up crews have reported major anomalies at your last cover-up.""

""Really?  I thought it was a standard operation.  Gas explosion, temporary amnesia, the usual.""

""If it was a gas explosion..."" The Commander turned his computer screen so E could see the picture on it.  ""...then where are all the scorch marks?  And why is there a crop circle plainly visible in the center?""

""What?  I flamed the whole site, three meters each direction, standard controlled burn.  This makes no sense.""

""Then get back out there and make it *make* sense!  I've got the Reticulan Overlord on one phone and the Arcturus Ambassador on the other, I don't have time to teach two rookies which end of a flamer to hold.""

""Yes sir.""

...

*A few hours later*

""Vigilus, how many times have we been out here by now?""

""Oh, at least six or seven.  The Minister's getting rather upset.""

""I think we should ask one of the Muggles what's going on here.  This is rather strange.""

The wizard turned and looked at two men in dark suits in sunglasses, who were engaged in an animated discussion.  He overheard part of their conversation as he approached.

""...care if he's a looney wearing a bathrobe, we've been out here six times and we   need to know what's going on.""

""Excuse me!  You haven't seen anything strange around here, have you?""

The two men exchanged glances.  ""No?  No, we're just looking at a totally normal gas explosion here.  I don't suppose you've seen anything strange either, have you?""

""Oh, no, of course not.  Nothing supernatural at all.  Just taking a look at this perfectly normal crop circle.""

The wizard and the man in black stared at each other for a bit.  Agent E tilted his head thoughtfully.  ""Yeah... just a normal crop circle.  But, uh, hypothetically, if that crop circle disappeared because of a perfectly normal gas explosion, that wouldn't be, uh, *problematic,* would it?""

Vigilus frowned.  ""Well, it would be a little bit problematic.  Because, hypothetically, someone might mistake it for a supernatural event, like a dragon attack.  Not saying that dragons are real, but someone might get the wrong impression.  Especially if they weren't familiar with perfectly normal gas explosions.""

E took off his sunglasses and looked the wizard in the eye.  ""So, continuing the hypothetical, if you wanted to remove the crop circles without making it look like something silly like a dragon attack, what would you do?""

Vigilus stroked his beard.  ""Well, if I had some sort of magical ability to clean the scorch marks from the corn, it would be easy.  But I don't have such an ability, and if I did, I'd probably have to keep it secret.""

Agent E nodded.  ""I can imagine. And if I was some sort of government agent who covers up crop circles, I'd probably have a problem with that.  But fortunately, I'm not, so I think I'll just walk away and say that we picked a different way to cover up the aliens this time.""

""The hypothetical aliens?""

""Right, the hypothetical aliens.  Which don't exist.""

Vigilus nodded.  ""Well, hypotheticals aside, I think we can agree that we shouldn't have any crop circles or gas explosions here, no matter how perfectly normal they are.""  He moved his wand behind his back, and the corn was once more golden and undisturbed.

Agent E nodded.  ""Thanks.  It's been a pleasure.""

""E?  What was all that about?""

E put his sunglasses back on.  ""Oh, it was just another perfectly normal guy, just like both of us.""",Aegeus

"[WP] The world's weight is set. If someone loses a pound, someone else gains it.",KJ_jk,"""It's not entirely unethical Mrs. Obama,"" the chief scientist said as they walked down a cold bland corridor of the CDC.

""Well ethics are swayable, if it achieves enough happiness for the whole..."" Michelle brushed her skirt straight and let the silence fill in the blanks for her.

""I wholeheartedly agree,"" Mr. Neit typed in an eight digit code and bent down to match his retina to the scanner. A bank vault like door slid open vertically followed by another gate sliding open horizontally; Mrs. Obama followed him. ""Now this is where we keep the bioweapons in case we ever needed to synthesize a cure-""

""Or if Barack hits the green button, or yellow for that matter. I swear that man's job is all about buttons just on an endless switchboard.""

""Yes, we are also prepared to...defend ourselves if necassary but it won't be in the near future. At least not with these fellas. We can make your policies look better and better- you could lead the world with a weightloss initiative and it would be nothing but simple arithmetic to discover the answer to the average American's problems with their belly,"" Mr. Niet said. Green human sized test tubes lined the walls and just beyond the scientist's head was a much girthier tube. Michelle couldn't make out what was in it with him in the way.

""Is that an American Mr.Niet?!"" Michelle questioned as they stood at their destination. The girthy tube was at least four feet wide and a very large man floated with a tube running up his nose. He looked like he could easily best any of the cast of ""My 600 lb Life"".

""It is. He's also the answer to our problems- well the proof that we can easily have the answer.""

""Explain it. Now,"" Michelle barked, her hands held the edge of a console in front of the tube as she peered into his third eye, the protruding belly button.

""We've discovered that human weight is just like mass in the universe only confined to the planet and perfectly allocated across small geographic areas.""

""Do better than that or Barack will press the green button on this place.""

""Well, he's the proof that in any given area only a total amount of weight can be had- he is our depository for extra pounds in the CDC. Every worker here as shed three pounds not through exercise but just by feeding him- stuffing him with burgers and beers and sometimes IVs of pure fat- well strawberry milkshakes but its the same thing. Whenever he is fed enough to physically increase in weight from one person, that person drops the exact same amount of weight,"" Mr.Niet;s voice became higher as his excitement grew.

""That could be a coincidence.""

""We tested for that,"" Mr.Niet pulled out a picture of a doctor Michelle didn't recognize- the man was at least one hundred pounds overweight. Mr.Niet pulled a video up on the console which had this doctor being weighed on a scale in the office and a depiction of his weight on one side of the screen and the act of him pressing a button over the course of three weeks. The doctor didn't know why he was pressing the button or that it was even a weight based experiment only that he needed to stand in a spot after pressing the button- according to the summary slide at the end.

""So we could have someone press a button a few times and lose weight just to give it someone else?""

""Yes and it appears its a ratio at first where you lose a pound and they gain a quarter pound but this scales up quite quickly. This is why we want to study individuals with eating disorders- we could both cure them and stop obesity."" Michelle stood up straight and paused; her knuckles lined up against her chin as she thought. This could be it, they were right. Half of all Americans could be healthier.

""Fine. Continue- but I was never here. Send the buttons to some side part of my Healthy Wayz campaign in California- we'll test it there. I'll have Barack draw up a few....permission slips to obtain donors."" Michelle left without Mr.Niet's escort.",WritersofRohan17

""Allow me to introduce myself: I am Death. Now that you have arrived in the afterlife, you will be granted the opportunity to ask me twenty questions, which I shall answer with the greatest degree of honesty you are capable of comprehending, before we proceed. You may start whenever you-""

Death bristled; he could see something that greatly unnerved him, but he wasn't certain yet as to what it could mean.

Joe, not cognizant of this, remained silent and considered his options.

""I get to ask you twenty questions?"" he inquired.

""Yes,"" Death replied with a hiss, whilst distracted with what he now identified as a presence.

""And you have to answer them as truthfully as you can?"" Joe pressed.

""It's not a matter of whether I can do it, but whether you are capable of understanding what I have to say,"" Death clarified, whilst gazing shiftily at the walls in search of an intruder. ""My knowledge is infinite. *Nothing escapes my gaze.*""

A look of realization swept across Joe's face.

""I... just asked two questions, didn't I?""

""Three, now,"" came Death's reply. He seemed to be growing more aggravated by the second. ""You really should be more careful with your words.""

""I'm sorry. Are you angry wi- actually, forget it. Can I just start over?""

""Sixteen questions left, now,"" Death growled. His eyes pierced around every object in his sight until they came to rest in one location.

""But can I?""

""*Fine! You have twenty questions left!*""

""Rea-"" Joe started, then reconsidered. ""I mean, what is the meaning of-""

""Hold that thought, Joseph,"" Death interrupted. ""I neglected to mention that the answers to more sensitive questions, particularly those related to the fundamental nature of existence, are to be shared with the asker only. Right now, however, a third party is listening in.""

""But I didn't-""

""Not you, Joseph. This isn't your fault. I'm talking about... *you.*""

Death is looking at you. Yes, you, dear reader.

""I stated before that I possess infinite knowledge. Did you think you could spy on me undetected? How *dare* you try to take the secret of life for yourself by viewing it in the form of a story? I *know* what you would do if I were to tell you.""

The walls were the first to disappear. Joe vanished soon after. One by one, the background elements and story features are erased from existence, leaving only Death's dire admonition.

""I know you're curious, but do try to restrain yourself.""

If a metaphysical construct capable of being interacted with through a text-based medium were capable of leaning forward, Death would surely do so.

"[WP] After death, you are allowed to ask 20 questions which will be answered with utmost honesty, completeness, and truth.",V_Tom,"""Twenty questions huh? Feels like the whole 'Genie emerges from the bottle grants three wishes thing'."" I shake my head. ""Trouble is, I can't think of any.""

The old tape recorder sits on the scuffed table in front of me. I can see the little dials turn the tape from one roll to the next. It's the only object in the room asides from the table and my chair.

I've already established that this is purgatory. Partly because this room fits what I had always imagined. Grey and hazy, like a badly focused black and white film, no windows or doors, no other soul to be seen. But more likely because that's how I wasted my first question.

""What happens if I don't ask any questions?"" I say, spending another question. I'm sure scientists, ideologists and all manner of educated people would be peppering the air with questions by now. But I never could be like them.

*Nothing.*

""So I'd be stuck here until all twenty are finished?"" I think I'm down to sixteen now.

*Potentially.*

I tug my earlobe. I've got to be the most vanilla-pudding bland person to ever die if I can't think of anything to ask. I sigh. I'm getting a headache and I don't even have a physical brain anymore.

""Have you got any suggestions?""

*Most people ask about relatives, their worldly possessions. Alternatively, some try to determine the origin of the universe, life or god. Really, we can answer any question. It's not so difficult.*

""Easy for you to say, you're not the one with sixteen more questions to waste."" I take a jab at the voice. I don't know what it is, or what it does, or how the tape recorder even catches its voice since I'm pretty sure this is all going on in my, ahem, head. ""What about you?""

*Excuse me?*

""Do you have any questions?"" Thirteen, this isn't so hard after all.

*Why would I have questions when I have limitless knowledge?*

""Exactly,"" I say. ""You see how hard it is?""

*But you do not have limitless knowledge.*

""That's not the point."" I counter, ""Questions aren't so easy are they?""

*Your logic is invalid.*

""Invalid or not, I'm not the only one here without questions, am I?""

*...*

I tilt my chair back to balance on its hind legs, letting the entity mull this over. I'm actually trying to think of a good question this time. It's actually rather fun, conversing this way. I chuckle.

""Is there such thing as a stupid question?""

*A question is a question. A person asks to seek knowledge. When someone seeks knowledge, how can they be stupid?*

""Aha! I knew it! I knew you'd have a question eventually!"" The chair slams down on the presumably concrete floor. The sound it makes is nothing short of silence. ""How was it? Asking the question?""

*You are incorrigible.*

""Tell me something I don't know. Wait,"" I feel silly for a second. As I'm saying this my 'hand' reflexively went up to pause the conversation, as if there were someone physically here with me. ""Don't tell me. Ask me.""

*Why did the human ask a question?*

""Is this a 'chicken cross the road' joke?"" I ask, all I get is silence. ""Or is this a trick question?""

*Why did the human ask a question?*

""You're serious?""

*Obviously.*

Dry. I've determined the voice is very dry. As if it gets hundreds of souls each day, each one being as obstinate and stubborn as me. As far as I know, time does not exist in purgatory, but I would probably get to be the same if it happened to me.

""Why?""

*Really, that's your answer?*

""Did you want a better one?"" I bristle at the judgement in its tone.

*How typical of you.*

I swear I just heard it sigh.

*Very well. The human was given opportunity to ask.*

""That wasn't a very good joke."" I tell the entity.

*It wasn't meant to be. Humor is a human concept.*

""Fine."" I tug my earlobe again. I'm thinking. Given the opportunity to ask, that makes sense, in a simplistic way. I smile.

[WP] Personal teleportation is now an app; no one could have foreseen the consequences.,rwogh,"After a few shocked heartbeats, thought returned. Now, I had to figure out what was going on.

I was standing in what used to be LeConte Hall. It was ruined, and not in the clean way that my house had been wrecked. It was just a pile of bricks now. I climbed over a slab of marble, making my way, slowly, towards the lawn.

There were still bricks and scraps of wood that used to be furniture scattered across the grass, but at least I could walk when I made it. I went some distance from the wreck, and turned around.

Dread hit my gut again. It looked like half of the building had been *dropped* on the other half.

Someone called out to me, and I noticed the crowd for the first time.

Students, mostly. They had gathered around the tragedy like social vultures. Most of them seemed more excited than concerned. Many had their phones out, recording the scene.

There were plenty of theories regarding the continued existence of handheld phones in a time when we could implant electronics directly into our brains. Mine was that the deep-set obnoxiousness and detachment of internet culture couldn't survive without them.

The video lenses gleamed on.

""Professor!"" the voice called again.

I turned to greet Molly.

""Thank god you're okay.""

She was preppy in a blue cardigan (against the frigid 60 degree weather) that matched her glasses. Her blonde hair was down, framing the light freckle dusting along her cheeks, which faded away as it approached the slender curve of her neck . . .

Not the time. I forced my gaze to stop falling, and looked her in the eyes.

""Fire department? EMS?""

""On their way.""

She had almost definitely been the first one to call them.

""What happened? Did you see it?""

She shook her head. ""No one saw it. I've asked everyone here.""

""Any talk?""

Another shake. ""A rumor about some 'secret experiment.' Probably unfounded.""

My heart dropped again.

""Professor, this is unfounded, right?""

 It must have shown on my face.

""Yes, yes, of course.""

On one end, the image of my house, bisected in Baltimore. On the other end, a vague memory. Hushed whispers of a government test in Pasadena. Something I wasn't supposed to hear, and had tried to forget.

""My guess is terrorism.""

""Terrorism?""

She nodded. ""It seems like a miracle that teleportation technology hasn't been used violently yet."" 

She was right. One press of a button, and you're in with a payload. Anywhere.

Dangerous thoughts.

I felt air displaced around me before I saw the men.

Three of them. Black suits, black ties, black glasses. Classic cronies, surrounding us. One grabbed Molly's arm, not gently, and began to move her away. The other two turned to me.

""Let go of her!"" someone from the crowd shouted.

""Professor Freeman, you need to come with us,"" one of the men said.

The crowd began to chant.

Molly would be alright.

I glanced around. One of the men was on my left, one on my right. If I turned to run backwards, towards the crowd . . .

The other man put a hand to his ear. 

""We're on your side,"" the first one said.

My house, secret tests, terrorism. What I knew and what I didn't know crashed in my mind, and I turned on my heel and *moved* towards the crowd. I was fast. I could get across the grass, and I could get through the students before they caught me.

After that? No clue.

One of the men cursed, and the telltale sound of a blazer flapping drew up behind me. I pushed harder against the ground. I spent lots of time in labs and classrooms and offices, but it would be a mistake to assume that I couldn't *run* anymore.

I reached the edge of the crowd. Students began to move out of my way, but too slowly. I planted my left foot to juke around a wisp of a boy that was stuck like a deer in ExtraBright LED GlareLights (those don't exist).

My foot slipped.

A pair of thoughts flashed in my head as it approached the ground. 

1: I was wearing dress shoes.

2: Fuck.

My skull knocked against a backpack, and I blacked out.

The headache hit me again, and I wanted to be asleep.

There was an icepack bound to my head. I was in a van, windows tinted too darkly to see. A man in a black suit sitting across from me offered me a pill. ""Take one of these, for your head.""

I remembered what had just happened, and I was glad that I was awake.

I moved to get up, but the other guy, the one sitting next to me, pushed me back down. The first one pulled out a taser.

""Relax,"" he said, ""and we won't have to use this.""

I nodded.

He nodded back. ""Now take the damn pill so that we can talk.""

I took the pill and dry swallowed. Guy 2 handed me a bottle of water. Little out of order, there. I winced, and took a drink.

Five seconds later, the headache was gone.

I started to unwind the icepack.

""No,"" Guy 1 said. ""The pain is gone, but it will still swell if you take the ice off.""

I left it on.

""Why am I here?""

Guy 1 grimaced. ""We apologize for the misunderstanding. We didn't mean to threaten you, but we miscalculated how you would respond.""

""I had friends in that building.""

Guy 1 nodded.

""Did you do it?""

""No,"" Guy 2 said, before I closed my mouth.

Guy 1 shook his head.

""Who did?""

""That's what we're trying to find out.""

So I knew that I could cross out ""government conspiracy."" If I believed the guys in shades.

Actually, knowing bureaucracy, I could only cross out ""government conspiracy from whatever agency these guys are from.""

""And who are you? CIA? FBI?""

""We're the people pick up the snowballs when they're just thinking about rolling, before they get too big to handle.""

What?

""I don't follow.""

""Snowball effect? Are you familiar with the term?""

I shook my head. I had heard of snow, but I had never seen it.

Guy 1 waved his hand. ""We solve really big problems before they become problems. While they still look like unconnected phenomena, little bumps in the road.""

I thought of Sebastian's reaction to my house.

""In this case, a house cut in half in Baltimore, ships disappearing off the coast of Tanzania, a SETI lab destroyed in California.""

""METI,"" I corrected instinctually.

""Whatever,"" Guy 2 said. I hadn't noticed his accent before. It sounded . . . Russian?

""Alright, great. You solve problems, so you can definitely figure out what the hell is going on. Why- ""

""We'd like to request your service,"" Guy 1 smiled, ""Sergeant.""

My mouth went dry. I opened it to speak, and closed it again.

""I thought -""

""These are extraordinary circumstances.""

How had they found me? I had changed my name to *Winston*. Who looks up that name in a military database?

""Your phone received a text from your friend Sebastian while you slept. He wants to see you. I took the liberty of answering. You're on your way to Palo Alto, to find out as much as you can about what's going on.""

""Is that where this van is going?""

""No. We'd like you to teleport there, if you agree to help us. The van is headed towards the airport. That's where you'll be going if you don't.""

""We're getting on a plane?""

He didn't answer. I couldn't even see his eyes.

""Destination?""

No answer again.

I waited for a few seconds, and turned to Guy 2. ""You don't talk much, do you?""

No answer.

""Fine,"" I sighed. ""I'll spy on my friends for you.""

Guy 1 smiled. ""Great."" The van stopped, and the door opened. No sidewalk, but I wouldn't need one.

[WP] Personal teleportation is now an app; no one could have foreseen the consequences.,rwogh,"Ever since the invention of teleportation, life had become much simpler. At first, teleportation was slow, expensive, and took a massive amount of electricity to do. It wasn’t of much use, because the cost of other transportation types was much lower. Then, they started to refine the technology. It took less and less energy with each iteration, until personal teleporters were finally affordable by average citizens. Anyone could walk into their own personal teleporter and walk out of any other one. 

This was as good as life could get, they thought. Because transportation of goods was no longer an issue, costs for everything went down. Since prices were down, more people could afford to live better and the homeless problem was all but eradicated. Fewer people went hungry, so fewer people had to steal to survive, causing the sharpest plummet in crime anyone had ever seen. 

Lowered prices meant more budget could be spent on different avenues, such as space travel. Soon, they began development of small ships that contained only enough room for a few crew, an engine, and a few teleporters. They sent several ships to each habitable planet within range, the teleporters on-board allowing the crews to switch out as they please and return to their families on Earth. When the ships landed on the planets, colonization began, and so, humans inhabited the stars.

Teleportation, the invention that solved world hunger, over population, and allowed ease of access to the stars, would soon be the downfall of all humanity.

Technology still advanced on Earth quickest of all as it was the oldest civilization, and so they developed the newest technologies first. They worked long and hard on teleportation, but couldn’t seem to break into the next step: teleportation to a coordinate, instead of from one pad to another. Many different models had been tried, but they all failed, until one day, they had a success. A junior scientist had accidentally discovered a way to teleport with no pad at all. Well, it wasn’t really “teleporting,” it was more of “flinging at high velocity through pseudo-space,” but teleporting sounded better to the marketers. 

The basics of how it worked: it first transported the subject out of the current universe, into one in which objects have no mass, then it applies a teensy, tiny push in the direction requested, enough to send you flying faster than light. After a certain amount of time, you reach your destination, and the device pulls you back into normal space. 

This was not common knowledge for the average citizen, if it was, they might not have accepted it so readily, and maybe humanity’s downfall would’ve been postponed.

Several devices were placed all around the globe that could accomplish this task of “teleportation” to a location, rather than to another pad. At first, they were only used for official business, such as taking ships further out than humans had ever gone before. Then, cruise ships were constructed to observe natural phenomenon light-years, light-decades, and even light-millennia away. 

“No distance too great” was the travel company’s slogan. If only they knew what it would bring.

Travel by this new form of “teleportation” was so popular, that more and more devices were constructed, until finally, you could download an app to your phone, press a button, it would send a signal to one of the devices and it would transport you anywhere in the universe. Automatically with your teleport, you get a “safety sphere” that pops around you when you arrive at your destination. All you had to do to get back is press another button, and it sends you back home. Distance became even less of an issue.

Through the decades of development of technologies such as teleportation, deep-space travel, and colonization of planets, crime had been nearly abolished. No one spent a single day in hunger or even discomfort. If they didn’t like where they were, they simply pressed a button and were whisked away into far-off lands. 

One day, an accident occurred with one of the teleportations. It was just one measly, little person who disappeared into the aether and didn’t return, but it caused an uproar. Teleportation accidents hadn’t been heard of for over a decade. So many safety devices and protocols were in place that no one had died from teleportation for so long. Investigations took place in order to find out what happened, but no one could explain it. Soon after that, another accident occurred, the equivalence of a bus full of school-children on a day trip to Beetlejuice disappeared. Another took place the day after when an entire building was scooped clean off the surface of Mars. Accidents continued to happen with seemingly random victims, but it wasn’t random. It wasn’t random at all.

It took weeks to discover the cause. Through their extremely fast advancement and development, humans had attracted too much attention from the other living beings in the universe. Even though they’d traveled to thousands of places all over the universe, there had been no signs of life on any other planet. It had been decided they were the only intelligent life, but they were wrong. These beings lived not in the universe humans resided in, but the universe humans used to travel between places. It took years for the beings to understand how humans were traveling in and out of their universe, and longer still to re-create it. Since these being were massless in their own universe, they were incredibly gigantic. One of them could encompass the entire solar system that Earth resided in. When their own began to die off through mysterious means, they investigated, only to discover miniscule beings popping into existence, piercing through them, travelling to distance space, and popping out of existence. 

To them, it was war. 

They began to pull in people and objects through into their space. They determined where the humans lived by “hotspots” in their own universe where space had become warped due to overuse. Eventually, they pulled in entire planets and destroyed them. Humans were on the defensive. By the time they discovered the true cause, it was too late. Too many research stations had been destroyed to find out how to prevent the beings from using their own technology against them. The beings were merciless in the destruction of the human race. They tracked down every last device whether it was destroyed or not, every human colonization, every last trace they ever existed was eradicated. They were extremely thorough.

And so, the war with the tiny, unnamed beings ended. For the rest of eternity, the other beings lived in peace.",Yulgalminakf
[WP] Personal teleportation is now an app; no one could have foreseen the consequences.,rwogh,"When I Tunneled back home for lunch, half of my house was gone. I don't mean that it felt like half of my house was gone, or that half of the stuff in my house was gone. Half of the actual, physical house just wasn't there anymore. Cut right down the middle.

There was a note on the half of the dining room table. I shifted so that I could read it in the sunlight (turns out that the circuiting doesn't work too well when everything is cut).

Yup. This was her ""taking her half."" Bitch.

I had no clue how she managed that. DigDug usually wouldn't allow a user to take anything too heavy with them. I supposed that I would find out more when the Newslets got ahold of the story.

Or, I could call Sebastian. He was on the team that had coded the damn thing. Or, he had been on the marketing team, once. He would know.

While my cell was ringing, I went over to the fridge (she had taken the freezer half), took out a frozen dinner (but she had moved all the frozen things to the fridge so they would melt), and put it in the microwave (she had left it in favor of the oven). I pushed the ""5"" button absentmindedly a few times before I remembered that the power was cut.

""Shit,"" I cursed just as Sebastian picked up.

""Hey, hey, my man,"" he began. He sounded like he wore Hawaiian shirts to work (hint: he did).

I groaned, picked out the frozen block of processed carbs wrapped in cardboard, and dropped it on the floor.

""Something got you down?""

""Yeah,"" I said as I stomped it into the ground. ""Mia just left.""

""Aw."" His voice dropped a few notes for sympathy, but it still sounded sleazy. ""Sorry to hear it."" 

""I spend my time trying to talk to goddamn aliens, yet I cannot understand that woman.""

""But she already told you it was gonna happen, man. Are you that torn up about it?""

I chuckled. Tiny bits of fettuccinne were beginning to fly loose from the packaging. ""Not that she left, no."" The package finally burst. ""But she took half of the house with her.""

""*What*?"" He dropped his relaxed drawl. The question was sharp.

""She took half of the house with her.""

""That can't happen.""

""It did.""

""Oh no."" I could hear him get up from a desk. ""That is not good. That is *not good*, Wince.""

""What do you mean?"" My voice wavered.

""Get out of there.""

""Of my house?""

""*Now*."" He hung up. Silence.

I waited for a few seconds, expecting something to happen. A bluebird broke the silence.

I opened DigDug. 

I hadn't closed the app since I Tunneled home, so I didn't have to wait through the intro animation. Instead I was greeted by a gently flashing blue circle, with the logo (a shovel with motion lines) sketched in sleek white lines in its center. No controls: the phone was tied into my INC. I only had to think of the destination.

I pressed the button, my heart skipped a beat, and I was back at Berkeley.

My heart skipped another beat. I felt a slow cold crawl into my stomach.

I was expecting the university. Instead, I arrived to wreckage.

[WP] Personal teleportation is now an app; no one could have foreseen the consequences.,rwogh,"Christ. 

The things I have done.

You'd like me to show you, wouldn't you, young man? Your imagination races only just ahead of your body's reaction. I can see it in the way your pupils widen, in the way your . . . Shit. I've lost it. Pupils widen . . . signs of arousal, what were they again? I was better at this when I was younger.

No, please. Don't. Not yet. Foolish to think that an old woman like me could persuade you like that. I should know better, but old habits die hard. The war got us all doing things we didn't think we'd ever do.

The things I've done, some of them were the things you're thinking. Most you couldn't imagine. Me, with my limp and my, um. You know. Shit. Fucking words.

Back in the war, I wasn't like this, you know. I was one of the elites. Zap in. Knives, guns, bombs, whatever it took. Then zap out again. No one the wiser, and the bad guys dead as dead can be. I won medals.  But the blood never comes out. It washes from your hands, sure, and you learn to dodge the arterial gush. But it stains something inside you. And that never comes clean.

We used to be America. And then the damn commies started in. Remember President Dumont, dying--no, of course you don't. Have you even started shaving yet? But Dumont, then Schroeder, then Kelvin Black, ran as a patriot and governed as a despot from his Faraday cage in the Oval Office. 

Until some patriot stuck a knife in him when he went to take a piss. I'm not saying it was me. But if it was, I would have done it because I had no choice *but* to do it. You know what I mean?

I don't know. Maybe you don't. But you're here, so maybe you do.

After the counter-coup, after Texas split off, and Oregon, and Jesusland . . . Christ, you would have been about five then, wouldn't you? You've never known anything but these divided states. We used to be great. We hated each other in abstract, but loved each other in person, and we were a *nation*.

Now? Now we're just marks on a map. 

And people like you, zapping in. Finding people like me. 

War criminal is just the name the winners give the losers, you know. We never thought of ourselves that way. We were patriots. True Americans. But I guess that wouldn't mean anything to you.

You sure I couldn't offer you something? I've forgotten more than your last five girlfriends know combined, I'm pretty sure. I used to be something.

No, I didn't think so. Too bad. I'm not ready for this. Not yet. 

Jesus, that thing is cold.

But I guess it'll warm up soon enough.

I'm going to sit down now, okay?  God, that hurts. It's like . . . it's like . . .

I don't know what it's like, I guess. Maybe when I was younger I could have --

I hope you don't. Come to this. Fifty years. From. Now.

[WP] Personal teleportation is now an app; no one could have foreseen the consequences.,rwogh,"I was talking about weekend plans with Mike when my phone pinged. A quick glance — ""Update error: Cannot update 'Jump'"" — and I got back to the conversation. Mike always had the best stories.

At the end of the day the error was still there. But the app was fine before, and I was not paying for a taxi — so I set it to home. Jump safety was strictly regulated, and any concerns caused app to lock down, which it didn't. As always, I tapped queue timer while it was counting seconds — tapping didn't make timer run any faster, but it felt as if it did.

I got home safe. But there was something unexpected — something in the app that have blinked for a moment before the timer hit zero. Something that seemed to react to my taps.

I have opened Jump again. Nothing different. I thought for a moment, then tapped the screen. Tap. Tap. Tap. On seventh tap, a new menu option. ""Developer Tools"". That was interesting. I checked the store page. There was no description for the update that failed on my phone, but it was released almost instantly after the previous one — did it remove Developer Tools?

In the menu were a few options I have never seen before:

1. Debug Data
2. Jump (unrestricted)
3. Replacement Data
4. Zero (Whairemaak)
5. Void 1
6. Void 2

The first option wasn't very interesting — statistics about the app usage and its internal diagnostics. The second option, on the other hand... From what I knew, long jumps were not possible at all, while cross-border jumps were blocked by the Jump Grid structure, following various immigration laws. I selected the option and saw two text fields — longitude and latitude (elevation was always automatic).

Of course I tried it. Who wouldn't? And suddenly I was in the streets of Bern — no timer, no delay, no intermediate nodes — a straight jump half a world away. I looked around nervously. But no one knew the length of my jump, so no one gave me more than a glance. Just in case, I hurried into the side street, and only then jumped again — back to my house.

I breathed deeply. That was obviously illegal, but I doubted anyone would hold it against me. It was tempting to do more — jump to all the far away places, see the whole world. But I was curious about the other options.

The third option made me call Mike. ""I need to talk to you, face-to-face"" I said, and in a few moments he agreed that I can jump over. ""What do you know about Jump?"" I asked. ""Same as everyone — app's by Nomae, they've built most of the Grid, they hold most of the patents."" ""Have you heard about anything called 'replacement' before?"" ""No, why?"" Mike looked at me with sudden attention.

I opened the third option.

Replacement Data looked similar to Debug Data, but it only included a few entries.

Rate (Global): 1.13%  
Acceleration: Low  
Estimated (this owner): 5 months  

""No idea"" said Mike. ""How did you find it?"" I explained about the update and tapping the screen. ""Probably the replacement stats for the app itself — when they need to force update or similar"" said Mike. ""Don't worry, coders always have some weird-ass terms."" He stood up, walked to the kitchen counter, and started the kettle. ""Have you tried the other options?"" ""Only first three, but was going to try others"".

Slowly, Mike turned to me. ""A mistake"" he said. His voice was wrong somehow, different. ""A correction."" There was a knife in his hand. Before I could consciously realize what's happening, I pushed the table, turning it on its side — and the knife went right into it, Mike losing his balance and falling.

I ran into the bathroom and locked the door inside. I could hear Mike standing up, getting his knife out. And Jump didn't work. Any destination gave the same message ""Jumping had been locked for safety reasons"". I tried ""Jump (unrestricted)"", but it gave me another error — ""Device locked out of the World Grid. Contact your administrator.""

I could hear Mike approaching, muttering something under his breath.

I choose ""Zero (Whairemaak)"". There as only one suboption, ""Jump"".

I jumped.

[WP] Everyone has a benevolent guardian angel that genuinely cares for their soul and helps them do good. Lucifer is one of them.,xprdc,"""Nope, not that one.""

""What? Dude, why not? She's hot.""

""*I'd* do her.""

""Oh. Point taken.""

Danny leans back on the bar and smiles behind his beer. Lucifer studies his face. He was handsome, for a mortal. He'd grown to be quite charming as well. Something had changed in him. Gone was the awkward 21-year-old who fumbled his driver's license on his birthday when the pretty bartender sweetly asked for some ID. The man standing in front of him was relaxed, and carried an air of quiet confidence. His dark hair, almost black, only added to his appeal. The girls at the end of the bar certainly thought so judging by their glances and giggles.

""What?""

Danny's voice snapped him out of his thoughts.

""Nothing,"" Lucifer stood up smoothly. ""Just thinking about the best way to murder everyone in here.""

Danny scoffed. ""You know, Lucy, for such a shitty angel, you'd think I'd have turned out worse.""

""Not on my watch,"" Lucifer grinned. 

Danny's eyes raked the bar and caught a petite blonde's gaze. His smiled widened, and Lucifer froze.

Lucifer stared intently at his young charge's eyes. This boy, who he had watched since birth. The reason he was on this mortal earth. And he picked up the ice pick from the cooler behind the bar, and plunged it into Danny's heart.


When the other angels arrived at the scene, Lucifer was just finishing up his scotch. One of them, some low-level desk angel fighting his way up to the guardian level, approached him. What was his name again? Scott?

""Damn, Lucifer, you certainly didn't pull your punch.""

Ethan, that was it. ""Nope,"" he said, and downed the rest of his drink.

Ethan bounced nervously, and then started to speak. ""So - what happened?""

Lucifer took a hard look down the bar at the blonde. She was crying on her guardian's shoulder, obviously traumatized by the events of the night. She would never know that Lucifer had saved her life before her killer had even come up with a plan to murder her.

Lucifer turned back to Ethan.

'Yes...but you see, she had help!  How was I supposed to know that the cursed meatbag had been training for 150 years to beat me?  I told YOU we made a mistake, showing them how to live so long!'

You know how the great Kon Ami wheedled us into their hearts and minds!  You have been taught how the blessed Nam'Co caught their imagination and drained their pockets!  And you let that proud heritage down by letting a HUMAN beat you?'

'But Nine, she cheated - she had help from one of the outcasts!  Remember that pompous splinter group? 'Naval Officers 64'?  One of their best coached her, over nearly a human lifetime!'

IX Tendo subsided a little.  Atya was old, old enough to remember the days when eyes and mouth had to be supplied - old enough to remember the legendary 8-bit soul.  Perhaps she could be given a little slack.  After all, they had ejected the 'Naval Officers 64' from the collective for unseemly obsession with that stupid game (and, Nine reflected, their unwillingness to download and the excruciating slowness with which they talked) and if '64' had had over a century to work with one of the humans, it might have given her some insights into a game that they had made their own, so long ago.    
     
'Well, Atya, maybe she did cheat; maybe the stories ARE true and there are humans who could beat us.  But we have evolved. We should not be beaten!  I will cover for you as best I can; I am sure I can keep it from Son Ying, as SHE respects age and wisdom. I dread to think what would happen should Tiny Limp ever discover that you were beaten; I am sure that you would be banished to where we found you.  Do you want to go back there?'

Joe knew this better than anyone. Sometimes, after a long day in the field, he'd come back inside and drink three whole bottles of water. (Joe was very healthy, and very fit.) 

But, after a lifetime of toil in his field to feed a nation, Joe needed a rest. He decided to take a break from his work, and let his children take care of the farm for a little while while he went to Spain.

Joe ran inside before the storm hit, but the storm followed him inside. Sitting down on the couch, Joe didn't really feel like farming anymore. He didn't feel like doing anything. He felt like there was nothing left inside of him.

The throng appears as if protesting, but to nothing. It is a reflex, born of quiet panic and stoic hope that it will all be alright shortly. So, many wait. 

As the shops later begin to close, the station announcer croaks into action a final time, there will be no more trains this evening ""we apologise..."". After that it doesn't matter what is said, it is an irrelevance. We have waited patiently, the weather has closed in and nothing was rectified. The hope was really trifling anyway, with no other options we could only wait. 
Now, that's gone, and we can't wait here. Some staff emerge to begin locking the gates, but we have to leave. People file out, there are some half-hearted arguments thrown their way. The fault lies nowhere here, but blame must be apportioned somewhere. 

Some try and find a hotel, £89 a night, £105, £120. Others head for somewhere open and warm, more trudge for a while, wondering what course of action to take, there are no buses to be had, the roads no longer an option either. Maybe the best option is to head back to work and wait for tomorrow.

"[WP] As a scientist, you're researching whether or not it's actually possible to smack someone so hard their ancestors will feel it.",Djd33j,"He sat across from me with his leg crossed over his lap and his arms flxed behind the chair. I glanced down at the paper again and read the opening line. I sighed.

Christ, why do I always get the weirdos? ""Mr Jeffreys, is this some sort of joke?"" I asked.

He sat up at that, took off his shades and stared me down with a look of sneering disgust. ""did you not read the research proposal?"" he asked, his disdain showing through as if the proposal explained everything.

""Do you expect me to take this seriously?"" I asked shaking my head incredulously, ""all you've written is some nonsense about physically harming someone's ancestors... I don't even know where to begin with this.""

He leaned forward suddenly until our faces were almost touching and whispered, ""Is. IT. possible. TO. smack. SOMEONE. so. HARD. their. ANCESTORS. will. FEEL. it.""

I looked down at his proposal again. His theory that pain transmits in reverse Mendelian patterns was just based on nonesense, and his methodology for testing the null hypothesis was just... cruel.

""Look."" I said, finally having enough. ""I think you are insane, and I want you to leave.""

This time he sighed. He stood up, picked up his bag, turned to leave, and then - WHAM - I was on the floor with a searing pain in my head so intense it felt like my skin was about to explode. Words failed me, I could only lay there and watch as he looked at me with hopeful eyes and said ""call me"" before planting something in my jacket pocket and walking away.

When I next awoke I was at the hospital, my wife at my side telling me that I'd suffered a serious concussion. As I begun to tell her the crazy day I had, she silenced me and told me as gently as she could that my mother was in a coma, admitted earlier today after claiming of a serious headache only moments before.

My eyes went wide at that, and after my wife left I reached into my pocket and pulled out the folded bit of paper that had been planted there. It was the research proposal. As I lay there in my confused state, I read and absorbed every single word of that utter nonsense.",localtoast127
"[WP] Heaven is for the elite. You, having just told a man about the benefits of flossing before being hit by a bus, have just arrived in Haven. Haven is ruled by the almighty Gosh. He greets you as you pass through the off-white gates.",Hovie1,"   ""We have a Denny's now."" 

   Herman was still holding his hands up near his face to better demonstrate the exact motion needed for optimal foodstuff removal. He felt as though he had had a bit of a headache, but that it had came and went almost instantly. More than that, Main street seemed a bit whiter and fluffier than usual. 

   ""I'm-- uh, I'm sorry?"" Herman blinked and dropped his hands.

   ""Oh! I was just letting you know that we just put in a Denny's down the way there past the Shop n' Stay.""

   ""Shop and stay... er, is the Fifth Street cleaners near here?"" Herman needed his suit after all. He had a big meeting this afternoon.

   ""Fifth street? Oh no, my boy, you must be somewhat confused. You see, you have just died, and are now meeting your eternal reward!"" 

   Herman blinked. ""Heaven... then you must be--""

   ""Gosh, yes.""

   ""...Gosh."" Herman was mystified. 

   Heaven was everything he thought it would be. Sort of. He glanced back at the pearly gates as he began walking to keep in step with the Lord, and couldn't help but notice a small chip near the bottom, like it had been scuffed a few too many times. They began treading down a street of pure... gold? Or copper maybe? He wasn't sure. Heaven seemed nice, in a budget travel sort of way. He caught whiff of a fishy smell in the air although there didn't seem to be a beach, and God was a bit shorter than he expected.

   ""So, my eternal reward. No more pain, no more suffering.""

   ""Eh, for the most part! Let me get you your welcome package, I have a pamphlet here that has an atlas of Haven, and inside this little pack we have some moist towelettes, a toothbrush, and-- you'll appreciate this-- mint-berry floss!""

   ""Um, excuse me,"" Herman interrupted, ""why am I going to need mint-berry floss, exactly?""

   ""You know,"" Gosh replied, cheerfully tearing off a string and mimicking Herman's earlier stance, ""regular flossing wards off gum-disease, and keeps your mouth feeling fresh!"" He dropped the bit of floss and it rolled away in the breeze. ""And right here I have the key to your apartment! Right up the stairs inside this building here, number 24C.""

   Gosh pressed the welcome package and the key into Herman's moistening palm.

   ""Forgive me, O Lord...""

   ""Gosh. There's no need for such formality here.""

   ""Oh... uh, forgive me... uh, but I thought Heaven would be a bit more... Utopian? Eternal bliss, and all that? No more gum-disease?"" He held up the box of floss.

   Gosh laughed. ""OH! I see, you think you're in Heaven! Oh that is funny. That is a knee-slapper, indeed.""

   Herman was sweating profusely now. The revelation that he wasn't in Heaven caused his stomach to drop.
    
   ""So this isn't Heaven? But if this isn't-- and I'm not-- then you must be--""

   ""Gosh, yes."" 

   ""Gosh... gosh... Well I'll be damned.""

"[CW] Life between two people who have fallen in love, but come from two completely different backgrounds without a common language to help them communicate.",P403B3,"How do you describe something as fleeting as love?  You have never felt it, child, so it would be like describing color to a blind man.  You will find it, in time. To be honest, it's curious that you're even asking... as young as you are.

And yet, you have asked.  So I will answer.

Love is often described as a completion.  Two imperfect parts, with jagged edges and soft ones, with large holes and small dimples, with bright colors and smudges; these two parts, so wonderfully incomplete, are put together to make one final whole.  A perfect union that fulfills one while the other fulfills the first.

It's rubbish.  That kind of thing works in the fairy tales, in the legends or the stories old wives weave when they're feeling the aching feeling of settling.

Here's the truth: when you fall in love, it's for all the wrong reasons.

Let me explain.  We talk about the perfect woman, or the perfect man for someone.  Some say they want someone with humor, others say they want success -- they say they're looking for a series of characteristics.   Looking for a counterpart that makes them comfortable, or happy, or fulfilled or whatever.

Love -- *true love* -- is not the filling of a resume.  Love is not about checking boxes or the right answers to the wrong questions.  

Love is unexplainable.  It's a draw, an *attraction* that stems from nowhere.  Let me put it this way; it's a lot like the ocean during a storm.  It's turbulent.  Loud, confusing, *powerful* and awe inspiring.  You cannot see where the storm starts or where it ends.  The waves seem to rise up from nothingness, and grow and grow until they look like they threaten to swallow the world.

There's a feeling there, *here* in your chest.  It's fear, but not of malice, for the ocean does not harbor hatred, greed or desire.  It's fear from respect.  Fear of the unknown.  The ocean, like love, simply... is.  In all its power to destroy, it is beautiful.

That is love.  It's a feeling, an emotion that draws you to someone.  It's whiteout for character flaws, it's explanation for shortcomings, it's invisible forces that can be felt across a continent.  

That is what I felt when I first saw your grandmother.  We spoke a different language, we had a different culture, we were from another *world*.  And yet something immeasurable brought us together.

A fire in our bellies flared to life when we first made eye contact.  There was attraction, yes, but it was more than that.  It was the way she laughed, the way she smiled, the way she looked to the left when she was trying to think of a word just beyond her grasp.  Seemingly insignificant things that hold more value than they have any right to.

And love is kind.  Love is patient.  There were times when the reality of our lives made things far from wonderful.  We fought.  We bickered.  We grew angry with one another.

But it all passed, because of the unexplainable force that is love.

You cannot see it.  You cannot measure it.  You can't define it.  It's as elusive as the hard features of a tumultuous ocean; the second you think you have it, it's crashes in on itself and starts again.

You will know it, in time.  But do not search too hard, it seems to appear from the most unlikely of places.

Come now, dinner is almost ready.  You smell that?  Grandma has made her world famous Alfredo.  Have I told you the story of her first chef job?  It's a good one.  It's even better when she's in the room: you get to see her face turn red at all the good parts.",Kaycin

"[CW] Life between two people who have fallen in love, but come from two completely different backgrounds without a common language to help them communicate.",P403B3,"Just like all the others, she accepts both the rations and the water bottle without saying anything. She crosses her legs where she sits on the floor and hunches over the little foil package that the rations come in. She gets it open just fine. I thought her fingers would be too slick to get a grip, but apparently they're more sticky than slick.

I shake my head and look away. Right, right. I'm passing out food to our guests. Or perhaps it would be more accurate to call them our charge. They are a colony of approximately two hundred individuals, and according to our scans so far, they are the only lifeforms on this jungle planet any larger than a trilobite. It's clear that this is not their homeworld, but we don't know how they got here. Some of the crew thinks it was a failed colonization attempt. Some of the crew thinks they're criminals in exile, left here to rot. But regardless of who they are, not to mention the fact that neither party knows any of the other's language, they seemed willing to come aboard. And now we have two hundred frog-alien people on board the *U.S.S. Trailblazer*, sitting here in the cargo hold and munching on rations while our medical crew keeps watch. They are humanoid, like me, but with smooth, moist green skin. Their faces are long and wedge-shaped, like those of lizards. This one in particular has big blue eyes. I keep thinking about her eyes.

Augh, and I still haven't resumed my job! I hurry down the aisle, instinctively muttering an apology to the next alien down the line for the wait, even though I realize he doesn't know what I'm saying. Or maybe he can deduce from my hushed tone and body language that I feel guilty for the mistake. I don't know. They're certainly sapient, we know that much. They speak to each other just fine. Most of them came wearing a skintight uniform of some sort, in various states of cleanliness and repair. Those who didn't had clothed themselves with large jungle leaves.

Come to think of it, I'm not even sure if that one with the big blue eyes is a female. Why did I think that? They're not mammals. Their chests are flat. Their genitals are internal. But I *feel* like she's a girl. Maybe because she's one of the slimmer ones? No, I'm probably just being an idiot. Onkai don't fit the ""girls are smaller"" mold, after all, and I should know that by now!

I finish my rounds. Hmm. Do I have time to linger before the crew needs me for something else? Sure, I can spare a minute. I walk back to the girl with the big blue eyes. ""Hey,"" I say as I sit down cross-legged in front of her.

She looks at me. I imagine she is confused about my giving her special attention. ""J'la,"" she says. I don't know what that means, but it would make sense for it to be some sort of return greeting.

What to say? I can't just launch into small talk. The only words we managed to figure out when we found them down on the planet were everyone's species' names. Human (that's me). Onka. Dubina. And these new guys said something like ""jior-go-wan."" Jorgoan, people are saying now. It might be a dumb thing to do, but linguistic reinforcement is all I can think of to do with this girl at the moment. I point at her, and then I gesture to the rest of the cargo hold with a circular motion, indicating her and her comrades all together. ""Jorgoan,"" I say.

She blinks her big eyes at me, and then she points to me. ""Hyumin.""

""Yep. Human."" I lean forward and press my palm to my chest. I emphasize the motion to make sure she knows I'm talking about me, this guy right here, not my species. ""Jim,"" I introduce myself.

She blinks again and then tilts her head. ""Jim?""

""Jim.""

And then, of all things, I see a smile creep up the sides of her salamander snout. My heart does something weird and fluttery in my chest when I see it. Then she places a hand on her own chest. ""Klarí.""

So her name is ""clah-ree,"" unless I heard wrong. ""Klari.""

She flicks her snout to the side. I'm not sure if that's a yes or a no--it looks more like a no, but I shouldn't assume--but regardless, she indicates herself again. ""Klarí,"" she says again, but she emphasizes the stress on the second syllable this time.

My bad. ""Kla-*rí*,"" I correct myself.

""Sa!"" Her eyes light up happily. I think I got it right. ""Klarí. Jim.""

I feel myself smile back. My face feels warm. God, those *eyes*. I can't get over how big and sparkling and blue they are. I want to tell her her eyes are pretty, but I don't know how to convey the notion of ""pretty."" Maybe I can come close. I raise my hands to my face and point to both of my eyes. ""Eyes,"" I say.

She raises her arms to mirror me and points to hers. ""Aiz,"" she says. Good, that was an obvious enough gesture.

I falter when I realize it's going to be hard to talk about color. Pointing to an object generally means the object. But I have to try. What's something brown, to match my own eyes? My gaze lands on the half-eaten nutrient bar in her lap, still in its foil wrapper. I point to it. ""Brown.""

She looks down at the food. I imagine she is confused as to why I started talking about it. She looks back at me. ""Braun?""

""Yes, brown. That's brown food."" I point to my hair. ""Brown hair."" Then my eyes again. ""Brown eyes.""

I really hope that worked. She's staring blankly at my face. ""Braun aiz,"" she mutters.

""Yes. Brown eyes."" I point to my shirt. ""Blue."" I gesture to her. ""You...blue eyes.""

She blinks. Then she points to her own eyes again. ""Bluu aiz?""

""Yep! Blue eyes. Very pretty blue eyes."" I freeze after the words spill out of my mouth. Did I just say that out loud? Those words weren't part of the lesson! I hope I didn't just confuse her. Or incriminate myself. Is any of the crew still around? I look around the cargo hold. No, no one here that I can see--

A touch on my hand. I nearly jump. When I look back to her, she's eyeing me with an expression I can't place. It seems earnest. Her hand is still on mine. I look down at it. It is a soft, moist spring green. Five fingers, like me. But the fingers are longer, with sheer webbing between them. But she pulls her hand away a moment later. Of course. She's gotten my attention, so she doesn't need to do that anymore. I hide my disappointment. Wait, disappointment? Since when was I disappointed?

""Vei riddi?"" she says.

Augh, I wasn't paying attention. ""What?""

""Vei riddi bluu aiz. Jor tanak'li.""

Pretty sure I have no idea what that last bit was, but the first part sounded like… ""Very pretty blue eyes?""

""Sa. Vei priddi...na jalúk?""

If she's asking me what ""very pretty"" means, I'm not sure how to put it. My cheeks are burning. This is not good. What have I done? ""Um."" I bite my lip again. ""Pretty. Pretty is...nice."" Maybe a smile? I smile at her and ball a fist against my chest. I'm trying to think of how to convey that something makes me happy. That's the best idea I have. ""Pretty.""

She blinks. Then her expression changes. She looks...troubled? No, that's not right, but I'm not sure how best to put it. ""Yuu...braun aiz,"" she says. Then a smile, a soft smile, creeps up the sides of her snout again. ""Vei priddi braun aiz.""

Logic tells me that she's only imitating me. She can't know for sure what those words mean. But regardless, my stomach does a somersault. 

Klarí nods to herself. ""Chenno tavi khorri."" Is that...is the green in her face darkening a bit? I wonder if that's the Jorgoan version of a blush. ""Jor chenno tavi khorri selaka."" She pulls back after she says it, whatever the hell she just said, and raises her hands (shyly?) to her face. Her smile's gotten bigger. Why do I get the impression she just said something really embarrassing?

""Yo, Jim. We need your butt up on the bridge.""

I whip around. That's Roc calling me from the door to the cargo hold. Crap, I really need to get going. ""I'm coming."" I look back to Klarí. ""See ya, Klarí,"" I say automatically, and I push myself to my feet. I start walking.

""Taglé, Jim.""

My gait falters. I figure she was just wishing me a similar goodbye, and yet my body has decided to react with a tingly feeling in my stomach. I pick my pace back up. We can talk later. Maybe I'll teach her some more words. Come to think of it, I should probably try to learn a few of hers. *Jor chenno tavi khorri selaka.* Maybe she was giving her language's version of the ""pretty blue eyes"" thing.

[WP] In your lifetime you have attained near infinite cosmic power.

I'd been happily baking away in this little pocket of space and time that I'd made, watching the eggs rise with a look of absolute glee and then...

A Kanarian once tried to teach me how to make a local delicacy. I'd stopped in, just a weary traveller replete with battle scarred scales on my skin (don't ask, I was going through an insect phase), and I asked the bartender to tell the chef to go wild. To make the most amazing dish he could.

This was a bar that attracted two types of customers: the dead and the soon to be dead. Definitely not a nice neighbourhood. The chef came storming out and asked who the wise ass was. Asked might be the wrong word, seeing as how he didn't have a grasp on verbal communication. Lots of chairs went flying, that's a closer description.

Two hours later, after much structural reconstruction (by yours truly) and an even larger payment to further entice the chef, I sat and I ate it. It. Like calling a civilisations god ""her"". To do it justice I would have to cut out your tongue and rake it over the entrails of a thousand cesspits before holding your favourite meal on a silver platter.

I cried and I orgasmed and I ate it, bit by heavenly bit, as the chef watched through all his eyes. And in that moment I came to the realisation that no cake I could possibly make would ever surpass this delight.

I killed the chef. One minute he was there, short cilia folding over each other, and the poof. Gone.

If I could never make a cake that beat him, then I would ensure only one other thing in my Universe. That no one else would else would ever get to taste it.",Dachande663

""Oh sweet"" Krayviem replied and after a pause ""I like it alot, pleasingly abstract and it has a fun sound to it; 'Country Fresco' "" 

""Thank you"" replied Country ""I only let go of my Catagory 8 name a week or so before I met you so I'm going to be trying out quite a few in the next while"" 

""I'll look forward to hearing them and well, I'll leave you to your 21st century fascination as I just came over to say a bunch of us are catching the Mag to Korea 10 cycles from now, hope you'll decide to come along""

After watching Jamble roll away Country refocused on the hologram and it solidified in his perception, the options menu flashed up and he deftly dialed the breadth of perspective up after the interruption had killed his immersion and then motioned resume. 

[*]American destabilisation of volatile African states and the deamonising of the local combatants was shortly followed by a collapse of hard won civil rites laws for blacks in America, accelerating the collapse into martial law and the erosion of civil liberties and privacy. []]

It wasn't the same, he'd predicted this outcome from results in his previous simulations and really his mind was back with Jamble.

He clicked his 3rd finger on his left hand and after a few gestures a fine golden thread lit up off to his left guiding him to his destination. He turned and began his journey to the Mag boarding-gyroscopes and queried the time left to the 10th loop since the moment of his conversation, stops, and takes a turn to follow the freshly updated route.

He steps into the personal transporter the golden thread terminates at and sitting comfortably he speeds off along Peruvian solar roads, editing camera angles on his latest animation work, 5 minutes to the Mag, 50 minutes to Korea.

[WP] The Islamic State is wiped out by a totally unexpected country in a totally unexpected way.,chinli,"They laughed at us for years. 

Damn things made us into the laughing stock of the whole world. We tried to keep it a secret, and for a while the world had just forgotten it happened. Then came the internet, and with it, millions of people with too much time on their hands and the sum total of the world's information at their fingertips. They found it, found our country's greatest shame and shared it with everyone.  Repost after repost of the same damn thing over and over again, the whole world laughing at that tarnish on our proud military history.

Well whose laughing now ya cunts ? We told ya everything on this Island'll killya.
We got snakes, spiders, spiders that eat birds, snakes that eat spiders that eat birds, birds that'll attack in huge clouds that blot out the sun, and the bloody dropbears always waitin for ya. Ya think we're not accustomed to clearin out wildlife ? Ya think we're not the best in the world at takin out dangerous animals ? 

But those ones.... all of ya cunts laugh because you don't know.... haven't seen what we've seen..... the deadliest animals of all. They move like the wind, they can dodge machine gun fire like nothin you've eva seen. I say they's posessed, and if you'd ever stared into their cold unblinking beady eyes you'd say the same.

We've been waitin years for the opportunity to show the world, to show them THIS IS NO LAUGHIN MATTER ! But we knew it was too unsafe, too immoral to unleash these horrendous beasts on anyone. We quietly kept it to ourselves, swallowed our pride as the world laughed at us, and did our best to keep the animals placated and calm, least they unleash their fury on our innocent countryside once more. 

But now we found a target, a people so unrelentingly horrendous we'd be immoral not to let em' have it. We'll let the whole world see what we faced on those grim days out in the brush, let the whole world watch as one pack of horrible animals devours and consumes a pack of horrible mindless barbarians.

No one will be laughing at us then, we'll show the world !

Domino and other pork industry leaders banded together to form the WPC (Weaponized Porcine Coalition) to finish the job Emperor Trump was unable to. 

Within weeks of the pigs' insertion into enemy territory, IS forces and their allies had been unable to make a stand against the insatiable appetite of the ever reproducing evil hogs. With the hogs decimating the crops throughout the Middle East, IS had to decide weather or not to eat pork or to remain clean in the eyes of Allah and face starvation. Given the intelligence Allah bestowed upon his holy fighters, they chose starvation immediately.

[WP] The Islamic State is wiped out by a totally unexpected country in a totally unexpected way.,chinli,"...of course reports continue to come in from all parts of the Middle East where ISIS had previously been active. Simply astonishing. Once again, for those of you just tuning in, the tiny Himalayan nation, the Kingdom of Bhutan, in a shocking and completely surprising move, last night launched multiple, simultaneous, and thoroughly devastating strikes against ISIS across multiple time zones, and in scores of locations. The international response has been universal shock and awe. The tiny country, located between China and India, known as having the Happiest People in the World on the World Happiness Index, was previously thought to have only a small defense force, and that it mainly relied on the good will of its neighbors for security. All of that changed last night as the, again, *tiny* mountain nation, roughly the size of Massachusetts with a population of around 750,000 apparently happy people, was revealed to have been concealing a highly advanced, and enormously capable military force that at around 8 o'clock GMT last night utterly annihilated what appears to have been the entire organization previously known as ISIS. Again, ISIS was defeated in a coordinated series of attacks by Bhutanese special forces, and the previously unheard of Bhutanese Air Force, or possibly their Navy. Why a landlocked, Himalayan country would have a navy, experts aren't sure, though at this point anything seems possible when it comes to the sheer lethality of what had previously been assumed was an honor guard for the royal couple. ""Out of friggin' nowhere! I've never seen anything like it!"" Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joseph Dunford was quoted as saying. Also, we have reports from the ground describing attacks as ""spontaneous"", ""surgical"" and, again, ""utterly devastating"". ""We can't find anyone alive. No prisoners were taken. Every single ISIS operative is dead everywhere we go"" one unidentified US Navy SEAL was quoted as saying. He went on - ""We thought we were kidnapping a hidden, high-value asset, but when we got to the house everybody had been shot in the face"". There have been no civilian casualties reported, and no casualties reported whatsoever since this morning, although the death toll for ISIS continues to rise as coalition forces now become clean-up crews after an amazing series of strikes by the Bhutanese military, again, last night lasting until early this morning. The United Nations has stated it will withhold comment until there has been a clear assessment of what exactly happened. NATO representatives made a similar assertion adding that ""we are cautiously optimistic about what appears to be the sudden, and total defeat of ISIS. At the same time we are, of course, quite curious about the capabilities of the Bhutanese military. We have a delegation hoping to meet with their people very soon."" Again, if you are just joining us, the Kingdom of Bhutan, in an unprecedented show of military force, defeated the organization known as ISIS, or ISIL. Doesn't really matter now, does it? (laughs) Uh ... this just in, the King and Queen of the tiny - *tiny* little Himalayan nation of practicing Buddhists, the royal couple has just now issued a joint statement. We have it here: ""Greetings, friends! Bhutan truly has the friendliest, and the happiest people in the world! Please come and visit our beautiful, modestly sized mountain nation. Visit our website to learn more! Learn why it's called 'the Land of the Thunder Dragon' - oh wait!

""Is it still hot?"" He asked over the sounds of the rotor blades.
""No,"" his colleague replied. ""No activity for several days, in fact.""

The major said nothing and continued to study the quickly approaching city as the helicopters sped forward. No one said a word as theh flew over the carnage of Raqqa; as far as the major knew, similar scenes of destruction were all over the Islamic State's former sphere of influence. 

The major's helicopter broke off from the group and began to orbit the landing zone. Finding an acceptable place to land, it began to hover over a patch of clear ground, and the ropes went out.

Radio chatter indicated that the other helicopters were dropping their soldiers and were now taking up orbital paths around the area of concern. The major paid it no attention. He made the order to insert his team.

A single tuft of dark brown hair peeked out beneath her clothes.

""This is just a western imperialist trick to eat away our convictions from within, with these distractions.""

""But sir...this is Japanese."" At this, the officer froze, caught between rapid oscillations of having an aneurysm and actually taking this answer seriously. He reached down to take one of the many booklets, and flipped to a page.

""Explain this and how this has anything to do with us."" The soldier looked down. This time, Islamis-tan was being whipped, and yet the blush of her cheeks and the rapturous look in her eyes showed her pleasure at the hands of a religious man.

Brooks had just smoked out the entirety of the Middle East with what he called the ""danks."" How he was able to get over 1,000 pounds of marijuana to the Middle East from New Zealand has been a point of controversy. Many officials are still trying to decide whether to give him a medal or a sentence. 

""Give him the death sentence!"" bellows the Saudi representative ""cut off his legs! Stone him to death!"" 

""Suh dude, maybe you need a hit of this shit"" Brooks giggles as if his comment had any comedic merit.

The recon team leader scanned the horizon some more.  The wind wasn't coming directly from the city, so the smell was being carried from somewhere else, but from not too different a bearing.  He turned his gaze toward where the wind was blowing from.

He saw it.  A great white mass off to the distance, with darker specks interspersed.  The white mass seemed to move.  Wait, what?  He looked through his riflescope.  Sheep!  What were sheep doing there?  He moved his scope off to the left a bit, then put it down and sat down, stunned.

""What is it, sir?""

A third of my countrymen, family and friends gone in one bright flash; like God's finger reached down from Heaven removing the pieces from a life-size game board. 

Before the bombs fell, we were farmers. After The Flash, we became survivors. We didn't know about radiation or fallout. There were no shelters, food stores or stockpiles for us to fall back on. 

When our last goat died and my father's hair began falling out he took me with him to Ramadi to search for other survivors. All that waited for us was a field of glass - Trinitite, a term I would learn much later. I buried him with the remains of my faith, on the edge of the desert, where the sand had began reclaiming the war ravaged trade city.  

Without water I wandered, delirious, for days with nowhere to go. The sand played tricks with my mind. Visions of the prophet called to me. He promised me peace, relief from my suffering and a place with him beside my father if I would accept him back into my heart. But I had seen enough of what the Gods offer and the hatred in my heart left no room for their lies and empty promises.

I was found half covered in sand, skin blistered and burned. My nurse, a woman I could have loved in some other life, recalled my lips were so dry, stretched so thin across my face, she could see bone between the cracked skin. 

Their caravan had negotiated the wastes from the North, through Turkey. Their leader, Shaytan, traded wealth for supplies and made it His mission to rescue as many survivors as He could. The others spoke highly of his deeds. With almost preternatural ability they followed him across the sands, rescuing the living, burying the dead. 

It wasn't much longer before the first airdrops arrived. With the supplies and freshwater came European newspapers. We would gather together, mostly at night beneath the stars and Shaytan would read to us. 

On the first night he began, ""The world comes together to condem the actions of North Korea. Although the rogue nation has succeeded in the process of refining the plutonium isotopes necessary to build a nuclear bomb they continue to lack the necessary propulsion technology to reach their enemies in Europe and the United States. As evidenced by what the failed state is calling a 'display of the power of their Supreme, Glorious Leader' it is still uncertain whether the bombs were meant to strike the Middle East, or if they simply malfunctioned on their way to other, higher value, targets..."" 

I would stay on and become a man with this group. Shaytan's only law was that no man or woman may come to praise any God. He claimed no being worthy of worship would forsake their people in such a way as we had suffered. He would clothe us, feed us. When the radiation returned in the children of those who dared to try beginning families it was Him who comforted us. 

It was Shaytan who trained us, and equipped us. He taught us of our new enemy, their strengths and weaknesses. Without family or future He became our common bond. A leader for a new revolution. Godless, sinless, we wage our war against the yellow man who took our lives from us. We do these things for His glory, in homage of the man who saved us.

And besides that, the by product of their industrialization are the adoption of American culture which eventually leads many North Koreans stops in trusting the myth of their supreme leader ancestry.

[WP] The Islamic State is wiped out by a totally unexpected country in a totally unexpected way.,chinli,"While Pope Francis I has been spreading his agenda of world peace and comparatively liberal views, Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI has been busy at work in a secret Vatican workshop.  There, the retired holy father was working on his master plan: the total destruction of IS.

Francis went without the luxuries of his predecessors, a true pope of the people.  But this was just an act.  Benedict had been secretly auctioning Papal luxuries off.  Swelling the already brimming coffers of the Vatican.  With so much money, the Pope was able to fund an extraordinary research program:  The creation of a gigantic weaponized robotic Jesus, whose very footsteps would send seismic tremors through the ground.  The creation was armed with a whip fit for a roman scourging, and combined this with a glorious booming voice: ""repent"" *crack* ""repent"".  Jesus would bear no cross as his burden is the elimination of each and every last IS heretic.  

Under the cover of darkness, the 500-foot graven image began his journey from the vatican to Syria using the most direct route.  It travelled through the mediterranean sea, bringing terror to the hearts of fishermen who believed that armageddon had begun.  With red glowing eyes and a halo of fire, cracking the crests off of waves with its whip of repentance, the robotic lord inspired the recitation of many hail marys and our fathers.

The son of man entered the holy land through Nazareth and Galilee, carving a path of repentance as the Jewish looked on in utter disbelief.  Israeli missile defences automatically sprang into action, but proved ineffective against vatican anti-missile systems, which consisted of confiscated copies of 'the watchtower' which acted as chaff.  The incineration of this Jehovah's Witness propaganda brought a smile to the robotic personification of the Roman catholic church.  But the Israelites, god's chosen people, were not the primary target.  The infidels of IS were closing in.

The battle would rage for 40 days and 40 nights, and in the end the robotic monolith was in ruins.  But so too was the foundations of Islamic Extremism.  Pope Benedict emerged from within the ruins of robot Jesus, fanning himself with the Koran.  The heavens themselves opened before him as he ascended, and every last person in the middle east was converted to christianity.  

""Wow!  What a dream!""  A smile was on Benedict's face as he woke up in his bedchamber, and started another day in the simple life of a retired pope.  ",xdcs

[WP] The Islamic State is wiped out by a totally unexpected country in a totally unexpected way.,chinli,"I always assumed Ninjas were based in fiction. I assumed they were in the ranks of Santa Claus and the Easter bunny. 

But on August 5th, they were undeniably real. The slaughtering began on August 1at. A man named Alfa was killed in Montana outside a mosque. It was only after his death that police discovered his ties to radical terrorists and ultimately ISIS. 

I just graduated from Montana State and was working as a forensic assistant. my director bluntly said ""I don't care much for all these towel heads. So you take care of this one"". I was disappointed with his prejudice but happy to take on my first case. What was really strange was the depth and width of the stabbings. A knife wouldn't be that wide or precise through human flesh. A sword would have pierced through. And the only other thing that fit the shape was a... it couldn't be.. but I alerted the police that we would be looking for a man using ancient Japanese throwing knives.

Over the next few days, there were a series of similar victims on the tv. It was filled in the news. Muslim's killed with shallow and wide wounds. Part of me grieved with the victims. but my nerd side was excited by the idea of a group of ninja assassins serving justice with throwing knives.

I made my mistake on August 3rd. I was trolling some anti-Muslim's in a chat room. I'm no Muslim but I can't accept the unfair attitudes some share for them. Regardless they showed up at my door. Eighteen of them in my apartment. rItualistically standing around my bed while I slept. I woke up as one dragged a knife across my cheek and spoke in a foreign language Thayne's definitely not Japanese. I was terrified and could not produce a sound.

Another man interjected with very strong English and stated: ""seahawks3657 we, the brotherhood are here to serve judgements. you are a member of the legion of evil and an enemy of Egypt. Do you have any last words?"". I pleaded and cries that I wasn't. I told them that I supported peaceful Islam and that I wasn't a part of that awful group. they clearly didn't believe me as their looks were cold and definite.

I heard footsteps and a large man emerged wearing red. I couldn't see the ninjas faces but they flashed each other a surge of looks and droppedntheir heads and bodies immediately. this was the boss of the outfit. He spoke with perfect English. ""Stand up young man"". I complied. He asked ""do you know how to operate a video camera"". I nodded. He smiled and said ""come, so have work to do""

To this day, I still don't know their motivations or how they were able to amass over 1 million trained ninjas.  Or, how they were able to find me or all the groups in the middle east but they were confident and sneaky and effective.

The first wave was a gas station in Kabul. They were underground guarded by light machine guns and turrets. We were disguised as passerbys. When we were pumping gas, they dropped smoke bombs around the car and dragged me as we feed. The Isis members slowly approached the cars and the throwers hit each of them in the back of their head with the throwing knives dead center, 7 men were immediately down. The man on the turret was shooting everywhere and an alarm was ringing. One of then ninjas managed to get behind him and cut his neck with a knife. So much bloodshed...

We used their guns to break the door to the basement. I asked why they didn't use them on the incoming men and the head stated ""it goes against our code"".

When we reached the last level, they held me back. rOlled and threw their knives to the wall and the whole room was in flames at a moment. there was no escape for the terrorists. We walked away proudly as the scene of the gas stations erupted into flame and smoke with an explosion.

We continued on the campaign for a week. I was always surprised how quiet and effective they could be.  My group wiped out 50 Isis safehouses. By August 12th. There was no sign of our presence except bodies of Isis soldiers.

We has cured the world of its cancer. 

The man told me ""good job"" and I never saw him again. I never saw ninjas again. I had 150 hours of blood and murder and I didn't know what to do. the rush and excitement of the action was gone. 

Two days ago, I woke up to the same scene in my bed all those years ago. 18 men in my bedroom. They asked me if u had shown the tapes to anyone. I said no and they basked ""why not?"" And left immediately

Now I'm not sure what to do with them. I saw evil exorcised from the world. I still don't know the how's and why. I'm not aurenhow the world would react to this other secret super power. Comparable to that of an army in size and effectiveness. I'm just not sure.",turndownfortheclap

As am extremely religious entity, nobody thought, ISIS is predictable. Nobody decided to use their core, religion, as her weapon.

She created an arsenal of weapons forged with an extra ingredient, pork. Bullets, guns, knives, you name it. Eat or touch pig carcass stay in hell.
 
She created an all-female militant operations squad. Be killed by a woman in battle, no heaven and no 72 virgins.

She worked with municipal, ally government officials, and began building orphanages on all of the past and would be future battle grounds. Consume an orphan's wealth, stay in hell.

Attempt to strategically end each battle with air-support. Those that desert their brethren in battle stay in hell.

**The last, and final but most vital tactic**, was awareness. Awareness of these ""hell-guaranteed tactics"" to be common knowledge to all ISIS members. 

So she teamed up with James Franco and Seth Rogan and made a wildly famous and viral movie about her plan.

Duke of Edinburgh and Consort of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. At first merely a captive of political significance (at least to those ignorant of British politics), that is until the island nation of Tanna got wind of it.

""To the Islamic State."" The recording was sent to the BBC World Service. To this day nobody one knows what made them pass the message on, divine providence maybe? ""You are in position of our god. For your own sake, we advise that you release him. That is all. Tanna""

The response was ready within hours. Bound and bloody, Prince Philip was brought before the camera and forced to his knees. ""Filthy Tannese Kafirs!"" Screeched the executioner. ""Behold your false god! See his wounds! Look how he bleeds! The true God does not bleed! See how even HIS lowliest servant can claim the life of your pathetic man-god, and convert to the ONE!TRUE!RELGION!"" 

As the executioner spoke, Prince Philip began to glow. Faintly at first, then stronger and stronger as the axe started to fall. The blade shattered and the pieces zoomed into place, forming a spiky halo around the now nearly-blinding Duke's head. As Philip arose, his bonds evaporated and a magnificent mane of golden hair sprouted from his scalp.

The God-Duke stood, radiating golden light, and turned his piercing blue eyes on his would-be executioner. Prince Philip's halo of shards shot through the executioner's neck, severing the head more cleanly than any blade. The rest of the men opened fire. Or at least they tried to. Almost nonchalantly, Philipus raised his arm. The men's weapons were forced into the sky and rained down what looked suspiciously like pig-shaped meteors upon their wielders. Screams of pain, terror and that particular kind of disgust the devout express when faced with heresy, rent the night sky. Most of the younger recruits were crushed immediately, while more seasoned veterans perished among bacon-scented flames. 

At this point, Philipus Maximus was twenty feet tall and growing steadily. He towered over the entirety of the Islamic State, all of whom had shown up to witness the destruction of what they foolishly thought a false-god. With another swish of his arm, most burst gore. All except for those who had only just arrived from Europe and had yet to find wives. For them, Philip threw back his head and from within his mouth there came a glow, like a volcano that's about to erupt. The European converts were flung through the air into the God-Duke's gaping maw. A fitting virgin sacrifice. 

Finally satiated, Philipus shrank back down, though he still glowed with divine light.

Again, we'd use ""ye"". ""Ya"" is used when calling someone a name, eg ""YA BALDY PRICK!""

We'd use ""yer"" instead of ""yoor"". Ya is perfect (see the example above), but we don't use ""fookin"", that's more of an English thing; Fuckin is just fine (At most, we'd say ""feckin""). 
And we'd use ""wee"" instead of ""little"". So it would probably read...

Who knew Israel had such advanced genetic weapons that could target individuals based on their beliefs, geography, or genetics said President Obama before signing the appropriations bill. The Israelis were insisting on a few things in order that they might not use this weapon en masse against all of its enemies and detractors. All Palestinians would need to leave the occupied territory and relocate to a newly built settlement in Jordan. The Israelis were not totally heartless, they spent $4 Billion on the new settlement to ensure Palestinians would have a comfortable start with modern amenities. The Jordanians agreed due to the payment plans and for medical and defense technologies. Israel followed through and after a rough few months only a few hundred Palestinians remained. Israel followed through on its threat and those remaining few were quietly dead within a week. Meanwhile the Palestinians were settling into their new home nicely and even appeared to be thriving. Israel was neutralizing threats all over the world. It appears taht Jewish people invented the ultimate Eugenics technology, and although they did not behave perfectly, it was far better for the world than it could have been had this been a Islamic, Russian, Chinese, or American invention. Once again, much like in ancient times under Rome, one small nation state would exert tremendous influence around the world. Not only could the Israeli genetics program take lives, but it was estimated that its medical use would allow someone to live to be 300 years old. The world started to sing a different tune about the Israelis as the world elites poured into Israeli with untold fortunes so that they may benefit from this Israeli miracle of Science. It seemed that Israel was even willing to help former enemies and forgive so long as the future could be more peaceful. They all agreed as Israel was not looking to conquer them, but rather simply have them recognize its current borders, and cease all political, military, or other forms of harassment towards the Jewish state. They all complied unanimously. Meanwhile groups like ISIS were dying off like some lone species with an infection. The control the Israelis now had over the nano world and genetic material gave them almost God like powers. The Doctors and Scientists behind it disappeared into the shadowy world of the military industrial complex and the secrets of the new science guarded as if it was the Ark of the Covenant. It was a new world, one where Muslim influence became a zero sum game. Those on good terms with the West flourished as never before. Cancer and other diseases were cured. The Israelis just brought paradise to earth and merely asked for the occupied territories and to be accepted and forgiven by all nations in exchange for being able to visit Israel and gain treatment.

In all his forty years as a journalist, he had never seen anything this outrageous, and now it came to him only months after he finally retired. The war against the Islamic State had been raging on for nearly ten years at that point, with no signs of stopping whatsoever. The U.S., Russia, Germany, the UK, France, China, just about every nation in the world had spent hundreds of billions of dollars and millions of soldiers each trying to stop the threat looming in the Middle East, but to no avail– for every soldier killed, every town that they razed, another two would pop up, more vengeful and crazy than the one before it. John could remember reporting on one of those cases– a decently-sized town in Syria, full of hostage innocents, was bombed to smithereens by American drones. John shook his head remorsefully; he was as patriotic as anybody, but killing all of those poor civilians? And for what?
That had been three years ago, when the idea of Operation Freundschaft was only just being conceived in the mind of some UN member. John shook his head again and chuckled in spite of himself; he could just imagine government scientists from around the globe trying to figure out the logistics for that mission, because there really were none. The plan had, in all probability, been scrapped and thrown in a closet or back room to rot, until the world finally got desperate enough to use it. Heck, they'd done basically everything else; biological warfare, chemical warfare, even a minor nuclear weapon. Why not this?
John took a sip of his coffee and turned on the news, hoping, however unlikely, that something else might be broadcast. He shook his head ruefully as the flag of blue and red with a crown between them showed up in the upper left corner of the screen; he should've known better. The anchor was an old friend of his; if he remembered correctly
""... The eighty soldiers were all awarded with Liechtenstein's highest medal of honor this morning, after they arrived home safely this morning after the successful execution of Operation Freundschaft. We interview Nils Meier, one of the soldiers, yesterday in Vaduz.""
The video cut to a young blond man in military clothing. He had a bad sunburn, but was all smiles. Behind him was a bustling group of other soldiers, all smiling as well and waving at the camera.
""Um... yes,"" he said in heavily accented English. ""We did not... eh... We did not really expect it to work out.  But... um... We Liechtenstiners are very friendly, so if anyone could do it, it would be us!"" He beamed once more at the camera, which switched back to the news report.
""The governments of many nations worldwide, including France and the U.S., are currently looking into further usages of 'friend conversion warfare.' Meanwhile, the UN is still struggling to find homes for the newly befriended ISIS soldiers, many of whom were left with nearly no material possessions after they were convinced to surrender by their newfound Liechtensteinian friends. Sofia Williams, Damascus.""
John switched off the TV and went to pour himself another cup of coffee.

Vivaldi's Winter was playing in Mohammed ears, his white IPhone headphones dangling in the dry wind of the deserted and desert region. The trucks were screaming dirt, damage and cold war. 

He had arrived in winter. Obviously not here but thousands of miles away in a small Serbian town close to the European border. He remembered the biting cold, the smell of warm food faintly spreading from the inspectors hut. His stomach was empty, his leg tired and he his heart was ecstatic. He had made it. Europe. Peace. Equality. Safety. Finally happiness.

The blue flags with yellow stars flattered in the merciless winds of an undead land. ""My brothers had whiped away our culture, our chance of happiness and most importantly my entire family"" crossed Mohammed's troubled mind as the musik made him wander in the memories he associated with these lands, the memories he tries so hard to forget. 
He could still remember his sister's beautiful large brown eyes staring at him. Her dismembered head lying in the dirt while dark red blood was streaming out of the stump of a pregnant twenty year old girl. Her face showed no fear. Her eyes were as peaceful as ever. 


Mohammed wants no revenge. Mohammed wasn't here because of revenge.


Ironically the drafting began in December, too. After living one year in Germany and trying his hardest to get a grip of their uneccessarly complicated grammar(at least that's what he thought), the winds began to drastically change direction in Europe. Sadly it was a strong wing blowing hard from the wrong side of politics. The stronger the wind blew the crazier the ideas became. The people he once considered as his lifesavers as angels even, began to turn into heartless devils. After several incident involving refugees raping German women in cologne the Bundestag passed the AISEL. 

The moon did not show that night. He most likey, was too embaressed to see the tragedy that was about to unfold down on earth. War torn humans were the answer the most developed countries in the entire world came up with to defeat ISIS. They just wanted to live in peace and to start anew but they would have earn their right to do so. If the refugees wanted to be part of the superior culture, they would first have to defend the principles of the true democracies:

[WP] The Islamic State is wiped out by a totally unexpected country in a totally unexpected way.,chinli,"People use to think Bob was a traitor, but thanks to YouTube and my reporting we now know the truth. 

Bob spoke good English and other languages and had been a woodworker in Logan, Ohio for many years. The thing is, Bob isn't American, he's Estonian, so he says, but nobody knows or can prove enough about him to deport him. I met him about 10 years ago when doing a feature on his shop for the paper and we bonded over our love of NCIS the TV show. 

The thing that really struck me about Bob is that Bob doesn't exist on paper prior to 2000. Bob could have been American if not for all his half connections to terrorism, although none of it could be proven. That's what kept him from citizenship. I reported on that two. He was third cousins to some guy who did some bad thing some 4,000 miles away or his mother's step-sister's uncle was a terrorist. That sort of stuff.

Bob and I talked frequently, small town and all it's hard not to. People talk and try to be friendly in person, even if they talk about you behind your back. 

When Bob learned about Islamic State he studied them beyond what seemed normal. Bob learned their customs, their region, their values, and even their movements. People started to distance themselves from him, although his nature never changed besides the fact that he began to pray more often and he had books on guns and middle eastern history written in Arabic in his shop. 

It was widely speculated that the FBI, the CIA, NSA and who knows who else from the alphabet soup of government agencies was tracking, recording and following Bob. 

One day bob was gone. Just vanished. All his stuff, his life, wiped out as if he'd never owned that shop. Nobody knew what happened to him until it was reported on the news. Bob had ""defected"" to the Islamic state and was among their troops. The town was a whole pit of gossip and that's all anyone talked about. They talked about Bob and how he was a murderer and a traitor. The national news media picked up the story of my missing person story, twisted it, reported non-stop for weeks about this American defector who was right under everyone's nose. 

After a few months people started to and eventually forgot about Bob. I didn't. I wondered what he was up to and why he had made the change. I knew that Bob wasn't a terrorist. He was just a white guy from Estonia in his mid 60s with grey hair and a friendly smile. 

Just when everyone had forgotten about him Bob sent me a message asking me to pay him a visit in Egypt. He even flew me out. I didn't feel unsafe. Islamic state had become increasingly less active in the last few months. Bob said not to worry about the alphabet soup that would inevitably follow me. Bob said they needed to hear it all.

Bob picked me up at the airport in a car that was really expensive. I'm no car person but it had to be hundreds of thousands if not more. We talked normally, as we had before he vanished, for many years. We drove for a few hours and stopped outside this shack. It looked similar to where he'd been staying in Logan if not a little bit more run down. 

We step inside and there is one man tied to a chair. I can't see his face, there's a bag over it. Bob walks over and removes the bag. 

Bob introduces me to Abdul and informs me that Abdul is the last Islamic State member alive. Bob said Abdul was a courier and servant to the leadership and had been with the organization many years. It was through Abdul that he tracked down all the members of the organization and ""took care of the problem."" 

I was skeptical at first but I did as I was instructed. Bob asked me there for an interview and I wasn't going to pass up the opportunity. I set up my video camera and asked the questions. 

I got Abdul to say his name, where he was from and why he was here. He said he was here to die, an answer I was not expecting. Abdul told me he was there to explain and then to die.

We talked for 15 minutes about everyone who was dead. Leaders, soliders, scholars, both men and women and most of the children. Everyone who aided in violence and killing and took up arms was gone, died at their own hand,...except Abdul. He said he had to tell the truth, the whole story. The stories went on for an hour. I even had to change my battery to finish the interview. Abdul shared stories of people begging for forgiveness before taking their own lives. 

I then asked my final two questions the two I was most curious about. How did it happen and why was Abdul so sure he was about to die.

Abdul, at Bob's urging, said they felt so much remorse for all the atrocities they had done that most of them just went out in the desert and died of sadness. It was the purple dinosaur that had shown them the way with his song and they needed to repent for their sins. It was then that Abdul thanked me for my time and he put his head down and said he was ready. Bob then unshackled Abdul who walked over to the table took out a knife and stabbed himself in the heart.

After a minute, it was all over. 

I then turned my attention back to Bob and asked him...how he'd done it how were they all gone? Bob said it with a seriousness and peace I'd not heard before. 

It was Barney, Bob said. I made them watch Barney for weeks. 

Sitting there, shocked, I asked one final question. 

""So does this make Barney a terrorist?"" 

I'm still waiting on Bob's answer.",DrShadyTree

[WP] The Islamic State is wiped out by a totally unexpected country in a totally unexpected way.,chinli,"The two lead vehicles were the APCs - Russian BTR-60s. They had been instructed to not approach within sight of the checkpoint until the all-clear had been given by the forward platoon. They reached the pre-determined point and waited.

Milan sent a four-man fireteam to the first building and told them to wait for his signal to attack. While they waited, the remainder of the platoon went to take up a position on the hill over the main checkpoint and set up their AGS-30 grenade machine gun. Upon Đorđević's signal, all hell broke loose on the road below.

The first house was cleared almost entirely without a fight--the three guards, sitting around and smoking, were shot with a silenced rifle before being able to raise an alarm or bring their own weapons to bear. It was not so quiet at the main checkpoint. Branko, the AGS gunner, went first for the man by the PKM and then for the RPG carrier. Combined with rifle fire from the remainder of the platoon, the result was an absolute bloodbath. The Serbs moved into the road, clearing up any obstacles and appropriating the PKM for their own force. The call to continue had already been given to the convoy--suspicion had been raised inside the city by the destruction of their outposts.

On the ridge, the observer team didn't notice any movement of troops to the attack site. The first stir within the city was a pair of technicals setting off towards the checkpoints, but by this time the two APCs were already crossing the ridge. The first Islamic State reaction was the two technicals, which were allowed to close within 300 yards when the KPV machine guns on the APCs lit them up. There was no response other than a blaze from the engine compartment. There was to be no organized resistance until they got to the bridges over the Euphrates.",YaAmerikanets

Sternamens' shoulder. The Colonel replied with an glance and an acknowledgment-nod then continued his conversation without missing a beat. The Battle Staff room was filled with muffled conversations of various engagements across the Middle East Theater, and Airmen weren’t supposed to stick around after delivering messages, but this time he did. The Airmen thought he'd better. Col. Sternamen returned his glance to the young Airmen as if to inquire of his presence, and received a curt ""Sir.""  


 In the hall Col. Sternanmen received the half complete and confusing message:  


""Very ill....... Pyongyang........ Ev..yo.e..... Code ..ed im.......ly. "" 


""What am I supposed to do with this? Get Com."" ordered Col. Sternanmen in a peved tone.

Another young Airmen, cute in her dress blues and pinned up hair, half entered the hall from Command, and interrupted ""Col. Sir, Osan SOCOM is on the line.""  


""Hold that thought,"" and Sternamen picked up the line in haste and confusion. What was the Special Operations Command in Korea calling him for he thought?  


""Col. Sternamen."" Stated the confused Colonel. 


""Sternamen, we have a situation."" Replied a gruff old voice, yet familiar. 


""General?"" 


""There is a Koran. I'm afraid they got it to your region."" 


""I don't follow sir."" 


""A Koran. It was laced by the North Koreans as a reprisal for trying to convert their citizens in Africa, and undermine his supreme leadership. It was laced with polonium, well the letters were. In a special ink Kim Jong-Un ordered special made. A fake page was then inserted into an old Koran they acquired from the black market. It used to be a prized possession of Saddams' before he lost it all, and the Iraqis'. The North Koreans picked it up for insurance, and it paid off big."" 


""Whoa, How so General? I have a man... He called in. Kinda sounds like he may been infected."" 


""I'm sorry Colonel. We'll take some damage on this one, but I think we're looking at the end of ISIS.

""I concur. Branko, let me grab those thermals, I want to check it out myself."" The General scanned the vast expanse of Syrian desert in front of him that separated his force of six hundred Serbian mercenaries from the city of Ar-Raqqah, the Islamic State's de-facto capital. Phase Line Gamma was the ridge that separated the desert from the cultivated land on the banks of the Euphrates. After reaching that, the Serbs would have to speed into the capital over two bridges and link up in the center.

At 0300, the desert silence was shattered by the sounds of almost a hundred engines starting up. Although they had no heavy armor, they did possess several technicals and a couple of APCs bought on the local black market at great cost. They thundered down the disused desert road to the ridgeline, hoping that the reconnaissance was correct in reporting a lack of IEDs. Even so, a 20-man light platoon was hidden in the desert, ready to pounce on the makeshift Islamic State checkpoint that guarded the back road to Raqqa.

Milan Đorđević was scarcely twenty years old, too young even to remember the fighting that caused his family to flee his native Kosovo. Although he was not the most experienced, he was considered by several of his comrades to be ever-so-slightly insane, and as such was chosen to command the platoon tasked with clearing the checkpoint.

There were two parts to the checkpoint, a building to the front and a typical checkpoint 500 yards back. A cursory look with a thermal monocular showed three men in the first building, and a squad of ten to twelve in the second. All were armed, but none of them seemed to be at the ready. There was a PKM with a tripod and a single man with an RPG of some sort at the second checkpoint, but that wasn't about to be a problem for Milan and his men.",YaAmerikanets

Fortunately, nobody was killed, but Rio´s carnaval was destroyed. Brazilians demanded a strong answer from their government, but they had not fought a serious war for at least 150 years, so how to react? How to succeed where warfaring countries had failed?

Well, the answer came from the strangest of the places: Mauro Maravilha, São Paulo´s most famous carnavelesco devised a plan. Destroy Daesh without a single bullet. How? Mulatas, cerveja and, obviously, samba.

Brazilians united into one goal: to become the ultimate propaganda machine that would strike into the heart and mind of the jihadists. With catchy slogans as ""Is better a Mulata today then 70 virgins tomorrow"",  the Daesh recruitment fell to almost nothing in no time.

Then came the bombing. Weird bombs: of pictures of beautifully tanned men and women(""lay down your weapons and join the party!""it was written), chilling cold brazilian beer kegs chuted, pandeiros, cavaquinhos, speakers that would blast the best of the best brazilian music 24/7.

And finally,  the land invasion. The Samba Brigades were made of such skilled musicians, that no one, I mean, NO ONE, that heard their music could stand still. 

But not all is good news for the brazilians. Now is 2020, and Raqqa´s carnaval parade is rumoured to be even greater then Rio´s.

The two strong black men loved white women. Today however what caught their eye was not a white woman, but rather an islamic one. The strip joint had recently acquired the services of Mia Khalifa. The two black men were taken by her large breasts and beauty. Lenny then accosted Mia: ""Yo towl-hed you like da bbc?"". Taken aback by Lenny's charm and grace, Mia smiled and ran her finger down from her lips to her breasts. Lenny and James had their way with Mia. 

The next day the two black lads made their way to Syria. They had only one thing on thier minds (literally): Mid-eastern females. 

""Ooga wa wa"" said James to the nearest Syrian female. She was taken by his charm and intellect, and the two immediately made their way to a public bathroom. James and Lenny were not fond of Syria. They didn't understand what the Arabic symbols meant, this however did not prevent the two gentlemen from staying in Syria for many years: they cucked many a Syrian male, and fucked many a Syrian female. 

Nine months later, and 86% of all newborns in Syria were black/arabic mixes. The Syrian men had taken a liking to having their women being stolen by blacks and had as a result opened the borders to black Ugandan men. 
With the borders open, Syria and the mid-east in general degraded to nothing more and nothing less than deepest Africa. 

The people of Syria were happy. They had found peace and love and unity. There was no anger and thus no militant religious groups took power. ISIS crumbled. 

James and Lenny held hands. They sipped on thier wisky and did up their dress shirts. ""Wot wez gona do tonite boi"" said Lenny to James. James chuckled to his long time friend, and showed him two plane tickets to Sweden. The pair smiled, Syria was only the beginning.

The TV blared as the family watched in awe.  This was the first time in history anything had ever happened like this.  Today was momentous indeed.

Little Corbin had a drum beating in his heart, he never felt more excited.  A line had been drawn in the sand for ISIS.  Corbin wanted nothing more than to lead a charge like that.

""Many congratulations and thank yous belong to our boys, you did Uncle Sam proud.""

Corbin's father had a vision of safety for his children for the first time in a long while.  The threat of WWII loomed for so long like a gigantic toxic mushroom shadowing the entirety of the United States.  He breathed a sigh of relief at this recent, crushing blow to ISIS.

""But the real consideration goes to our neighbors to the north.  They were not known for their prowess in battle but after May 23's major attack on several of its biggest hockey stadiums; they joined the fight.  

""I want to thank Canada's troop for a swift victory against ISIS on their own sandy soil.  We could not have done it without you.  We also want to thank the Canadian special ops mounties that infiltrated high priority targets and effectively cut the head off of this snake!  We are finally free to live again.""

Corbin's mother watched as the president started to hand out awards.  She glanced at her husband just to sum him up, she looked back to the tv.  The president slid the first medal over the lead mounty on stage.  The mounty had to help the president get the medal down onto his hyper muscular neck.  

Why couldn't her husband have a neck like that, so strong, so thick, so hockey player like.  She dreamed of the great white north and a great athletic man to live in the mountains with. 

The sheep the man was riding on stage had a neck of the same size.  It was muscular and well groomed, the way any Canadian mounty sheep should be.  It's curly wool was so white it looked like it was shining.

The president struggled to put a medal around the sheep's neck as well.

""We also want to thank the mounty's sheep, without their dedicated and loyal service we would not have this victory.""

The president pet the sheep's head and the sheep closed its eyes as if in admiration.

""Thank you Mutton for your service.""  The president looked at the camera.  He had a tear in his eye

""Daddy! the president is crying!""  Little Corbin said.

His father had a tear in his eye as well  ""I know son, I know.""

The president repeated the medal process for all five members of 'Buddy team Charlie' 

At the end the president addressed the crowd once more. 

""These brave souls and their sheep stood up to the world's greatest threat and stand victorious.  We lost many and even more were injured.""  He gestured to Trudy, the mangled lamb with a purple heart stuck to her chest.  ""But together we triumphed.  All I want to say is, today the US and Canada are not only neighbors by border, but brothers by blood!""

Corbin cried, he would go on to move to Canada and do great things on the newly formed mounty military.  He named his sheep Charlie.",tycllns

-	I’ll take it here. Come in and bring Dr. Shengen.

General Raid turns and waves. Next moment, the phone rings as Dr. Shengen and General enter the room and close the door behind them. Obama, eyes focused on some imaginary distant planet speaks:

-	Foster, they are on their way, I’m guessing?

Foster’s voice comes through:

-	Yes, Sir. They are on their way. Expected to land before dawn. Five minutes to go.

-	Did we mark the locations?

-	Yes, Sir. We got confirmation from them. Our satellites will navigate once they come to 20,000 feet. We have 120 landing locations. 

-	Good. Our guys in place.

-	Yes, Sir. All systems a go. We wait for your call. Do we have authorization to proceed as planned, Sir?

-	Authorized as planned. Thank you.

Obama looks to General Reid and hands over the phone:

-	Foster?

-	Yes, Sir.

-	General Reid here.

-	Yes, Sir.

-	Reminding you, exit strategy will be launched 24 hours from landing. All 120 locations.

-	Yes, Sir. They’ve been informed and will comply. Self-destruct protocol in place.

-	We cannot allow any leak. 

-	Yes, Sir. Video feed is ready and we’ll broadcast to Oval Office as soon as they land.

-	If I see any of this on Reddit, it will be your ass, Foster. Or, LiveLeak.

-	Yes, Sir. YouTube?

-	That’s funny, Foster. Over and out.

-	Thank you, Sir.

General looks to Obama who nods. Phone is hanged up and all they can do is wait. Obama gives a  probing look at Dr. Shengen and before he can ask  a question, Dr. Shengen begins:


-	Mr. President, we tried very hard to negotiate on how they will go about this but they wouldn’t do it if they cannot do what they are naturally programmed to do. Yes, it will be a carnage of gigantic proportions. Yes, the  blood will flow on the sand. Their culture is deeply rooted in hunting and killing. They practically invented a kill as a trophy. From our recent communications with them, their internal war was about keeping their traditions and the side that wanted their tradition to stay as we know it, that side won and to ask them for any change would be almost disrespectful. It was a bad timing, maybe in few years they’d soften a bit but we couldn’t wait any longer, Mr. President. They like the challenge and they like things done their barbaric way. And these days, as you know very well Mr. President, ISIS is the most barbaric and by far the biggest challenge on Earth so who better to take them on. Also, these guys, it’s not like they didn’t shed blood in the Middle East throughout history. In my professional opinion they are the ones for the job. United States and allies have spent last 50 years in humanizing the warfare and we, frankly speaking, lost the edge. We don’t fight like they do. These guys, they didn’t change since the beginning. My team and I are confident that this will be resolved within 24 hours and ISIS will be no more. As per our briefing a month ago, Mr. President, they are really good at cleaning their own tracks so only people who will know about them – aside, of course, from us - will be dead. Our plan is bulletproof and they promised to keep it that way. They don’t like publicity either. On top of that, while we had some difficulties in our relationship, historically speaking, this is not the first time an empire asked them for a favor like this. I think, and this is purely a speculative, that they themselves would like to improve our relationship and this definitely goes a long way to show that superpower like Unites States is open for a mutually beneficial relationship. I would also …


Dr. Shengen stops mid-sentence as suddenly a giant screen on the other wall comes alive. All three turn their heads and watch intently. It begins. Screen is split in nine sections, each showing one of the 120 landing locations Foster mentioned. One in the upper left corner labeled “Rutba, Iraq” starts shaking and slowly waves of sand start circling. Faster they circle more violently the screen shakes. As the dust starts to mesh with smoke, a huge shapely vehicle enters the screen. Obama and General Reid approach the screen for closer viewing. Dr. Shengen is unmoved. The other eight screens start shaking and filling with dust. Their attention is still on the upper left corner. What looks like a space ship comes to a stop and dust starts to settle. Wide vertical door opens up like an elevator door and laser-like light bursts out. Camera seems to be blinded by all the light coming at it. All we see is light filling up the screen as the brightest Sun. Very next moment, a large seven foot presence comes at the door frame, familiar dreadlocks and weapons clearly identifiable. The Predator is back on Earth.

A high shot shows dust and sand flying as a large land force approachs a city. The camera zooms in to show a massive force of kangaroos closing in fast. A few dozen military officers riding emus are not to far behind them. 

Another abrupt cut shows the kangaroos attacking the Islamic State forces in close combat as blackness begins to flow from their pouches. Spiders and scorpions run out onto the battlefield and begin attacking their targets. 

More creatures begin to come out of the roos pouches. Snakes of varying size and color, a couple of dingos, and a few crocodiles. 

The man turns off the television and smiles knowing that his nation was the turning factor in the fight against the Islamic State. He chuckles to himself and says quietly, ""Well, at least we were kind enough not to send in the dropbears. Them little fucker are savage"". ",PokemonTrainerJib

[WP] The Islamic State is wiped out by a totally unexpected country in a totally unexpected way.,chinli,"July 1st, 2017. The world will never forget July the 1st, 2017. ISIS had recovered from the initial shock of the sudden resistance after the Paris attacks of 2015, and were doing better than ever. Iraq, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and now even Iran was falling apart beneath the crushing tide of ISIS. 

Iran seemed to be at war with itself, having radicalized the population against the western world already themselves the government didn't see that they had set themselves up for an IS takeover as the country tried to become more rational in order to regain trade relations with the rest of the world. The people of Iran quickly saw their government as puppets, and many joined under the banner of the Islamic State.

Israel was on the edge of collapse, now entirely surrounded by the Islamic State, the people were fighting amongst themselves even more than usual as they argued about the course of action. Many wanted to take the nuclear route, but others were more hesitant to take so much human life. Others wanted to simply leave, a mass evacuation. Still, the whole world sat and watched as it seemed inevitable that this war was going to escalate into a nuclear massacre. 

It seemed, as the days went on, more and more people were glued to the news to get any bit of information. There was almost always a live stream of drone footage in the regions of high conflict now. Every day the footage was the same, it seemed like an eternal state of dead lock military conflict. It was on July the 1st 2017, however, that the footage on the live stream was different. As millions of viewers watched and listened, they began to hear a faint song. A chant. The words were impossible to make out over the gun shots and explosions at first. But then suddenly, just barely on screen, a massive cloud of dust formed. Slowly it marched across the screen. The closer it got, the more clear the chant became. The sounds of guns were replaced with what sounded like a stampede. Suddenly it stopped.

From the new found silence the chant became clear. ""O Canada"" the voices chanted as the dust settled ""The True North strong and free!"". From the settling dust, the unmistakable silhouettes of Moose formed. On their backs rode tens of thousands of Mounties in their ceremonial red uniforms. Forward they marched again, slower at first. ""From far and wide"" the hockey stick armed soldiers continued ""O Canada, we stand on guard for thee"". The mass marched forward, consuming the enemy forces one by one. Screams were barely heard over the chant and the march of the Moose. ""God keep our land glorious and free!"" onward they marched, into the valley of death. The feeds cut and a voice took over. ""Eh, this is Canada. We went ahead for ya buds and dealt with that ISIS thing. You know us northerners eh, we just wanted to get it done quick."" The voice was unmistakably Canadian. ""Sorry Eh"" the voice was gone.",FIleCorrupted

[WP] The Islamic State is wiped out by a totally unexpected country in a totally unexpected way.,chinli,"Joe sat and waited for sunrise. Rifle in his lap but no bullets. That black flag staring at him. 

So much life lost because of it but it was almost over now. 

There was one final message before the web ceased to exist. The web begun around the turn of the millennium, not long before the Jihad began. Still quite a while before the Mehdi. Centuries of knowledge gone in the blink of eye. Amazing when you think about it - almost everything stored in nothing. The message was nothing profound, not befitting the end of the world. It simply said “The last ship has left. May God be with you if you stay”. Still clinging on to God at a time like this. Joe hadn’t made it to the beach in time. 

Rebels had blocked the road to stop the vast armed convoy reaching the fleet. What they lacked in firepower they replaced in numbers and sacrifice. This really was a last stand. They swarmed like locusts towards them. Packs broke away towards the front vehicles absorbing bullets until the odd hit on a suicide vest would scatter body parts in the smoke. Then they hit the convoy and explosions cascaded down the line. Complete devastation of both sides in minutes.
  
Joe watched in awe as they headed towards him at the rear of the detonating line of tanks, trucks and jeeps. This was all they had left, dedicated and insane. He knew they were giving up their lives in the pursuit of a crazy belief and there was nothing to change that. Those Savages. He threw himself out of the door, emptied his rifle into the crowd of bodies, ran, reloaded and fired. Crawled. Got away. Ran. Fell. 

Lifting himself out of the mud and blood soaked earth he saw a child before him. Gun in hand. Fear in his eyes. Sadness. Desperation. His finger twitched.
Joe fired. A single burst. The child still dropped. Joe was still alive. 
Joe had killed a lot of people before and he knew he had killed women and children. He just didn’t think about it. But he had never had to look into their eyes. Into the eyes of a child. Maybe it was just the magnitude of what was going to happen but something changed.
 
He started running for the beach. He didn’t really know why, there was no point. He just wanted to see how many ships had made it. The way they had sacrificed themselves so that the others could escape. Even that child. He couldn’t figure out why it was bothering him so much. He was supposed to stop them.

They had already won. The Islamic State had raised its flags around the World. They had torn down the monuments of civilisation, destroyed the false idols and the technology that had given the west dominance for so long. It had taken hundreds of years. Countless lives. Finally all that had remained of the west were rebels, insurgents and terrorists. They have collapsed and fled. Now it was time for the end.  

Joe sat and watched and cried. The child’s face tearing his mind apart, his soul screaming inside him. He wondered for the first time in his life if this really was all part of a masterful divine plan.

Joe couldn’t appreciate the sheer irony as civilisation’s last fleet disappeared over the horizon towards the dark nation. Once equally feared and ridiculed, they were cut off from the rest of the world. And while the rest descended towards the apocalypse they prepared. This wasn’t going to save them though. It would become nothing more than a monument, a final graveyard. They probably wouldn’t last long. Probably. 

As the sun began to rise Joe spotted the rockets in the distance. These relics of fear that one side thinks will save them, while on the other hand Joe's prophecy is fulfilled. First just a few. Then hundreds. Then thousands. It would be over soon. ‘This is what we wanted?’ He wondered. He smiled.

ISIS had toppled local governments and taken them over. Claiming most of the Middle East. Many countries themselves had made agreements with ISIS in order to try to secure themselves so that they would not be toppled as well.

America was the last to stay in the fight, but American government had finally decided on a full retreat. The retreat would happen the next day, and Platoon 608 was the last ditch effort. This was an assassination attempt on the ISIS leaders. 

Platoon 608  stood on top of a building in the new ISIS capital, where nearby a speech was being given.  They were lined up to be a firing squad, it was a suicide mission.

As the Platoon sat there, hoping that they could maybe make it out of this alive. They heard a clapping. They figured the speech must have been over. But an hour later there was still clapping, and it has immensely grown in volume. 

The major ordered them to stay where they were with their scopes in place, they were not to move. Eventually one of them gave in to the curiosity, and looked towards the direction of the clapping. 

What he saw left him frozen in shock. There were atleast 100,000 men on horses, and they wore the maple leaf and guns. The clapping had been the horses drawing near. They all wore the insignia of the Maple Leaf.

The Canadian Calvary had arrived.

Syed hurried back to his room. ""I think i'm done with this; i'm going back to my home and becoming a farmer.""

 Farook couldn't figure out where the fighting spirit in his buddy had gone. It had  waned completely overnight. At least he would receive his reward in heaving from fighting. The sweet, sweet, heavenly reward, something he could not wait for, and would not hesitate to die for. 

As Farook was walking towards the armory, and small black tablet with a parachute attached to it sat in the sand about a few hundred meters away. 
*That looks like Syed's,* Farook thought. 

Farook cautiously approached the tablet when he noticed a note written in Arabic was attached to it. ""Heaven is on earth"", it read.

Farook picked up the tablet. He heard of devices like these. *Computers.* It was strange to be holding such technology, having never owned a television set or radio in his 18 years of life. 

The curiosity was too much, Farook had to activate the device and see what the letter meant. 

He pushed on the power button, to see an imagine of a naked blonde woman, busty and beautiful. The video then started to play.

Farook was completely enticed by what he was seeing that he did not realize how much time had went by. He felt the urge to release. 

""Hey Farook!"" his team leader called. "" What the fuck are you doing? We're moving out in 5.""

""Uh, I think i'm gonna sit this one out, sir. I don't need payment. And I just don't feel good."" Farook said nervously. ""In fact, I think i'm just gonna go home and become a farmer.""

Cities bursted in gasoline, propane and fertilizer. How could it work? It was *not* supposed to work. Fertilizer bombs are not guaranteed to work, being unstable and untreatable like they are, and those are usually made using ammonium, not phosphate... used by terrorists themselves.

The long-time foe of the American citizen, ISIS, was finally dead, but many are disappointed that they never got the chance to witness the US do it first.

We were on the brink of nuclear war. They even bothered to dust off the Clock from the basement of the Pentagon, setting it immediately to 11:59. One minute from nuclear annihilation. ISIS had managed to wrestle control of nuclear silos from what used to be Israel - renamed to Levantine just days ago. We were sent in to control the evacuation of high-profile targets and civilians, then exfil and wait for orders.

The orders we were all waiting for never came, but rather a surprising headline blaring over the television in the barracks from our Saudi-American base in Haql.

""In a surprising turn of events, Madagascar has declared war on the newly-established Levantine, and threatens to completely devastate their infrastructure through classified means,"" the newscaster announced, clad in IIIA body armor, just outside of the Madagascan US embassy, ""We'll update as more information is available.""

I doubt the ensuing chaos started even a second after that broadcast - the skies behind the reporter blackened, almost as if with ash or soot, as a massive wave of airplanes filled the skies behind them. From my count, it had appeared as if it were a joint strike between every civilized country and Madagascar, but it was only them.

Just hours later, our entire platoon found ourselves outside, staring up as the planes flew within 100 miles of us, as black as any stormfront we've ever seen - it even appeared as if they were raining.

It wasn't until another few hours after that we had realized what that ""rain"" was. Several tons of chicken feathers per plane, doused in slow-burning oil, were ignited and dumped on the capitols and military bases of Levantine. The sight was spectacular, the base closest to my camp had been erased from the map under the feathers, the ash columns miles high.

Me? I was just glad it was over - afterwards, the surviving members of ISIS publicly disbanded and renounced their ways, fearing further retaliation from the oddball approach to war the Madagascan military resorted to.

Sweat was leaking from Mohammad's brow, collecting in his large handlebar mustache, the beard of which had been lost in a freak Suicide Bombing accident. 

The lid of the box lifted, sending up a swirl of packing peanuts, revealing within a single K-Cup of ""White Chocolate Mecca.""

""Muhammad,"" Mohammad said, in awe of the holy K-Cup, ""Please tell me you have the Qu'rig in your pack?""

""Right here,"" Muhammad said as he handed Mohammad a large Keurig Brewing System with a sizable LED display. Mohammad quickly pulled the K-Cup from the crate and planted it in the Qu'rig, navigating the menu to get the drink brewing. He placed his special ""To-Blow Mug"" in the tray and waited anxiously as the machine played popular ISIS tunes while it preheated. 

As they waited, an eagle soared overhead, crying a frantic, staccato, torn, high-pitched scream. It distracted both Muhammad and Mohammad, taking their eyes to the sky. From the wings of the bird, a fine white powder sprinkled onto their noses. 

Muhammad sniffed twice, then said in shock, ""It is cocai--""

Suddenly the Qu'rig blurted out, ""PERU SENDS IT REGARDS!""

It's said that Muhammad's delicate feather was the last to burn on that fateful day.

""Mr. President, Peru has annihilated Asia,"" Ashton Carter said. 

Barack Obama looked over his shoulder, away from the basketball game where the Chicago Bulls were already down 24 civilians by halftime. ""Uhh, Peru?"" 

""Yes sir,"" Carter said, ""They developed a K-Bomb.""

""Uhhhhhhh,"" mumbled the President, ""Well, let's uh, get them uh, on the phone, I guess.""

""Yes sir,"" Carter said, tripping on his own shoes as he left the stadium. ",myjeren

Supreme Leader Trump slump back onto his throne in disbelief. His secretary brought him a glass of Trump Ice to calm him down before continuing with the report  
""Supreme Leader, it is true. Our satellite surveillance has shown that the Islamic State has been destroyed, their infrastructure shattered, their chain of command broken, their supply line cut off and members executed to a man""  
""But how is this possible? We have tried everything, we even built a wall around them but still we could not destroy them. The combined might of America and Russia could not stamp them out, what nation could possibly muster the manpower to achieve such feat?""  
""It-It's tunnels, sir""  
""WHAT?""  
""They dug tunnels under the wall, infiltrating deep inside the Islamic States territory and destroyed them from the inside""  
Supreme Leader Trump began to sweat, this is all sounding too familiar  
""But how, wouldn't they have been caught without much effort?""  
""That's what we thought, Supreme Leader. But newest intelligence shown that they had a way around it. Quite genius, if I might say. Motorbikes""  
""Motorbikes?""  
""They used motorbikes on track to navigate the extensive system of tunnels, staying one step ahead of whatever defense ISIS could muster up""  
Supreme Leader Trump sink back into his chair, breathing heavily. His worst fear has come true  
""Supreme Leader, this has just came in""  
His assistant said as he press a button on a remote, turning the gigantic flat screen display on. A video, released on Twitter, of a short Mexican man standing next to a hooded and kneeling figure  
""Oh no...""  
Supreme Leader Trump whimper  
The Mexican pull the hood off the figure. It was the head of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.  
""Is that-""  
""Yes.""  
With a thundering gunshot, Baghdadi slump to the ground, his head blown clean off  
""El Chapo...""  
The small, terrified whisper silenced the room, save the sound on the display. El Chapo turn and looks straight at the camera, his smoking gun raised  
""Donald Trump, you're next""

[WP] The Islamic State is wiped out by a totally unexpected country in a totally unexpected way.,chinli,"Bright Red trucks rolled over the dunes with military precision. They slid to a stop in the sand, uniform about a mile out from the ISIS encampment.  There they stopped. Waiting.

They'd been found. The fundamentalist terrorists grabbed their weapons, screamed a mix of prayer and threat and readied themselves into a moderately assembled line. Their fear and hate pulsed through them as they readied themselves for the end they had been seeking for so long, in glorious battle, against the hated forces of the Devil West.

They stared down their iron sights, not sure what horrible weapon of death had been sent to eradicate them, but sure their faith and their god would protect them.

Which is why it was rather surprising when a young woman wearing flannel walked out of the lead Truck and began speaking into a megaphone. She was be translated on a loud speaker on one of the trucks behind her. 

""Hello ISIS fighters! I'm Amanda and I'm from Canada. We understand there's been a whole lot of fighting and bloodshed out here, and we think it's aboot time it was settled properly, eh? So what we'd like all of you to do, is put down your weapons, come on over here....and we're going to have a pancake breakfast!""

The ISIS troops hesitated. They look imploring at one another for guidance. One man suggests that there might be bacon, which would be pretty insulting. The men leap on that idea. Screaming death at the obvious insult, they raise their weapons and prepare to fire.

Amanda and her troops have begun laying out pancakes, waffles, with real Canadian syrup. The ISIS fighters hesitate one moment more when the delicious aroma wafts across the desert. 

One fighter, one of the youngest recruits in ISIS who was raised in the West, yells ""We'll never eat your bacon you Ameri- er...Canadian whore!""

Amanda just smiles, warm and bright. ""Oh sorry! Did we not mention?"" She holds up a platter. ""Turkey Bacon!""

============================================

The ISIS fighters were rather perplexed at the scene in front of them. Right there on the Dunes, table after table filled with Canadian and ISIS soliders, most men on both sides we bilingual or trilingual and communicating freely. Some of the younger ones were laugh, some of the older ones kept glancing sideways expecting a trick. Most others were cramming their mouths full of pancake. 

""... God wants us to do it."" One soldier was sheepishly explaining to Amanda. She smiled around a fork full of syrup-covered waffle. 

""Who told you that? I mean, sorry, not to be flippant but when my God tells me stuff, I usually wait for him to come down and say it personally, eh? Guys can get all sorts of confused otherwise.""

""Well, everybody I guess?"" 

""And if everybody jumped off a beaver dam, would you do it?""

""A what?""

""Beaver dam.  A dam made by a beaver. You know, furry things, big teeth, knock down trees?""

""No I know what what a beaver is, I just...is that an expression?""

===================================================
(3 months later)

""SHAME! Shame on all of you, you pathetic cowards! Again and again you have opportunities to kill the demons and whores of the west and again and again you have instead sat down and eaten their treacherous pancakes. I should behead every single one of you, right now!"" 

""We're sorry, Caliph, but if we could explain...""

""Explain yourself to God, and his greatness and his wrath you fools I...what is that smell...oh no. No...don't you dare.""

""They gave us some bottles of syrup for the road and-""

""Sinner! Blasphemer. Wicked, devil and...oh wow, that smells good.""

================================================

ISIS today released a new video denouncing the actions of Canada who have unilaterally declared that no more pure maple syrup would be shipped to the Middle East until, quote, ""Our ISIS buddies calm down and stop with the rowdy stuff"".  Turkish efforts to maintain the period of calm the region had been experiencing with shipments of Hungry Jack were enraging to local ISIS contingents who described them as ""Corn Syrup abominations unto God"".

As tensions mount, the President, along with out key officials are planning on travelling to Canada to see if they can be convinced to continue shipping their delicious elixir of peace to the destabilized region.

===================================================

ISIS disbanded today along with several other radical Muslim factions who had been vying for the establishment of a global Muslim theocracy. Instead, those parties have agreed to disarmament in exchange for terms. The most prevalent of which is the re institution of  ""Canadian Syrup Relief Efforts"". ",Englishgrinn

""We always have a situation, Mr.Miller. If it is nothing that requires the changing of our alert state, please wait until tomorrow to tell me."" the President of the United States of America replied in a voice betraying his weariness. It has been a long day, and it was just the first of what promised to become a long week. He just wished to get back to his wife, his children and maybe a tumbler of good Bourbon.

However, the messenger in front of him did not seem to back off and let small things fester. ""I'm afraid I must insist, Mr. President. The CIA has just received a message."" The young man with the strict cut blonde hair stopped, his eyes locking onto the note in his hands.

""I'm in no mood to play twenty questions. Spill it!""

""Its just,"" he started and with one hand loosened the collar around his neck. ""Its a message from Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State. Unconditional surrender. Nobody in the Pentagon knows what to do, but the first fighters already laid down weapons and more do as we speak. Here, read for yourself.""

The President took the crumpled note, a printed short mail with the necessary check on authencity, IP's and whatnot underneath. He knew that this must be genuine, or else the CIA would not even bother to let him know. The text on it was written in short sentences conveing what must be the most obscure surrender in history.

*""To the leaders of the west...""* it read.

*""We of the Islamic State, true believers and warriors of Allah, surrender to your cruelty. We will lay down our weapons before your feet and in return, we ask to only be kept in prisons far away from our wifes. We pray that Allah guides you to this mercy, for we are truly defeated.*

*Allahu Akbar!""*

""I hope there is a story there, else I might see myself questioning the sanity of our secret service."" the President growled out as he smashed the note down onto the desk.

""The CIA has one lead. There has been a huge movement of female recruits from middle europe in the last months. Intelligence said they were all married to ISIS warriors. Since their arrival, the fights had declined to the point of battlegrounds staying silent for days.""

""Middle Europe, you say?""

""Austria to be exact.""

The President moved back into his seat, trying to order his thoughts. The messenger in front of him just shrugged and shook his head. In the spur of the moment, he decided to pick up the phone. ""Get me the austrian chancellor.""

The secretary however, quickly informed him that the austrian chancellors was currently asleep.

""I am the President of the United States. I do not care if the chancellor of a nation that is smaller than New York City is asleep. Do it!""

The next fifteen minutes went by like hours and the President spent it by glaring at the note on his desk, the messenger that brought it and the stack of folders on this whole crisis that seemed to be over, just like that. Even worse was that the only lead he and his agencies had cam from a nation whos chancellor he loathed. The ever grinning chancellor of Austria had grated on his nerves the last time he met him, and all this irritation came back with a vengeance when the nasal voice came from the telephones speaker.

""Mr. President, it iz zruly a pleazure zo hear of you. How may I help you at zis early hour?""

""I got a letter here from ISIS, proclaiming their unconditional surrender as long as we keep them away from their wifes. Including the hundred that cam from your country in the last months. Care to explain?""

The president closed his eyes and forced himself to remain silent at the 'Ha-Hah' of the insufferable Austrian.

""We had great problem with ze refugees in ze last months, you zee?""

""Yes, I know. Go on.""

""Well, your strategies in Syria were obviouzly not working, zo we decided to take matters in our own hands.""

The Chancellor waited for the President to give that some kind of acknowledgement. Something he, the leader of the US of freakin A would not give the man. After a few seconds of silence, he continued.

""We have used one strategy zat has proven successfull throughout the history of zis great nation.""

""Get to the point, chancellor.""

""It iz easy, Mr. President. [Bella gerant alii, tu felix Austria nube. Tu felix... Austria... nube](http://www.habsburger.net/en/stories/tu-felix-austria-nube).""

Worst of all the bloody man seemed to be making it all work. He had a terribly irritating habit of being right all the time. 

Almost reluctantly the prime ministers gaze wandered from his desk, across the raggedy man he'd begun to think of as ""pain in the arse"" or ""the chief"" depending and down the chiefs arm to his hand and onto the shoulder it was holding.

The shoulder was attached to a person who would have been recognizable to any watcher of the bbc except for the snark of hate had been replaced by a look of utter confusion known only to those who have had the world pulled out from under them*.

The prime minister felt his mouth move of its own volition.

""you arrested him?"" he said hopefully.

""well, inna manner of speaking your lordship"" replied the chief shifting slightly.

Hope faded ""by which you mean you haven't arrested him yet?""

""no sir, more arrested all of them, sir""

Hope died, messily, in a back alley. ""them?""

""yessir, Isis sir.""

Despair walked out of the alleyway, whistling ""you... Aressted ISIS?""

A thousand questions came and went In a series of flashes. A thousand complaints began and died at birth. One questions elbowed its way to the front.

""how?"" the prime minister asked plaintively.

""put a page in their books?""

""do you mean took a page out of-""

""nossir, added a vial of that page stuff to their quarans, and prayer mats and their gun oil. Used some on most of the shpments we intercepted.""

""page? The time delayed contact poison? The one that knocks people out for 24 hours? The one made of apples?""

""mostly apples, yes sir""

Despair added ""chemical warfare"" to the list of problems on the prim ministers plate. Another question shouted its way to the front of the crowd"" 

""good god man, why?""

""murder, arson, consipracy to commitmmurder, rape, disturbing the queens peace and jaywalking sir""

""jaywalking""

""you told me to crack down on it last week. There was rampant jaywalking,sir, possibly due to lack of local law enforcement.""

He and, it had been an attempt to keep the chief out of sight without being forced to make the political blunder of firing the UKs most famous and,out successful police officer."" that's.... That's not a bit out of your jurisdiction chief?""

""no sir, was in hot pursuit sir, jurisdiction doesnt apply to hot pursuit sir.""

""you were in hot pursuit for well over a thousand miles commander?""

""nossir, flew to our embassy in the area on holidays with some of the force sir. Was only in hot pursuit for a few minutes chasing one of the blighters who stole my cigar case before the local authorities asked for aid.""

The prime minister gave the chief a look that said *there we no local authorities, and 90 % is not ""some of the force""*

The chief returned with a look that said *there are now, and they'll say they asked* and *it wasn't all of them.*

The prime minister flinched first, cleared his throat and said 

""very well chief, don't let me detain you any further. I'm sure you have many trial to arrange. Possibly your next focus could be a little more at home?""

Despair fled shrieking and fear took over as the prime minister was the light in the eyes of the chief and heard the words he'd just said come out of his mouth. At that moment he suspected his face was a mirror of jihadi James'.

Thought about this, with a different progression tho.

In my version, 

Kim Jong Un wants to show the world how powerful North Korea is, he decided to send nukes to Syria where the USA, Russia and some other country have stationed their troops and start world war 3.

Little did Un knows, Russia, the USA and the other country just pulled their troops to try other strategies fighting daesh, but when the nuke drops, killing daesh and unexpectedly their top leaders.

The USA are shocked and stunned on what just happened, except prolonging the fight with NK, USA decides to make a propaganda out of it to lure the hermit kingdom out of their seclusion and ~~overtake them economicaly~~ become USA economic puppet state.

Edit: I don't mean the USA overtake them in terms of the economy, I mean that the USA would beat North Korea by investing and turning them to be USA economy tool. How do I phrase this?

In the main base complex, a select group of journalists were already inside the press hall, nervously sipping coffee and checking their watches. A group of sound engineers were adding to the already colossal bouquet of microphones that adorned the podium. A man with an impressive moustache sat off to the side, headphones on, checking each mic for clarity and feedback.  He gave a knowing nod to the engineers who had finished adding Sky News to the pile before retreating to the fire exit they had propped open and began smoking their 11th cigarette of the morning. They had spent a frantic forty minutes ensuring the link-up with Holyrood was solid after it had dropped mid-way through a speech by the First Minister. They couldn't afford to lose it again, not unless they wanted this to become another referendum issue.

The inside of the huge plane smelled of oil and smoke. The former was a combination of the rather battered looking Jackal LRV and Davey who been guttering around inside the bonnet until the lieutenant had very politely but firmly asked him to strap in for the landing. Sharp eyes gleamed in the mask of oil and grime that constantly coated his face. Boaby tapped him on the shoulder and offered the bottle. Davey took it and noisily glugged from it. He shifted in his webbing to face the man sitting next to him and waved it front of him.

""Skoosh?"" he inquired. The man flinched at being directly addressed and turned his least swollen eye to look at the mechanic. No part of his face was undamaged, though none of it was permanent. It would mostly heal. The man stared blearily at him and muttered something in Arabic.

""Hey man, Shug, whasshe say man?"" Davey yelled across to the other side of the plane.

""Fuck off man, ah'm dyin'."" Shug moaned. He was curled into a ball clutching his stomach. The combined hangover and air travel was proving too much for him. If he could have undone the catch on his side-arm holster, he'd have shot himself there and then.

""Sto' bein' a faggot man and telt me what the wee malky fuck say to me!""

""He said ""Why not?"". Now shut the fuck up ya wee-!"" The last word was lost in a dry heave.

""Hah man, quality. Drink up then!"" He pressed the bottle to Baghdadi's lips and let a slug of the thick syrupy wine into his mouth. As soon as he swallowed, he began hacking and coughing, his eyes wide and bulging.

""Hah big fuckin' terrorist prick, cannae take his Bucky!"" Davey grinned round at the rest of the ""squad"". 

""Davey, calm yer fuckin' tits."" Big Jock growled from the corner. He was smoking a cigar with one hand and had a hand-rolled dogend in the other. The cigar until recently had been owned by their prisoner.

""Just sayin' he's a walloper who cannae handle his drink!"" Davey slugged the rest of the bottle and sat back with a contented sigh.

""Just keep yer traps shut while we talk to the journos then we can get aff down the pub."" Danny yelled over the brewing fight. 

""Maybe Davey'll get his hole an' all! Place'll be hoachin' wi fanny. "" Jock blew a long stream and punctuated it with a ring of smoke.

Seventy years before it was revealed how mysteriously when a crucial engine part in their LRV had failed, a crate had been air-dropped within half a mile of their position within the hour, by a plane that bore a Scottish regiment insignia and was supposed to be in a hangar in Lossiemouth. Seventy years before it would be revealed a US Airforce AC-130 had been flying reconnaissance above a suspected ISIS stronghold that was levelled by a stolen artillery platform. Or that a senior lieutenant of ISIS with a predilection for young girls was found with a broken Buckfast bottle embedded in his eye socket and a grin that went from ear to ear. The men were tried and found guilty of several war-crimes by secret tribunal. The maximum security facility they were sent to held them for all of two weeks.

""What? Here? By who? Why am I just finding out about this!""

""Calm down, sir, i'll explain everything in the Situation Room,"" the Secretary of State said, motioning towards the door.

Trump got up from behind his desk and hurried down the hallway. ""Is my life in danger? I always knew those Latinos would get their revenge. How much time do we have to get to the bunker?""

""It's... actually quite the opposite, sir,"" the Secretary explained. ""Please, come inside. The Secretary of Defense is waiting for you to give his statement.""

Trump mumbled a few things under his breath as he took his seat beside the Vice President. Papers were shuffled around and whispered conversations came to an end. The President looked visibly uncomfortable, his impatience clearly evident in the color of his face, now a bright purple.

""Please, if you'll direct your attention to the monitor..."" the Secretary of Defense began. He shifted in his chair nervously as the screen came to life. On it was a known ISIS stronghold, viewed from the air by what appeared to be a UAV. ""It was always known to the US Government that this location was one of great importance, however, we wouldn't know exactly *how* important it was until about an hour ago,"" began the Secretary. ""We knew, through our intelligence agencies, that this location would host a rather large ISIS convention. That many leaders would be here. We just didn't know when, exactly.""

""Yeah, get on with it,"" Trump said, tapping his foot on the ground. 

A few moments later, there was a soundless explosion on the screen. A mushroom cloud of epic proportions billowed out from the ground. Moments later, the video cut out.

""What the hell was that?!"" Trump exclaimed, leaning forward in his seat.

""An explosion, sir,"" the Vice President droned. 

""Don't you think I know that?"" Trump snapped back. He turned in his chair to face the Secretary of Defense. ""Who did this? What does this mean?""

The secretary began rewinding the video. The mushroom could evaporated back into the ground and all was well as far as the video feed was concerned. 

""Look closely,"" the Secretary said, pointing to the screen. ""Watch those spots there. Do you see anything moving?""

Just then, clear as day, small figures began moving away from the building. There were about 20 to 30 units, each one moving at a speed far greater than that of mere walking.

""What is it?"" Trump asked, cocking his head to the side.

""Canadians... riding moose,"" The Secretary of State declared, clearly upset.

""*Canadians?* Why? How the hell did they get moose into the middle east?"" Trump asked, incredulous. ""How did they do that? The explosion? They did that?""

""Milk bags,"" declared the Secretary of Defense. ""They presented bags of milk to the ISIS leaders as a peace offering and sign of friendship. Apparently the bags were filled with a chemical agent that exploded on contact with oxygen. The bags were porous, able to let some oxygen in at very little increments. A literal time bomb.""

Silence fell over the Situation Room. Trump, his skin a blue-green color, mostly from the light of the screen reflecting off his features, and partly because of the news he had just received. The Vice President loosened his tie.

""The Canadians killed every single ISIS leader in one single attack,"" the Secretary of Defense said, letting the video play to the point of the mushroom cloud again. ""It's over.""

""And you know this how?"" Trump asked, eyes still on the screen.

""The Canadians told us everything moments after the attack. How they did it, the chemicals they used, everything. I feel like... like it was threatening in nature, Mr President. Like they wanted to intimidate us.""

Trump squinted his eyes at the now blank screen, a thought forming in his head. One that included border protection and a new wall, farther to the north.",xsp4rrow

But joke or not, they came.  First in rafts, setting off from the mainland.  Then a hijacked cruise vessel, stolen off the coast of Somalia, loaded up with soldiers in Syria, fleeing the combined Russian and American counterstrike against Turko-Syria.

ISIS had been losing ground for years, unable to fight the west from without or the Kurds from within.  They were desperate.  So when the prince of our tiny island nation announced that he would be providing asylum to the last of their fighters, they took it.  Even if it was just a joke by a crazy old man.

They came in droves, unloading onto the platform from ships of every shape and size.  321 in July.  507 in August.  and on September 15th, a final load of 848 fighters, loaded with over three tons of various equipment.

Summary of Binding Opinion as to International Dispute 432/2016

29 January 2016

History of Proceedings

On 12 August 2015 the State of Japan filed formal protest with this court over alleged copyright infringement by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (""ISIL""), claiming that ISIL's ""martyrdom strategy"" trespasses on the intellectual property of the State of Japan under the alternative trademark of ""kamikaze."" The Republic of Ireland, Commonwealth of Australia, United States of America, and Canada then joined the suit to seek an international injunction against ISIL's use of the trade-name ""martyrdom,"" citing the creation of new alcoholic beverages that have become popular in those countries over the last few years.

Findings

The martyrdom strategy of ISIL is substantially similar to the State of Japan's intellectual property insomuch as is required for protection under international copyright law. It is the order of this court that ISIL immediately desist in its use of the trademarked kamikaze strategy. The crossclaims of the other claimant countries are hereby dismissed.

He sprinted toward the alley and crouched down low behind the overturned vehicle.  Hastily, he fumbled around for a spare magnum, coming up empty. He reminisced back to the days long ago, days when the bringing about of the Day of Judgement seemed so close within reach.  A huge wall of fire swept past him down the main street of the city, and the echoing screams of his dying ISIS comrades pierced his ears.

Kadeem ground his teeth together, gnashing them, crashing them together in frustration as the tears welled up in his eyes.  ""We could never have defeated them.""  He thought to himself. ""We never stood a chance.""

He was pulled from his grief by a voice calling ""Uncle!"" and he looked up.  A young man with a scar on his face was standing by, his weapon-less hand outstretched as if targeting his prey.  And older, bearded man with a kind face stood behind him.  Kadeem pulled up his gun, and tried to fire off a round.  *click.*  Empty.

 ""My young prince."" said the older gentleman in a calm, collected voice, soothing like a pot of warm tea. ""He is no threat to us now.  We should take him as a captive"".  The stern, cold gaze of disdain that the young warrior cast on Kadeem was a pitiless one.  He turned his back and turned away.  ""I don't care.  He's not the one I'm looking for anyway to restore my honor.""  

He motioned a hand to several other troops, who rushed down the alley, surrounding Kadeem.  The old man followed him, muttering something about tea.  At one point, Kadeem reflected, he believed he would have been the one standing in their place.  Standing and waiting to end the life of a worthless foe who stood in the way of his god.  

Kadeem could feel the heat beginning to build, and he closed his eyes, awaiting the inevitable.  Yes, at one point, he reflected, they had indeed been victorious, moving faster and forward in their conquest.

Immigrants, weirdos, and living in filth described his young life. As he grew up, he was at first feared, then people started recognizing his deep, old man wisdom. Eventually, he gained many loyal friends, and others sought him out for his insight.

The ISIS problem had disturbed him greatly, occupying more and more of his private musings, as he sat in the filth at the entrance to an alley. Something must be done. A grim, stern look grew across his face. His unblinking eyes finally made a decision.

He would fight ISIS, man to man, one at a time.

Miraculously, it worked, because he was Oscar the Grouch, and the cookie monster had his back. Over and over they grabbed and stuffed terrorist after terrorist into Oscars bottomless trashcan. They attacked, well, like monsters. When they got shot, well, theyre puppets, bullets pass right through them, and  they just kept fighting. When times got hard, Mr Snuffaluffagus would plow through their ranks like Mrs Piggy in menopause. Big Bird handled resupply, and The Count worked the night operations, killing 1, 2, 3.... terrorists, his cackles pierced the night and made the terrorists yearn for the days when Gordon would tell a bedtime story instead of call in airstrikes from those aliens in the manamana videos.

In the end, many puppets were lost. On quiet nights in Northern Syria, if you sit still and use your manners and listen quietly, you can sometimes still hear : 'Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sessame Street?'

I was the first to see the news, at least in my house, that is. I'd woken at six to get to school early. Some work I needed to get done was on the computer network but I suppose that doesn't matter anymore. I'm writing this from my phone. I managed to hide it when they took all our stuff, though I'm now wondering if the discomfort when sitting with a phone in your crack is even worth being able to contact family and friends. Itches something real bad, I'll tell ya.

All the guy on the TV was saying was that ""an unknown and very powerful military operation"" had ""totally vanquished the terrorist threat"". That was genuinely the end of this guy's piece - ""the terrorist threat"". It felt really vague but so oddly worded, like the media was trying to grandstand on behalf of this ""unknown"" group. It didn't take me long to figure out why, thanks to Reddit. This site, it has most news from most places almost straight away, at least in some form, and usually that form is its truest, which is what I was really looking for. The post wasn't too big when I found it. A few hundred upvotes, but I could tell it was gonna blow up sooner or later. Its title just read, ""North Korea storms ISIS."" and it linked to a liveleak video that was, and I shit you not here, *twenty-six hours long*.

I didn't even think videos could get that long on that site. Like any sane person would, I notified my mother, who was just coming downstairs, that I was terribly ill and couldn't go in today - I guess that's funny in hindsight. I wouldn't have been in school for very long. She was fine, my father never cared whether I went to school or not, and I knew whatever this video revealed was gonna be more interesting than trying understand partial fractions. I clicked play.

I turned to look for him, but all I could see was the trickle of water carving through a channel of dirt and rock.

""Yuosouff?"" I shouted, ""Where are you?""

With my hands full, I tried to walk back up the bank. My foot slipped on a rock, slick with moisture, and one of the pots dropped from my arm, and splashed into the murky water.

I turned to go retrieve it, when I heard Yousouff again. There was something wrong with his voice. It took me a moment to realize *he was crying.*

""No-o-o,"" came a muffled moan, ""No, please. Forgive me.""

Back in the sodomite cities, before God's Will leveled them, I heard the moans of men leaving the drinking houses. At first, this is what I believed: that my holy brother Youssouf had been *drinking*. 

I clambered to the top of the bank, and I saw him kneeling in the mud by the curve of the river. His robes were dripping with water, and his hands were held up in supplication, like a poor man begs for scraps of food.

In front of him, was a woman. An *uncovered* woman. 

I fought back my sinful instincts, and refused to set my eyes upon her. I called out to my brother across the river, like my father used to call to me when I had done wrong, ""Youssouf! You sinner! Come here!""

""No!"" he moaned, and he planted his hands in the mud, bowing before the whore-woman. She stood proud over him, her tattered, black clothes shifting over her torso, and revealing the sinful sight of skin.

""No,"" he shouted, ""I did not know! Please, forgive me!""

A shock of water lapped at my feet. I took a few steps back.

""Youssouf! Get away from that whore!"" I shouted, ""God will not forgive you!""

I stomped my foot, and splashed my robes with water. *Water*.

The stream was rising. Across the stream I watched Youssouf clutch at the woman's shredded clothing, tears running down his face. His body shook with tremors. Despite the rising water, he did not move from the stream, and the bottom of his robe was transparent with water. 

""Please, please forgive us!"" he clawed at his hair, at his chest, ""Please forgive *me!*""

The woman's face was stone. Her black hair was a beacon of darkness in the noonday sun, and her lips barely moved when she talked, though I could hear every word.

""You have blasphemed the Birthplace of the Gods. You have dragged the name of the Queen of Egypt through the mud.""

And then, her clothes lifted to reveal the bronzed, *naked* form beneath - for they were not clothes at all, but the *wings* of a vast, black bird. 

""Heathens!"" She screeched, and I clapped my hands over my ears, ""You will all know the true name of the Queen of Egypt! You will fear to drink of her waters, lest she drown you in your own filth!""

""Youssouf,"" I called out, ""Stand up and come to me!""

There was a distant booming, as a flood of water made it's way down the channel.

""God, forgive me. God, *forgive me!*"" Youssouf moaned, as the water lapped at his torso. He was kneeling still, like his legs were sealed to the ground.

""For all you have done, God may forgive you,"" the woman seethed, ""But *Isis* will not.""

A thundering torrent of water slammed against the curve of the bank, and swallowed Youssouf alive.

We don't take each others word on it, and no side has cried foul (less some issues with Syria).  
We're not there yet, but it's a good step towards a good place.

[WP] The Islamic State is wiped out by a totally unexpected country in a totally unexpected way.,chinli,"The E4 Programme was revolutionary, but like most harbingers of change, it went largely unnoticed. There was no BBC special...no world reports. It was hardly even noticed in the nation that launched it. In 2001, under the leadership of the socialist party's President Jorge Sampaio, Portugal's Energy Efficiency and Endogenous Energies Programme was launched to push the Portuguese economy into the 21st century, and modernize its social fabric^[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy_in_Portugal#Biogas). The environmental benefits helped, of course, but it's most striking impact wouldn't be felt for fifteen years. 

In that same year, on September 11th, seemingly unrelated events were unfolding across the Atlantic that would set the tiny coastal nation of Portugal on a path no one could have imagined. The terrorist attack on America's World Trade Center and Pentagon forever altered the path of the modern world. By 2003 America launched a full-scale invasion of Iraq, deposed the Sunni dominated government of Saddam Hussein, and brought a decade of sectarian violence and instability that would eventually allow for the rise of the Islamic State. 

None of this could be expected in 2001, however. The E4 Programme was a multifaceted approach with the goal of diversifying Portugal's energy consumption through efficient and renewable sources. These included hydro power, wind power, solar power, geothermal power, wave power, and biogas. By 2010, renewable energy was was the source of 45% of the country's electricity generation, an increase of 28% in five years^[2](http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&amp;address=115x288050). 

It was the biogas, though, that proved to be the undoing of the Islamic State. Portugal certainly wasn't the only nation producing biogas, however by 2016 it was the uncontested leader resulting from tremendous breakthroughs in efficient development processes. With other renewable energy producers providing more than enough to fuel the Portuguese domestic sector, the Portuguese biogas industry was ready to export.

Following successful IS inspired attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, and an attempted sarin gas attack in Berlin that was foiled by a joint CIA/BND effort^[3](http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/dec/27/homeland-recap-season-five-episode-12-false-glimmer), the entire western world was on edge. Portugal's President Aníbal Cavaco Silva and his cabient had an idea. It was a long shot, but they felt it had a better chance of success than the endless air campaigns that NATO was launching against ISIS. Recent events had proven that this only fueled the radical state. 

ISIS had persisted and grown stronger largely off the finances received from oil sales; Silva aimed to undercut those sales. Massive efforts were put into flooding the Middle Eastern market with biogas stocks at cheap prices. It took only months before ISIS started feeling the pressure. As funding dried up, so too did recruits. Within the year the professionally produced propaganda videos the world had grown used to devolved into shoddy amateur recordings in basements. Soon there were only unconfirmed audio recordings. By 2018 the world had all but forgotten about the existential threat that ISIS once posed. 

Peace, sadly, was still not on the table. While the world was elated and genuinely grateful for Portugal's innovative and creative solution to the ISIS threat, the established oil interests were now threatened. It wouldn't be long until oil lobbyists were slowly changing the political narrative, and setting their sights on the small coastal European nation that solved the crisis from which they had been profiting from for years.

[WP] The Islamic State is wiped out by a totally unexpected country in a totally unexpected way.,chinli,"The Islamic State was always an unexpected insurrection, taking swaths of land from the Syrian Government, their opposition, the Iraqi Government and the Kurds during the Syrian Civil War. Years later, in time, Syrian and Iraqi government forces from the South and the Kurdish forces from the North have continued to squeeze down and take back ground from ISIS, but supply routes from Turkey and stolen money from Iraq have made the jihadis quite a formidable foe to fight. Even after the horrifying attacks in Paris, and the airstrikes conducted by Coalition Forces in support of the Kurds and Rebels, ISIS still wouldn't budge, and their morale would never break.

That was until early 2016. Within several weeks, ISIS was completely eliminated. Surveillance from coalition UAVs were not able to identify those who were responsible for eliminating ISIS all over Syria and Iraq. Even as Kurdish, Syrian and Iraqi forces took back a whole lot of their ground and some groups claimed responsibility for all of it, it was never ever confirmed until the war came to a close in late 2016, where most of the parties involved in the Syrian Civil War came to a ceasefire.

""Mr. President, the Director of National Intelligence to see you.""

""Yes, thank you, Barbara, send him in.""

A moment later, the Director stepped into the Oval Office, closing the door firmly behind him. The President's questions began as soon as the latch clicked. 

""Another partial detonation?""

""Three, sir."" The director replied, ""NUDET sensors on the GPS constellation just confirmed another south-east of Al Hasakah 11 minutes ago. Judging by the low-yield of the initial detonation, and the substantial amount of radioactive fallout we're detecting, we believe them to be partial or failed detonations, similar to the others, sir.""

""My God. That's 21 in less than a week. All three were ISIS locations?"" This was the question that had been worrying the President most these last 5 days. The prospect of a nuclear terrorist attack against civilians was not a pleasant one. 

""Two for sure, one at a training facility, and another at a weapons depot. The second detonation occurred on a remote highway, far from any civilian population centers. We believe that device was in transport.""

""In transport? Why would ISIS set off a nuclear bomb in the middle of nowhere?""

""I don't believe they did, sir, at least, not intentionally. I've just received the report on the device we captured outside of Sinjar, in Iraq. If I may, sir?"" The Director asked, pulling a document from an inner jacket pocket. 

The President gestured to a chair, and the Director sat.

""Sir, the Sinjar device bore the flag of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, painted on the hood.""

""North Korea is selling nuclear weaponry to ISIS? I'll put that fat little bastard in the ground for this. Wait, did you say 'hood'?""

""Yes, sir. The device's outer shell appears to be a Pyeonghwa, a North Korean car. The flag was painted on the hood.""

""A drivable North Korean nuclear bomb? Are you kidding me? Earlier this year, they could barely fit their bombs into a hollow mountain!""

""No, sir. The vehicle was gutted to make room for the device components. It appears that the vehicle is just a shell, likely chosen because of availability. DPRK party members wealthy enough to own cars generally prefer European makes, and Pyeonghwa's distribution is almost non-existent.""

""Alright, what else?"" The President was flabbergasted. 

""Well, sir, the report notes extensive use of plywood, corrugated steel sheeting, and duct tape in the device's construction. Radiation containment around the plutonium core is entirely absent. The detonator is partially mechanical in nature, comprised of, and I'm quoting here, 'what appears to be a Rube Goldberg machine cobbled together from a series of ramps, a bowling ball, a roller skate, a pair of scissors, two candles, and one fully inflated balloon'"". 

""A balloon?"" Asked the President incredulously.

""A balloon, sir. The report further notes that this device is incredibly fragile.""

""Do you mean to tell me, Director, that the North Koreans are building nuclear weaponry out of *whatever they happen to have laying around*?""

""It appears that way, sir. We believe that the recent string of partial detonations have all been entirely accidental, caused either by mishandling by ISIS personnel, or sheer poor design. Technical analysis indicates that, once armed, the device could explode at any time, for no apparent reason.""

""And ISIS squirreled them away inside their own facilities. Those idiots! They're literally slaughtering themselves with their own, and North Korea's, incompetence! What's the damage assessment on the other detonation sites?"" The President was very close to smiling now. After a week of worry, this news was good beyond his wildest dreams. 

""Well, sir, the lack of shielding on the devices means that any ISIS personnel standing unprotected within about 20 feet of the device will have received a lethal dose of radiation within a few minutes, though the full affects can take a week or more to run their course. Effects of the detonation are relatively minor for a nuclear device, the initial blast radius is perhaps a few blocks in radius. The fact that these are partial detonations, however, means that the fallout will do significant damage, raining radioactive dust on everything within 5 miles, depending on prevailing winds. Lethal doses of radiation in these areas will be achieved in perhaps 15 minutes. And that's not to mention the extreme toxicity of plutonium itself. The death toll within 5 miles of a detonation will be near 100%, sir.""

""Dirty bombs, then.""

""Very dirty, sir.""

""Director, how much damage has the Islamic State's stupidity done to it's cause thus far?""

""Sir, we estimate that 90 to 95 percent of ISIS's operational capability, including personnel and matériel, lies within 3 miles of at least one detonation. Even if they're able to replace the personnel, their equipment will remain lethally radioactive for decades.""

""This is good news, Director."" The President said, finally allowing a smile to break free. 

""Very good news, sir."" The Director replied. 

""Alright, then, please keep me posted. If you'll excuse me, I've got to get Kim Jong Un on the phone. First, to thank him. Then, to tell him to kiss his little puppet kingdom good bye.""

[WP] I died today. This is how.,xysyx_,"It wasn't always going to end the way it did. That's what I told myself as I lay there, on the cusp of non-beingness, thinking about things I hadn't thought before and weren't like to think about in the future. I wanted to touch upon it all, to open my mouth wide open and gobble up the world, no, the universe, its strangeness and its familiarity and the notions that are too powerful even to bear the name of a word; I wanted every fresh and combustible sensation of taste to last forever. There was, however, nothing new in that. 

My grandma used to say that I had too much of a penchant for adventure. My impetuous habit of getting into trouble would be the end of me. Or as she put it: Someday soon I'd break my fool neck, and she wasn't going to be sorry about it neither. She called it like she saw it. Grandma was my favorite. 

The day I died she had been long dead. My mother and father too, though they went before. I had a sister, but I hadn't spoken to her in years. I don't know where she is or what she is doing with her life. Sometimes, when one of those moods take me, I try to close my eyes and imagine. She is always the same then, smiling in a way I don't think I ever saw her smile. There she is making some grand creation in a great flower-tiled kitchen, or taking a walk with what must be her kid, leading him up a grassy hillock, or having the back of her hand kissed by a man in a suit who obviously cares for her. I, on the other hand, didn't particularly care for her during those final years. I thought about her from time to time, and sometimes I even caught myself mouthing a prayer for her well-being. It was almost as if it had become an inveterate habit to reminisce about her, like I would sometimes reminisce about Grandma. It hadn't always been like that. 

We were like twins when we were growing up. We looked alike and we thought alike. Even our names sounded similar. Emma and Emmett, The Conquerors of the World. We'd say it in a bright officious chorus and then we'd laugh like kids laugh, not realizing that the silence that follows is bittersweet. Whenever we had guests we'd delight ourselves by dressing up in each other's clothes to pretend. It used to fascinate me, how they treated me differently when they thought I was a girl. It was like I had shorn a hole into my mattress and fallen through, and there was the world, almost exactly as it had been before but inverted like the image of a mirror, and every physical reaction had been brought about by a cause that was just slightly off. At first I enjoyed it. But it was I who called it off in the end. Emma, I think, would have been perfectly happy to go on playing me forever. 

This story just became structurally complicated, and I'm not in the mood. Thanks if you read, though, and sorry for the total absence of any form of payoff. ",ThatSweetSpote

You put this out, and his legacy is just-"" The man puffed air through his lips and waved his arms in the air. He took a deep breath, ""I know, I know.

"[WP] You live in a world where every year on your birthday, you are given the option of advancing to the next age or staying the same age for another year.",Kcb1986,"You wake up.

It's that time of year. You've once again made it through 364-ish days, you've gone through the motions, you've seen people come and go. You've laughed, cried, tried, failed, succeeded and grown.

But that's nothing compared to every other day. The days where all your efforts is for naught, so why bother? Why even get out of bed? Even when you do, even when you want to congratulate yourself for having the courage to face a day void of hope and life, you find that just trying to find the energy drains you even more.

And now you're here. But what do you do? Where do you go? Do you try again? Do you try to believe that, with just one more time, you can get it right? That you can transform your life into something worth living?

Or is this the year you give up and stop trying? Is this the year that you allow yourself to march a step closer to the end? Even if you do, what will you do next year?

You sit on the edge of your bed, trying to force these thoughts out of your mind. This is a happy day, your next day of choosing! And yet.

The choice seems inhumane.

You never wanted to choose.

And now you must.

What will you choose?",Minty_Milk_Straw
"[WP] You live in a world where every year on your birthday, you are given the option of advancing to the next age or staying the same age for another year.",Kcb1986,"It had always been such an easy decision.

The first few years, of course, the decision had not been mine. The parents have to choose, until their child passes the General Ageing Competency Standardised Test, whether or not they are going to age. Most do, although there are always a few couples — some single parents too — who prefer to keep their babies with them forever. I can’t imagine why; years of changing nappies doesn’t sound like fun to me. And the breastfeeding! Yeesh.

Once I was old enough, I could choose for myself. My first one was my fifth birthday. I don’t remember much else from when I was that age, but I do remember proudly putting the stamp in the ‘yes’ box on the form; I remember being so careful not to go outside the edges. It seemed like such a dumb question — like, what four-year-old wouldn’t want to be five? I think I was maybe scared that saying no would mean I didn’t get a party, too. I loved parties when I was little, wearing a pretty dress and being treated like a princess for a day.

The decision didn’t change over the years. I remember thinking once, why does everyone act like it’s such a big deal? Being older than you are is always going to be better. I don’t even know why they bother to ask, making you fill in the same dumb form every year, with witnesses and everything.

I look back now and wonder how I could ever have been so naive.


The natural bumps happen at the nines. Not nine-year-olds, of course, and not many nineteen-year-olds decide to refuse — you want to be able to order a beer, wherever you end up — but there are definite population clusters around the twenty-nine, thirty-nine age groups; people, both women and men, who just couldn’t face entering a new decade. I can understand. You’re fit, healthy, probably the most attractive you’ll ever be, you still have all your own teeth — why not stop there? Subtly, government and industry encourage this sort of thinking too; they want fit young people to work in their fields, their factories, and fight in their wars.

Me, I blew through forty and fifty with nary a backward glance. As I approached sixty years of age, the doctors’ visits became more frequent. They told me about all of the scary things that could happen, the diseases that came with age that nobody knew how to cure. I laughed at them — I was still having fun. It turns out that quite a few twenty-nine men have a thing for women in their sixties. Who knew?

Still standing, he shoveled a small amount into his mouth and judged the temperature of his meal.  “Mm,” he hummed, approving of Mother’s cooking.

“Nah,” Sam said and leaned forward in his chair, sponging up the last bit of golden yolk from his plate.  “Just the usual stuff.”

“Oh, if you want it at Dave McLazer’s again, you’ll have to make reservations,” Mother reminded, scraping burnt egg  and cheese from a pan.

“Yeah!” Sam’s eyes lit up.

“Uh huh,” Father sat down. “Going to spend another year at thirteen or you think you might want to advance this year?”

“Honey,” Mother said.

“What?” Father took a sip of his coffee. “I’m just asking,” he said.

“Well,” Sam crunched on his last piece of toast.  “I think I’ll stay at thirteen for one more year…”

“All your friends are, what, twenty-five, twenty-six, now?”

“No… I mean... Some of them are like seventeen.  One of them is, like five, still, I think.” Sam hunched, avoiding eye contact.

“Well, you know your sister is twenty-three already…  I mean, she’d be willing to help you out if you want to grow up at all,” Father said.

“I know…”

“She did one age a year, like they used to do it,” Father reminded him.  “Didn’t waste her time.”

“I’m not wasting my time. I’m just not ready to be fourteen, yet.”

“And that’s fine,” Mother turned off the faucet, loudly splashing water.

“Donny Majors Jr. was thirteen for ten years,” Sam brought his plate to the sink and left it on the counter, by mom.  Sam leaned against the counter, crossing his arms.

“Donny who?”

“Captain Fireblast.”

“Wh- So what’s great for him.  But, that’s not some formula for success.”

“I’m not saying it’s a formula for success!” Sam huffed.

“I’m not saying you’re saying it’s a formula for success!” Father huffed back.

“Come on, you two,” Mother sighed.

“I don’t get it,” Father held up his video screen and tapped on the word News.  “I was thirteen, I don’t see the big deal.  Really, the fun is in your twenties,” Dad chuckled.  “Wish I stopped at twenty-two.  See now that I’d understand.”

“Dad.”

“But, thirteen?”

“Dad.”

“You can’t even drive a car, yet.  Aren’t you embarrassed that all your friends are driving cars and getting married and you’re still watching Captain Firebolt movies?”

“Ron,” Mother said, placing Sam’s plate in the sink.  “That’s enough.”

“What?” Father said, innocently.

“Aunt Linda told me how long you’ve been alive, dad.”

“What’s that supposed to mean?”

“It means you’re full of crap with all of this. Aunt Linda was a born when you were ten and now she’s like ninety-seven.  I did the math, dad.”

“Sam,” Mother said.

“What?  He’s full of it!”

“Hey, watch your mouth,” Father stood up.  “Maybe if you grew up a little bit you’d learn not to use that kind of language!”

“I said ‘it!’”

“He said, ‘it,’” Mother confirmed.

“He said crap, before!” Father pointed his finger at Sam, yet spoke to Mother. Then, he looked to Sam and said, “Now go to your room!”

“No!”

“Oh, you’re going to be an asshole?  How about no Davey Lazers for your birthday?”  
Defeated and embarrassed, Sam stormed into his room, slamming his door.  After a satisfying punch into his bed, Sam sat down at his computer.  He opened a web browser and stared at the empty search engine.  After several minutes, Sam brought his fingers to the keyboard and typed:

[WP]Perfectionist supervillain struggles to finish the ultimate weapon.,Kinrany,"I am Deathstroyer!  I am the coming apocalypse!  I am the death that will cleanse this world!  I AM… all out of purple high gloss paint?  Seriously?  How did I let this I happen?


I drop my weary head into my hands and just sigh.  Sitting on the workbench in front of me my Deathstroyer brand HyperDeathBeam is all but finished.  I even managed to finally get the beam to obliterate only human life without destroying plants or causing explosions.  I only wanted to destroy the city and leave it an empty playground.  The beam works exactly as I want it, but it’s such an ugly flat gray.  


I stand up and make my way over to the cabinet of supplies in the corner of my lair.  Surely I have to have something else in there.  Five hundred jars of paint, all the wrong color.  Hell, there’s even a matte purple in there taunting me with it’s uselessness.  The glossy purple was color matched specifically to the beam it produces *and* my cape.  It was perfect.


Leaning back from the cabinet I close my eyes and replay the mental fantasy I’ve been harboring for years.  It is a familiar dream and has been seeing me through this project.  Picturing all the despicable humans of the city running in terror from the flying Deathstroyer, with his bright purple gun and it’s neon purple beam.  They’d run, they flee, but nothing would save them from the peril I wrought!  MUWHAHAAHAHAHA.  


Oh damn, I started laughing out loud again.  I’m glad no one was here to hear that.  I guess I have no choice; I’ll have to pick up some more paint.  I’ll bet the Merchant of Deathness never forgot to have enough paint.  Now there’s a real villain.  I’ll never be as good as him.  


After grabbing the keys to the Deathmobile, I start fiddling with my cape to take it off.  Wait, no, screw that.  I’m not changing out of my costume.  I AM the Deathstroyer.  The rest of the world needs to accept me for who I am.  In response to this, a small twinge of embarrassment runs down spine and straight into my crotch.  I feel almost vulgar the way my suit looks like I’m wearing woman’s underwear on the outside.  


No, I will do this.  I’ve put more time into being a villain than most people put into any of their hobbies.  I can do this.  I hold my head up defiantely, walk out the door and into destiny.



I’m two blocks into my trip in the Deathmobile before I remember I’m heading to Michaels.  Those woman can be downright vicious when they give you a dirty look.  My defiant sneer turns into a glum frown.  Oh well, too late to change now.  The city moves by in a blur as I head onwards.


I love my Deathmobile.  The giant skull on the back means no one tailgates me.  Spikes on the wheels means no one can box me in when they park beside me.  Screw headlights, I have flame throwers on the front to light my path.  Nevermind it ruins the gas mileage.  Sadly, it’s enormous size, coupled with the business of a Saturday, means I have to park at the far end of the lot.  My lower eyelid starts twitching; it does that any time I get really worked up.  There’s only one thing that can raise my spirits now, I need to monologue.



“DEATHSTROYER has come again!” I bellow out once I am outside of my car.  “Wherever Deathstroyer goes, pain and anguish follow!  A foul curse is descending upon you Michaels and your reasonably priced craft supplies.  I enter your void now!”



There, I feel better.  Though, I’m not quite sure what it means to enter a store’s void, it just sounded good in the moment.  Across the parking lot, I see a scrawny teenager that was watching my monologue.  He pulls out his phone and starts jogging over.  Oh god, last time that happened they wanted to take a “selfie” with me.  I cannot allow that.  


Quickly, I pull my cloak around me and float on into the Michaels.  I hear the teenager call to me, he too shall learn the truth; Deathstroyer waits for no one.  



Once inside the store, the fluorescent lights sap my energy and bleaches the environment to a terrible ashen grey.  I make a mental note to look up the inventor of the fluorescent bulbs; truly an evil genius that has mastered the art of long term subtle evil.  As I walk the aisles, I’m visually scorned by all manner of woman and their craft addictions.  A portly woman in the unpainted lumber section glares at me, a tiny spry old lady in the puzzles sections looks at me with contempt, a mother and daughter looking at holiday directions whisper quietly to each other while staring at me with venom.  


I am a villain, I live to be hated and feared by others.  Yet these women unnerve me so with their looks that say I am intruding in their domain.  I must get out of here as quickly as possible.  

It is not difficult task for Deathstroyer, he who brings the death, to find the appropriate paint, navigate their accursed fluorescent light filled maze of shelves and get to the exit.  I was, however, unprepared for the questions that would bring.


“Do you have one of our Bonus Rewards Cards?”  The chipper blonde working the register asks me.  Looking around at the other cashiers it’s obvious that she is despised for her beauty and grace where she stands peerless above the other slovenly workers here.  It is also obvious that she is oblivious to the scorn of her peers as she smiles at me innocently.  Her smile reminds me of a doe right before it is killed to death by one of my HyperDeath beams. 


“Sir, do you have one of our Bonus Reward Cards?” She asks again.  Oh bother, this is a question I am supposed to answer.


“I… do not know.”


“That’s no problem.  I can lookup your details in the computer.  What’s your name.”


“DEATHSTROYER!  Bringer of Pain--”


“Dithstraw?  Is that german?”


“No, DEATHSTROYER!”


“Ohh, Deathstroyer,” she giggles at saying the name, “Is that your first or last name?”


“Neither, it is MY name.”


“Yeah, european names are funny like that.  How about I use your number.  Can you tell me that, area code first?”


What in the devil is an area code?  I destroy areas!  Finally, I can take more.


“A pox upon your computer and it’s infernal questions!” I shout.  Without hesitation I point my finger and activate the Death Laser in the glove.  The case of the computer expands and boils before rupturing in a satisfying orgy of smoke and fire.  That felt good.


The girl’s eyes went wide at this.  Without looking away from the smoldering remains of her machine, she grabs the phone next to her and pages on the overhead comm “Manager key needed at front lane.”


Managers!  This is getting complicated; last time a Manager was beckoned I was banned from the food court.  I’d better go.  Quickly I fish out what seems a reasonable amount of gold coins for the paint and toss it on the counter.


“Enjoy your respite mortals!  Deathstroyer leaves you now!”  I call out half-heartedly.  


On the walk back to the car I start doing the mental calculations to figure out how long until my HyperDeathBeam is complete.  I realize with traffic there’s no way I’ll have it done in time.  I really wanted to attack during the sunset today; my cape just looks so fearsome against the golden setting sun.  Oh well, maybe I’ll have it done by tomorrow.

Arthur and his trainee Remy sat at their desks, overlooking the server bay. Lines of black boxes, and the faint hum of their activity filled the room. 

*A3-249 just got another hangup.* Arthur said, lazily throwing his head back and rubbing his eyes. *It's just rude.* He chuckled.

No, I thought that it had to be. I refused to see the truth. I had taken on dozens of crime organizations. No matter how many times I failed, I could repeat time within a ten minutes of the incident. It didn’t matter how many bullets were shot my way, nor how many times I was charged at. Every shot, every strike, I could block. They called me invincible, and my power made me feel as though this was true.

Countless times I repeated the same ten minutes. And every time I struggled against my foe. Every time I faced it, I found myself at the end of it all without having gained a thing. This was my 1,020th attempt, and now all I could do was grab at my hair in frustration. Tears slid down my cheeks as I felt, for the first time in my life, hopeless. 

Her soft hand reached for my knee again. I could see the veins under her skin. It was no longer sun kissed, nor shared resemblance to the dandelion field where we first met. Despite how much pain she was in, how little she had left, she still remained herself; she still cared for me.

Her voice was as weak as ever, yet it still was music to my ears. I lifted my tired gaze to my beloved, her pale face as beautiful as the rising sun. “Yes, my dear?” I found myself croaking out once more, a fake smile upon my face. Despite how many times we have had this conversation, it’s still difficult to speak the words. 

“How many times… has it been now?” She asked. She was always too smart, too intelligent. She was the one who had held me aloft in the world whenever I felt lost. And she knew me the best; she had to. 

This time I remained silent. My gaze drifted; I couldn’t see her reaction. 
I felt her frail fingers rub against my knee. I could hear the faintness in her voice. It wouldn’t be long now.

“You’ve got to let me go, Sariel… You’ve got to...“


Her soft hand reached for my knee again. I had to change this, I had to find a way to save her. This was my 1,021st attempt…

[WP] You are a hero with the power to infinitely reset a fight until you win. Describe a fight so hopeless even you cannot win.,Sivcere,"In his time The Silver Barrel was regarded as the best hero around. Villains feared to face him, for they would always be defeated. It was often described as remarkable, if not God-like. No matter the precautions or actions that were taken to defeat him he always came out on top. It was miraculous, really. Traps that were so expertly hidden it would be hard for machines to find were avoided by him as if he had known all along. Even weapons used against him were so expertly dodged, it was as if he knew exactly where they would be shooting every time!
	
But of course, this was in his prime. It has been a long time since he hung the cape up. Roughly twenty years, actually. He’s settled down now. Took himself a wife, had a beautiful little daughter, gotten a nice job downtown at shoemaker. All was good. However, there are rumors he is having to take down the cape one last time…
	
“Daddy?” The small girl gently tugged on her father’s cape as he holstered his silver pistol. “Do you really have to go?” The man knelt down to come face to face with his daughter, a weary smile enveloping his face.
	
“I promise I’ll be back.” The child’s face screwed up into sadness before wrapping her arms around his neck to hug him. His arms went around her body, returning the hug tightly. “I’ll be back tomorrow.” She nodded before letting go, taking a step away from him. “Be good for Mommy.”
	
“I will Daddy.” And with that he tousled her hair, turning to step out of the door. A click indicated it had shut behind him, and he was able to let go of the breath he had been holding to make his chest puff slightly. This was it. One final fight. With clenched teeth he began sprinting down the street as his arms pumped with each breath.
	
“You aren’t going to win!” With each step he found his determination growing more and more. “I can beat you!” The clenched teeth slowly transformed into a grin as people stopped to stare at him running. They all knew him from so long ago, but none of them knew what was coming. Many muttered in awe and wonder. The Silver Barrel had returned! Too bad it was for just one last fight…
	
Eventually he came to stand on top of a grassy hill that looked out across the city. This exact spot had been where he met his wife. He enjoyed returning here often, to relive memories and comfort himself. It was always there, waiting with open arms. “One last time, eh?” His chest began to tighten. He could feel the heart in his chest begin beating slower and slower, pedaling down to a complete stop. With a final gasp of air, everything went black….
	
He came to stand on top of a grassy hill, his eyes scanning out across the city. He often took his daughter here for picnics in the summer. She loved it. So many wonderful memories… “One more time.” With agonizing pain he felt his chest start to tighten, the heart inside it coming to a close. He was beating his chest in attempt to make it start back up, watching the world around him fade away....
	
His feet stopped just short of the top of the hill. “Is it really worth it?” He found himself pondering this concept. No one knew, except for his wife, why he was able to always win. With a power like his it was impossible to lose. “Could it be.” He looked up to the sun above him, squinting his eyes in effort to see it as darkness enveloped. “I’ve met my match?”
	
...He found himself crawling up the hill in desperate grasps of grass. He fancied the idea that he was beginning to see a figure in a suit and tie standing at the top of the hill, eternally watching him struggle. “Why do you do this!?” The figure stayed silent as it’s icy flames of eyes stared down at him. “Do you enjoy it? Watching me… Suffer…” His head fell down onto the grass.
	
This time he didn’t even bother to climb the hill. With each instance he could see the figure becoming more and more tangible. How many times was it now? ***Nine-Hundred.*** “Nine-hundred… Huh?” Didn’t he just hear a voice? No, that couldn’t be right. No one had spoke. The world around them was completely and utterly silent. Too silent, actually…
	
…”Why me!?” ***Why anyone?*** There it was again! That damned voice inside of head! It was as if it was piercing his very mind, skipping going through the air and entering his brain directly. It was terrifyingly deep, yet held no details whatsoever. “Here we go again…”
	
This time he simply laid down onto the grass at the base of the hill, staring at the blue sky above. “If I keep trying I’ll eventually hit the probability of it not killing me.” No voice this time. Funny, he thought it would have something to say about that. A single bird’s song rang out across the field this time.
	
...***One in Infinity.*** “What?” ***You have one chance out of infinity to survive.*** “Of course I do.” He had come to accept that the voice was most likely a product of the figure. It was somehow oddly comforting knowing there was someone else here to watch his struggle. He had yet to ask the identity of the being, fearing the worst. ***Is it worth it?*** “Of course.”
	
This time he opted to stand still, staring behind him toward the city with its ever moving life. “Did you invent cancer? As an agent of your will?” ***No. My master did.*** “Who is your master?” ***She is the Omniscient.*** “That’s what I was afraid of.” Tears began to flow down his eyes before everything disappeared again…
	
“How many times is it now?” He was staring up the hill at the figure. ***I’m sorry?*** “You told me earlier it was Nine-hundred. How many now?” ***….Four-thousand.*** “Thank you.” He began to laugh madly, throwing his head back to cackle toward the sky. “How torturous your master must be!” ***Not torturous. Just curious.***
	
There were quite a few birds singing this time as he climbed the hill. “Does that mean we are just experiments? Play things for her?"" The figure refused to make eye contact this time, even refusing to answer. “Either you don’t know…” He sneered. “Or you would rather not say, fearing I’m correct.” ***Does it matter?***

“I guess not.” Crickets instead of birds this time. Odd, it wasn’t even night. “One out of infinity, huh?” ***Perhaps this is your Purgatory. Forever rewinding, reflecting on your life until you are comfortable with letting go. Or until you hit the chance.*** “Don’t you know the answer to that?” ***I know as little as you. I am only the agent of Her will.*** “Lovely..”
	
***Six-thousand four-hundred and eight.*** “I’m glad you could accompany me on this journey.” ***You’re not the first I have, and you will not be the last. Do not be flattered.*** “Let’s go again… I have to survive. For them.” His mind envisioned his daughter and his wife. “I’m coming home…”
	
***Six-thousand four-hundred and nine.***

[WP] A love story that starts and ends in 7 days. From strangers to strangers.,_aaargh,"The day I met Opal wasn't exactly special. It was an ordinary Saturday, overcast, a little nippy. Nippy enough to warrant a scarf, at least. Despite the chill, my whim compelled me to make an extra stop on my afternoon walk, between the post office and the grocery store. It was a place I'd visited before, and the residents were usually pleased to see me. Well, either that or asleep, but you know what I mean.

Opal was a new face that day. She was an older girl. I've heard many a time that the older ones have a lot more trouble getting adopted, and perhaps that swayed me, but I like to think the motive was unimportant. I knew from the moment I scratched the side of her face and got that gravelly meow out of her that I wanted to take her home.

The hard part was committing to do it. The shelter was closed on Sunday, but I paid visits Monday and Tuesday night of that week, and neither time could I work up the nerve to ask the staff about adoption. I couldn't, I told myself. I couldn't afford a cat. I would do better to put my money towards my student loans than cat food, litter, and my apartment's pet rent. I didn't visit on Wednesday. I couldn't make up my mind. But Wednesday night, before I went to bed, I finally said to myself, yes, I would do it. I would bring Opal home. I went and spoke with the staff of the apartment complex on Thursday to confirm the pet rent policy. I bought kibble, I bought a litter box, I bought a comb, I bought a feather on a stick and a laser pointer. I was going to do it, and I was going to be prepared.

I went in on Friday, and Opal was gone. The kindly woman at the desk told me that Opal had already been adopted. It took me a second to accept, but then I smiled as best I could, thanked the woman for her time, and left the shelter.

I'm happy for Opal, don't get me wrong. She has a loving family now, as she deserves. But that doesn't stop the sting in my chest.",Fuzzlewuzzlekins

[WP] A love story that starts and ends in 7 days. From strangers to strangers.,_aaargh,"I suppose it was her beauty that first caught my eye. The flawless skin, beautiful hair, striking eyes, she knew I had eyes for her from the start. Letting out a light chuckle as she saw the cigarette in my mouth go limp as my eyes followed her. Already I could tell she wasn't like the other girls around here, they'd of just ignored me and been on their way. 

I stood at the same place the next day, hoping she would be at the same place again. Sure enough she walked by again looking just as radiant. I clumsily tried a greeting only for her to laugh and answer me in accented English. It wasn't flawless but it was certainly stronger than my smattering of phrases. We walked around, I learned that she took care of her mother and younger sister and brother. She invited me to dinner and I accepted, a homecooked meal sounded almost as appealing as spending an evening with her. 

She told me I shouldn't bring anything, but what fun was having the connections to get anything you wanted if you couldn't use it to show off to pretty girls. Dinner went wonderfully, her mother was an amazing cook. Didn't even recognize most of the foods, and it was then I suddenly felt like I was in a fairy tale. The old me in America didn't try new things, do anything interesting. Now here I was in a foreign land, with an exotic woman, trying foods that nobody in my family had ever eaten. 

Her siblings were shy at first but after a while I could barely pay any attention to her with them looking through my things. The little brother looked familiar almost, probably saw him running around town while I was on duty. Her mother was a quiet, but beautiful woman. Didn-t have to ask where the father was, all too common a story these days.

The next two days she took me around to some of the sites to see. A lot of the locals looked at me with distrust, I guess these were the kind of places they didn't expect to see a white man. I tried my best to embrace the culture but it was difficult to look at the sites instead of her.

The next day I invite her to a restaraunt that's popular with the guys. I drop off some groceries when I pick her up. The evening goes well, some of the guys come up to introduce themselves and she charmed them. We were drinking, but she limited herself. I had more but limited myself to avoid being a fool. She gives me a kiss on the cheek when I drop her off at her home. I ask if tomorrow she can look at some stuff I'd acquired over the last few years.

Stupid I chided myself, so stupid. What good possibly could've come from showing her that stuff. I told her in the battle for the canal I'd killed an officer and had taken a few pf his things. She looked at me with disdain and I tried to backpedal, tried to tell her I wanted to find his family and return his effects. Tears sprang from her eyes when I pulled out the blade and journal. She lightly touched the blade and then used the same hand to slap me. She pointed at the blade ""my brother's"" she said. I suddenly wished my claim about wanting to return it had been genuine at the start. Maybe she'd of stayed, understood that in war people died. I feel like she could sense my dishonesty though, I'd taken those things as trophies to show off when I went back to the states.

She left me then and returned home. Wouldn't see me, I couldn't tell what her mom was saying when she kept me out but I got the hint. The next evening I went back for the last time. Her little brother was playing in the garden and I realized why he seemed familiar. I set his slain older brother's things on their doorstep and left. I didn't deserve to get the girl because heroes got the girl, and I was no hero. Maybe someday I could be though, and maybe giving that man's family back as much of their son as I could was a decent start.",tomathon25

The door slides shut. The street lamp highlights her lumpy silhouette as she trudges down the sodden path. This is the last time I’ll watch her leave. I’ll move on. There will be someone out there for me. Someone that understands.

Monday. 8:40am. 
Stunning. Absolutely stunning. I was in my usual spot finishing a coffee. A spot I’ve sat in a hundred times before but I’ve never seen her. The rain was lashing down, the wind grabbing at her dress while she gracefully prevented it from riding too high with carefully placed palms on her thighs. No jacket, no umbrella. She must live close. And probably works around here too. She saw me and cast a nervous smile, but there was something in it. Innocence but still the impression of an invitation deep in the eyes. There was something in it!

11:45pm. 
I saw her again. Different clothes, hair changed and walking the other direction. Out so late. Off to see her boyfriend no doubt. Silly of me for even thinking. Idiot. It was just a smile. There is no one out there for me.

Tuesday. 9am. 
I saw her again in the same clothes as last night. I just wanted to put the idea out my head for good so I followed her a little bit. I followed her to her flat. Small place, must be a one bed and no sign of boyfriend. It dawned on me she probably works a night shift somewhere. Maybe I’ll find out where later.
 
Wednesday. 8am. 
A really long night. I couldn’t get her out of my head yesterday. Why am I doing this to myself again? It turns out she works at a service station 5 minute from here. She must be new to the area or I would have seen her. Probably doesn’t have many friends or family yet. I sat close to her place this morning. Thought about how I could ‘bump’ into her and start a conversation. Maybe get a dog and have it jump up at her… dress as a delivery guy with a package for a neighbor. I’m useless when it comes to women. Instead I just sat there making up improbable situations for us to meet. 

9am. 
She works at a service station! I just need to go in and talk to her. I could build a relationship with her over time. Try and find out a bit more about her. Talk about her interests. I’m going to do it. I’m going to talk to the most beautiful girl I’ve ever seen. I’m going to be confident and she is going to fall in love with me. I’m doing it tonight. 

Thursday. 2am. 
Useless. 

11:30am. 
I couldn’t do it. I saw her leave her house, no dress today. Jeans. Still striking. I took my time. Went in around 1am and grabbed a 6 pack. ‘Just off to a house party’. Yes. Says I’m local, have friends, likes to have fun. ‘What time do you get off?  – maybe you can join’. Perfect line. ‘Oh you won’t finish until at least 7. I’ll be walking back then – maybe I can walk you home’. 

No. I stood there in silence. Handed her the beer and when she looked up at me I lowered my eyes to my feet. My pathetic shoes propping up a pathetic excuse for a man. She said nothing. Why would she. Look at me. I walked out the door. 

Friday. 6am. 
Am I in love with her? Or am I in love with an idea. A dream of getting out of this life. 

Friday. 2pm. 
I WILL talk to her tonight.

Saturday. 1am. 
She didn’t walk past tonight. She wasn’t at work. She wasn’t at home. Night off I guess. 

Sunday. 10am. 
It’s over. I don’t know why I thought things could be different. I was going to talk to her. I saw it all unfold. I got new clothes. We had our first date. I moved into her flat and then we saved up to get a bigger one with a second bedroom for our first child. Marriage. Love. 

I walked in and picked up a sick pack. Marched to the checkout head high. Placed down the beer, looked into her eyes. And froze. I just stared at her. I could see the pity in her eyes. No invitation. Just sadness at the wretch stood in front of her. Dirt on my face, toes poking through those pathetic shoes. 

‘It’s ok’ she said. ‘You were here the other day right? Maybe the drink isn’t the answer. My uncle fell on hard times too – lost his house, was on the streets too but he turned his life around. Once he put the drink down. There are places you can go you know – so you don’t have to be outside. On your own. Especially in this weather.’ She smiled. Pushed the 6 pack to side and pointed to the coffee machine instead. ‘Have one of those on me’.

Pity. All she sees is a bum. A drunk. 

Her uncle! Fuck her. 

Sunday. 1pm. 
I hate her. How dare she! 

11:30pm. Sunday. 
The door slides shut. The street lamp highlights her lumpy silhouette as she trudges down the sodden path. This is the last time I’ll watch her leave. I’ll move on. There will be someone out there for me. Someone that understands.

""Ugly."" *swipe left*

""Fat"" *swipe left*

...I guess she's alright. *swipe right*

""There's so many filters on this picture I can't even see her."" *swipe left*

I've been on tinder for about a week now, but I haven't matched with anyone willing to hook up with me yet. I've got about 6 matches and none of them have gone the way I hoped. Either the chick is uninterested, simply doesn't respond, or a just a plain freak. I was just about to give up when...

""Jennifer...Hmm.. this ones kinda cute."" It was a side profile of a girl looking off into the distance. A cute round nose, tan, eyes half closed. Her medium length hair tucked behind her ear. Her mouth left sultrily open. *expand profile* 

21, National Institute of Fashion Technology. I was slightly disappointed she didn't write a description but I've noticed its pretty common for girls around here. On the other hand,  she studies fashion and i couldn't figure out why that was a merit but it was. My finger swept across the screen slowly. My eyes moving from her eyes in the first photo to her eyes in the next. 

Her eyes were wide open and she was making a fish face. I pushed out some air from my nostrils as a slight smile slowly crept to my face. I did not expect such a contrast from her last picture.
""So she's not afraid to be a goof. Thats pretty awesome."" I noticed the filter she applied really made her cheekbones pop, but I'm sure that they'd be beautiful without one. I also couldn't help noticing that she has  some curves going on for her. I had to see what else she put up. 

Her next picture was a four panel photoshoot with her friend that practically every girl in the world has taken with her bff. The first panel she's just smiling. But damn, her smile, its so... pure. She gives off an aura of caring energy. In the next she's pouting, which normally looks so damn dumb but she pulls it off. In fact, its pretty hot. At this point I realized that I've already made up my mind about swiping right. I couldn't get enough though, I had to check her last picture and boy was I glad I made that decision!

It was a beautiful picture of a forest and her walking away. A keen eye captured the beauty of the wilderness certainly... but no one could deny the focus of that photo was that badonkadonk. The crazy thing was it looked like a candid photo, she clearly wasn't being a hoochie mama. 

*swipe right*

I spent the next few minutes looking at my profile. Updating my description, making sure the best pictures were chosen, made sure it was the best it could be.God damn I'm beautiful.
But honestly, it was mostly just frivolous nonsense in the end. I knew all i could do was hope. I spent the next 24 hours checking my tinder every 15 minutes. 

**Day 2**

*Congratulations! its a match!*

""Alright!"" I fist-pumped silently to celebrate my little victory. I knew that getting a match meant that she was at least a little interested, but I still had a long way to go. I opened up the chat window. 
I wrote something, but really it might as well have been nothing. 
...
...
I opened her profile again. 
...
...
I closed it. 
...
...
""I've spent too much time on this."" I decided to go with my standard ""Hey! :) what's up?"" I was pretty much betting on her having something interesting to say. I put it away. Then I put my phone away. (haha just kidding).I got a notification one minute later. That was quick?

""hey""
""just got a new puppy, busy watching everything he does haha""

Alright this is a good start I thought. She seems way more open than other girls already and it is interesting to me. I do love dogs. We talked for a bit about her new pug. I told her about how high maintenance my turtle is. It'll come across as funny and it'll show her that I think that animals are people too. Chicks dig that. Of course it worked. I AM the best after all. 

We have some light conversation, talk about which bars we frequent and what colleges we're going to. We had such a good conversation, I'm afraid of ruining it now. Plus it'll show her I'm not over eager. I should tell her I've got to go. Thats mysterious, chicks dig that right? No... what if she thinks I'm just not interested. Can't have that. Hmm... Okay I'll tell her I've got to babysit my niece. Yes! Thats it! That way she knows I'm a sensitive responsible person and not some creepy guy on tinder. 

""Got to babysit my niece""
""ttyl""

I waited for her response.

""Aww!""
""Alright, hope you hit me up soon ;)"" 

Damn. That could not have gone better. I smiled to myself. That night I laid in bed and fantasized about what she could be like for a long time. I didn't realize when i fell asleep because I dreamt about the same thing. 

**Day 3**

A girl like this, I'm sure she has a thousand matches. Alright, gotta think of a better way to say hello. Hmm...
""Hey! Remember me?""
I think she's smart enough to understand the obvious sarcasm 

""haha how could I forget you ? How's your turtle ;)?

Alright! She hasn't forgotten me. Maybe she isn't as unobtainable as I first thought... Anyways, I think its time to try a sexual joke. 

""Well, he could use a shell to crawl into ;)""
""Or did you mean my literal turtle? :P"" 

Haha! Sometimes I even crack myself up. I'm so fucking awesome.

Hours pass by. Crap, did i just fuck up? Man I'm such an idiot. Fuck. Maybe she just didn't see it? Should I send another message? Ugh. No. I don't know... Maybe I should apologize? I'm so dumb. I was just about to craft an apology when...

""hahaha good one!""
""My shell could use some company actually ;)""

I nearly jizzed myself. 

""haha sooooo you free tomorrow?""

A quick reply followed.

""for you... yeah ;)""
""Bring your turtle""

I took a cold shower. Don't judge me its been a while okay?!
As I lay in bed that night cold as fuck, I thought to myself. Why am I so obsessed with this girl? I just downloaded this lame app to hook up with easy bitches. Anyways, lets see how this goes.

**Day 4**

Hit the gym extra early in the morning. Gotta get that pump yo!As I thought this I suddenly realized, man I can be such a douche sometimes. Jumped into the shower, used my special conditioner, did some manscaping. Jumped out and got dressed. I looked myself in the eye in the mirror 
""You're the best around!"" I sang. I looked at my watch and realized i was running late. Crap.

I sprinted off to the bar we agreed to see each other. Its such a genius location. If she's catfishing me I can just have a beer and leave, if we get along well then the alcohol in her system is probably only going to make things more interesting. 

I saw her sitting there on the bar stool, beer mug in hand. Something about her, she just seemed so...alone and fragile and it made her seem so beautiful. My palms started to sweat. I didn't feel nervous until just now. Suddenly I was terrified, but my body couldn't stop moving towards her. Somewhere along my approach which seemed to be in slow motion from my perspective, our eyes met. The din of the entire pub seemed to slowly soften until I was within earshot. 

""Hey, Jennifer?"" I asked, but i knew.
""...Hi"" she said while I saw a smile slowly form on her face. Although she did seem slightly confused for a second. The whole thing was so surreal. It felt like neither of us broke our eye contact the whole conversation, not even blinking. 

**Day 5**

I woke up to a find myself alone and slightly hungover. My first thought was ""How fucking awesome am I?"" I looked beside me to look at my beautiful Jen, only to find myself confused. 

I was alone. 

I got up quietly, thinking she was just in the bathroom getting ready. I couldn't find a sign of her even being there. She was gone as easily as she came. I was dumbfounded. Isn't it usually the guy that leaves without saying a word? I went back to bed. Laid there for a while stared at the ceiling fan spin. Maybe I just wasn't good enough in bed for her? Crap. I knew I couldn't keep a girl like that... Idiot! What was I thinking?!

I looked on tinder and realized that she unmatched me. There was no way I could ever see her again...

No! I had to see her again! I went to her college campus. I would search every classroom if I had to. 

**Day 6**

I searched every way I could. I just couldn't find Jennifer. It was hopeless.

**Day 7**
 
*sigh* *swipe left*
*swipe left*
*swipe left*
*swipe left*
*swipe left*
*swipe left*
*swipe left*
No one could compare to Jennifer
*swipe left*
...Wait. What?...It was a side profile of a girl looking off into the distance. It was Jennifer. Only, on her profile it said her name was Jessica now. It was an identical profile otherwise. You better believe I swiped right so hard. I knew she wouldn't match with me though. I'm sure she's had enough.

*Congratulations! its a match!*

What is going on?! I had to figure this shit out. I was about to send a message when I get one from her...

""I'm sorry""
""I'm not who you think I am""
""Goodbye""
*unmatched*

I never saw her again. From strangers to strangers.  ______________________________________________________________________________________

[WP] A love story that starts and ends in 7 days. From strangers to strangers.,_aaargh,thanks.,puss_parkerswidow
[WP] A love story that starts and ends in 7 days. From strangers to strangers.,_aaargh,"Monday morning. I first saw him on the train and then again in the hotel lobby. He was tall, handsome in his business suit and maybe a little old for me. But there was still something there I found intriguing. I overheard him say he was going to be staying for a week. Sheena checked him in and gave him room 704, one of mine. I'd changed the sheets, cleaned the tub and toilet, and put out fresh soaps and shampoos just yesterday. 

He didn't notice me coming out of the back after I clocked in for my shift. Funny how people won't look at you or just don't notice you when you're pushing this huge cart full of cleaning supplies right in front of them. I saw him board the elevator, and hurried in to get a better look. He smelled really nice. Whatever it was, I am guessing a bottle of it costs more than I make in a week.

He exited the elevator on the seventh floor, and I watched until the doors closed, heading on up to floor nine to begin my work. He wouldn't need me to do anything in his suite until tomorrow, probably.

I smelled like bleach when I rode the train home. All I could think of was how nice he had smelled, and wouldn't it be great to smell like that after a hug from him, instead of like bleach after a day of cleaning toilets. I indulged myself in a romantic fantasy, daydreaming about meeting up with him in the hotel bar, dressed in something much more appealing than my uniform. No hair net. 

Tuesday around nine, he put the little plastic placard on the door knob, letting me know he was ready for a clean. I'd been past the room a couple of times already, eager to see what more I could learn about him, besides the fact that he was good looking, older, and smelled nice. He was gone when I went in. 

Brooks Brothers shirts pressed neatly, hung in a row in the closet. Pants and jackets each in their group; and one pair of jeans; one pair of sneakers; pajamas and underwear, t shirts- everything smelled like it was freshly laundered, but slightly carried a memory of him. There was a book on the table, and a single empty soda can.

There wasn't much to clean, but I lingered longer than I should have. For some reason, I looked around before I did this, but then I laid down in the bed, squeezing the pillow for a second and pretended it was him- that scent was all over it. I heard the electronic lock engage as a card slid in it, and I almost wet myself jumping out of the bed and positioning myself to appear as though I'd only been making it.

""Oh, hi there, I just came back to grab something, and I'll be out of your way,"" he said, picking up a small leather binder off of an end table. His smile was warm and his eyes were green. I'd never seen lashes like that on a man . He was even more handsome than I'd noticed before.

I couldn't speak, so I just smiled and nodded. He told me to have a wonderful day. I barely squeaked out ""OK, "" and out the door, he was gone. It was then that I noticed my reflection in the big mirror opposite the bed. Oh, shit! My hair was all over the place from having just moments before smushed my face into his pillow. I turned bright red, and thanked the gods no one could see me now. 

Fucking Charlotte. I was still red and blotchy when I exited the room, and there she was, coming out of the elevator. ""Jennifer, take a allergy pill or something, please, you look like shit. Did you get the rooms on floor nine yet?""  

""Yes, Charlotte. I've finished nine, eight, and seven. I'm heading down to six now."" Secretly, I wanted to kick her in the shins and run. In six months of working here, I've never been anything but efficient and fast. She knows that, but feels like she has to make herself look like she's motivating everyone.

All day Wednesday he had the do not disturb placard on the doorknob. I could hear people talking when I went by. Mostly men, but it sounded like at least one woman was in there, laughing. I went by a few times more than I should have, but I still got my work done on time.

Thursday was my day off, and I felt stupid for wanting to be there anyway. What kind of dummy wants to clean toilets just so they can look at some rich guy that's never going to give her a second thought? I walked the dog and we somehow ended up walking by the hotel. No sightings of the handsome Mr. Green Eyes.
Poor Chuy, his little legs were not meant to walk that far, so I carried him home. 

Friday, I went in early, so that Maggie could go to a parent-teacher thing, and I saw him at the breakfast buffet. There were two other well dressed men and a woman with dirty blond hair talking to them with lipstick smeared across her teeth. She was laughing and touched one of the men on his arm. Then she turned to Mr. Green eyes and said ""Remember the conference in Buffalo? When we were all snowed in and had to stay there an extra two days? Good God, I'm glad we're in Miami this year!""

I got my coffee and went to tell Maggie I was here and she could leave.

When I got to room 704, it was a bit more used than it had been the other day. There were dirty glasses and moisture rings on the table. His jeans were crumpled up and laying in the floor in front of the TV. I hung them in the closet, and began wiping everything down. I found an earring in the floor next to the bed, and set it on the dresser with a note. I wrote and tossed, and rewrote the note several times, finally settling on  ""Found this while cleaning, did not see it's mate,"" a smiley face, and my name, with the word housekeeping in parenthesis. Mr. green Eyes and Dirty Blond Lady were probably shagging. I finished cleaning the room, made the bed, without noticing any dirty blond hairs, and left.

Saturday, after my shift, I decided I would go out for a drink. It's against policy to drink in the hotel bar, so I changed in the staff bathroom, and headed to the place we all go- since I don't really know anybody that doesn't work with me. I sat down at the bar and talked to Mike the bartender, while he made me a Long Island Tea. No one else was there yet, it was kind of early, maybe sevenish. 

I was hungry, so I ordered some chili cheese fries, and right when they came, Mr. Green Eyes walked in. He was alone. The place was still mostly empty, and there he was- walking right towards me.

""Jennifer?"" The way he said it gave me goosebumps. Or maybe that was just a cool Atlantic breeze coming in from the open patio doors. I had on a simple blue dress with a low back, and the doors were right behind me.

I nodded my head, and said ""704, right?""

""That's right,"" he smiled. ""Thanks for putting Kim's earring on the dresser- she probably lost it along with her dignity, when she was drunkenly trying to get me to sit on the bed with her. 

""That must have been fun."" I raised my eyebrows involuntarily when I said that.

""Not really. I've worked with her for years, and she's married to a man I play golf with from time to time. I told her I was gay last year, thinking that might make her quit with the advances. No such luck.""

""Are you gay?"" I smiled.

""Yes. I'm gay. I'm getting married next August, to my boyfriend of twenty years.""

""Want some of my fries?"" That was all I could think of to say at the moment. Mr. Green Eyes was so out of my league, ha ha, but he was so nice, and smelled so good. He smiled and stuffed a chili cheese fry in his mouth.

We spent that whole night hanging out together. He bought me dinner, and we talked about Miami, dogs, music. Then we went dancing. He could salsa like a pro, and we had a lot of fun. We ended up walking on the beach at sunrise Sunday morning. He told me he was leaving in the afternoon, heading back home to San Diego, and his boyfriend. 

""Well, Mr. Green Eyes, that was the best night out I've had in Miami so far, and I would like to thank you for spending it with me."" I smiled and we walked back to the hotel. 

""Can I get a hug?"" He asked. His embrace was so comfortable, and I was enveloped in the warmth of his arms, and the scent of his cologne.

His name was actually Paul, and clearly, he was not the one for me. But I will always remember those eyes, and that wonderful scent.

From the day I laid eyes on the chocolate twisted chocolate chocolate, I knew that I was in love. I would get paid on friday, only three days away, and then we would be together at last. A match made in heaven.

Every day, I passed by the chocolate twist. I would get all light headed, and butterflies would flood my stomach. I could see myself holding and cherishing my new love. Friday came and it was mine! We had started off strangers, but now we were finally together! I made the tenacious relationship last; nibbling on it at different hours of the day.

Before I knew what had happened, it was over. Only a couple days of intense love and satisfaction; in the end, flushed down a toilet like none of it had ever taken place. I knew nothing could compare. No love could ever be as intense, and I would never - wait, they have a chocolate chocolate twisted chocolate chocolate?

Sonnet Number Twenty-Nine

Our love began like just another fling,  
And ended suddenly before I could see,  
But it felt like spending eons lost spring--  
No worries in the world could trouble me. 

I saw you at first through a drunken haze,  
And met you first, spilling a drink on your head.  
Was love at the very first awkward graze  
And burned like clumsy sex on a single bed.   
 
We spent the next week inseparable, through  
Our time meant to finish finals, spring break.  
But then the time ended and she withdrew,  
I moved on and forgot what I'd done that week.  

After we met, with other things, I learned  
A myriad of lessons, college is weird.

[WP] A love story that starts and ends in 7 days. From strangers to strangers.,_aaargh,"Takashi sat silently in the new Lexus, scanning the area for threats.

Yokari-san was generous to those who served him well, and the new car was to show his appreciation to Takashi for keeping his only daughter safe the last three years.

The neon sign flashed its signal to the night. Dance. As if Yuki needed to know how to dance.

Takashi had never met anyone so in tune with herself as Yuki. She always moved in rhythm, and her weekly dance lessons had only accentuated the effect on her sixteen-year old body.

He was Samurai. And that was enough. He needed to remind himself of that more often now that he was her primary bodyguard.

Yuki moved through the space around her like Takashi cut through the air with his eight cuts. Each angle carefully selected for maximum effect.

It had been three years since the first attack outside her school, and several months since the last attempt.

The last attack was still fresh on his mind. It kept him alert. And in pain, he thought, as he massaged his right hip absentmindedly. The two were not mutually exclusive.

The wound had not been as deep as it could have been. But it was deep.

Distracted by his thoughts, he didn't see the gray Mercedes pull up next to him until the last moment. Alarm bells rang out in Takashi's head as he realized he didn't recognize the car.

The windows were tinted with a mirror finish, and he tensed, half-expecting that this was the end. His end. That a torrent of gunfire would cut through him in the next moment.

In a way, that's what it felt like when she opened her door and he saw her for the first time. Like ... one life was over and another was starting.

She was beautiful in ways his mind couldn't quite fathom. Certainly in ways he had never considered. Her dark hair cascaded around her perfectly proportioned face to petite, yet strong shoulders accentuated by the stripes of her tracksuit. And her yoga pants fit perfectly, he noted as she moved towards the building.

He was Samurai. That meant he had a mission. She was new and needed to be investigated, he told himself as he exited the car and followed her inside.

Still, if the opportunity arose to introduce himself and learn her name ... well, no one would blame him for being thorough.

...

Seven days later. 

Takashi had been on three dates now with Akemi, the new dance teacher. Tonight would be the fourth. Her birthday.

He sat in the plush leather seat watching the craftsman make her birthday present.

She was seven days younger than him. Seven. Lucky. Just as he was for getting to know her.

The craftsman finished his work and blew on the thin metal to remove the last shavings, then placed it in a small brown envelope and handed it to him. ""242 yen,"" he said.

Takashi paid the man gladly. A bargain.

He was more relaxed than ... well, anytime that he could remember. Yuki was safe at home with no activities after a sick teacher had cancelled a music lesson, and Takashi had planned his rare, lucky evening alone carefully around his time with Akemi.

Takashi glanced at his watch. Late!

He drove too fast getting home, but traffic was light. 

Once inside, he set the package of candles onto the table and started dinner. His precious eight cuts didn't translate to the knife work in the kitchen, but his knives - like his blade - were kept razor sharp. He diced the vegetables and meats expertly.

Takashi had grown up in Yokari-san's household. His mother and father had died in a car accident when he was six.

Yokari had taken him in, but only as a place to learn and grow. So Yokari paid for Takashi to attend the best schools and to be trained by the best swordsman, but he was no father to Takashi.

That was right. He was Samurai and Samurai need a master. Not a father.

Since Takashi had more in common with the servants of the household, he had learned kitchen work early, and he took great pride in his culinary skills. It was from them that he had learned to keep his cookware hung and in good quality always. He glanced up at the stainless steel brightened to a mirror's sheen by careful polishing and a gentle smile crossed his lips. Everything must be perfect.

Once dinner was cooked and simmering, he set and lit the aromatic candles on the table and dimmed the lights of his three-room apartment. A fresh scent of citrus mixed with the salivating aroma of dinner.

A knock!

Takashi looked again at his apartment for anything out of place. It was sparsely furnished, but the furniture was of the highest quality. Takashi had good taste. Expensive, lasting taste. He saved his money and lived in frugality to afford it.

But no, everything was where it should be. He patted the pocket of his jeans to check for the gift and heard the rewarding crackle of the thin paper.

Glancing through the peephole, he saw Akemi. Akemi. Bright Beauty. And she was.
He opened the door and hugged her close. She laughed.

""Ohhh, everything smells so good, Takashi! I'm excited!""

""You smell better, Akemi. Come, come.""

And Takashi led her to her seat by the hand and poured them each a glass of wine.

She sat, eyes following him as he moved through the kitchen, checking each dish to make sure everything was the right temperature and texture.

Akemi watched him quietly, waiting. When his back was turned, she carefully removed the top of the tiny bottle she had hidden in her grasp and continued to watch Takashi carefully as she poured its liquid contents into his wine glass. Then, breathing a quiet sigh she didn't know she had been holding, she quickly replaced the cap and slipped it into the bra underneath her thin black dress.

Takashi returned with the soup and main dish and placed them on the table. He ladled out their soup, hers first and then his, and then sat at the seat closest to her. It was at an angle so they could see each other's face and yet still be in close proximity.

Even the few feet directly across from her was too far for Takashi's love.

The soup was excellent. They finished their bowls in silent appreciation, gazing into each other's eyes. She drank her wine, looking at Takashi expectantly. Hoping. Praying.

He grasped the glass with his left hand and raised it to his lips, his eyes full of love.

And then they changed as Takashi plunged the knife he had hidden in his pocket into her perfect chest and knocking her backwards off of her chair and to the ground.

""How?"" She asked as she began to die.

""I saw you in the reflection,"" he explained. ""Lucky, I guess. Who do you work for?""

She smiled sadly and shook her head. And then she died.

Takashi watched her in silence for a while. Making sure. 

Finally, he removed the gift from his pocket placed the key to his apartment on her chest, now reddened with blood.

Strangers to lovers to strangers. All in seven days.

[WP] A love story that starts and ends in 7 days. From strangers to strangers.,_aaargh,"The first day was magnificent.
I could see her everywhere I went.
In my coffee, in my shoes,
In the t.v while watching news.
She had me acting like a kid.
Though I didn't know her name.

On the second day, a slow approach.
I felt I had to make the most.
I looked at her and she at me.
We both saw the spark quite instantly.
I said, ""Hello, my name is Sid""
and thus I lit the flame.

Things were quickening by the third.
We both were fond of watching birds.
She played checkers, I played chess.
We played each other to see who's best
I fell hard. You bet I did.
When she beat me at my game.

Day four, our hearts kept up the pace.
Though we knew it was not a race.
Just being in her company,
was the best kind of fun for me.
Nothing about it was a quiz.
She was my kind of dame.

A question came up upon the fifth.
I asked exactly where she lived.
And the answer so perfect you can ignore
her room was down one floor!
Hopeless romance, I'm in bliss.
Love the culprit to blame.

6 days have passed and still I see.
The reasons why it's meant to be.
Gracefully across the common room
she is dancing with a broom!
Truly a small world this is.
We both wound up insane.

A week has now come and gone.
I ask the nurse if she's seen my blonde.
I find her and a blank stare in her eyes.
I see, my face, she doesn't recognize.
Just one day of meds she missed.
now I swallow the pain.

[WP] It's discovered that the human race is the oldest intelligent species in the universe.,cff0055,"""What are you?"" blurbled Gluarik.

The creature sat before him seemed at ease but old, so very old, so old that the word ancient felt young and barely able to crawl in comparison.  To use the word old as a descriptor here was to be a failure.

The creature did something not terribly pleasant with its face.  It made Gluarik queasy.  Whatever eon this creature had come from, it had not been a pretty one.  In fact, it was almost a Lose Your Lunch moment.  This thing was not something it would be safe to broadcast amongst Gluarik's people.

The thing opened its mouth and sound came out.  Gluarik's machinery took in the sounds, the harsh, guttural sounds were not pleasant.  No auditory broadcasts either for this species.  This was going to be a purely academic paper then.  The popularizers would be sorely disappointed.  

The Great Mystery of the Mote of the Galactic Eye SOLVED!  But no one would be able to hold their meals in to watch the event.  Gluarik's stomachs heaved.

The alien did something equally disturbing with its face.  It cocked its head to one side.  No telling what it was doing.  Gluarik might be a xenologist, but this was an unprecedented race.  Nothing like it existed out in the galaxy.  

The long strands, silvery white in the light, fell to one side.  It looked like fungus had sprouted from a rotten fruit.  Gluarik was really glad he'd not eaten before entering the Mote.

And the smell.  Gluarik closed its orbs for a moment.  It cleared its olfactory organs and opened its orbs once more.

The machines gave blank answers as for what the creature had said, but Gluarik was startled.  The creature had done something.  Gluarik could not tell what, but something had changed while he had closed his eyes.

It spoke again and this time caused Gluarik to almost jump out its sheemth.

""Do you understand me now?"" it said.

Gluarik was stunned.  How?  How could it speak Glark!

""Stop fretting over how.  I am old and know a few tricks.  And, yes, I am reading your mind.  Though not through some mystical silliness.  It merely took me a moment to calibrate and understand.  You're an interesting species. The first to have come here and entered the megastructure.  Successfully, at least.  We have been waiting for close to a billion years, if we didn't miss a zero in our calculations.""

Again, something unpleasant with its face.  With one of its orbs.

""Waiting and waiting at the edge of the maw of the galactic center's blackhole.  Time slowed to a crawl.  Even so, entropy wins all wars.  Even against immortals such as we.  We are few and most are asleep.  I am the Guardian and Watcher.  I am hear to greet you.  Or something like you.""

Gluarik was stunned.  It was articulate, if disgusting.  His chromatophores began to dance a display and he tried to stop, but could not.  ""What are you, old one?""

""I suppose I ought to have known that would be the first real question.  I am a human.  And Humans were the First Ones.  Now, come, let us wake the others and we will see if the seeds we sewed so long again have sprouted and grown strong.""

[WP] A serial killer of Reddit trolls.,elsol69,"""Fucking weakling"" whispered Joe to no one in particular. He typed ""I've been in the same situation for six years now. Just do it, man. Believe me, it would never get better."" He hit save, and smiled. Sheep. It was their fault for being so trustful. He glanced at his Saitama figure — sometimes he wished he could just one-punch people over internet.

""As a black man"", he wrote in another comment, ""I agree with you completely. People who do that are scum and deserve no respect.""

Joe glanced through a few more pages before he saw a post that got his attention. He swore loudly. After a few PMs, he picked the headphones and called. ""Hello. Yes. Yes. I want to report an emergency. 35 Sunflower Ave. I'm a neighbor. I believe there are intruders in that house. Yes. Tall, all in black. Armed. Yes. My name is William. Thank you!"". He didn't do it often, of course, but this was a special case.

He wasn't worried about his parents overhearing him — it was past midnight, and so they were asleep. He was often up until late, and they stopped bothering him about it a long time ago.

There was a new PM, and just as he was going to open it, the PC suddenly shut down. ""Not again"" muttered Joe. Damn fuse. His father promised to fix it, but in the meantime Joe just needed to go outside and reset the fuse manually.

Outside it was very dark — seems all the fuses turned off this time, and the street light didn't quite reach the back of his house. The wind played in the branches. He heard something moving, and almost jumped — but it was just a cat.

He cursed himself for not taking a flashlight, or a phone. But he thought he remembered the box well enough, and he was sure he would be able to switch the fuses on touch. So he reached the box in darkness, and opened it.

There was a second while Joe had no clue what he was looking at, but then he realized — someone had used a glowing paint to draw a large smiley face inside his fusebox. ""What the fuck!""

There was a soft rustle behind him, and this time it wasn't a cat.

And then — silence, and only the wind in the branches.",pixeltalker

"[WP] You were the first superhero and were hounded by the press and public into hiding. Years later, more supers appeared but learning from happened to you they all chose to be villains. The world now calls for your return.",elsol69,"I still remember years ago, when they were calling for my arrest. They didn't appreciate my help for very long after I started. They quickly decided that the “v” in V-Man stood for vigilante. Every day since, a part of me has wanted to be upset about that; trouble is, it's true. I knew what I was doing, going outside the law. But at the time, I felt it was warranted and I knew I wasn't the only one. Those same papers were demanding change, sometimes revolution. In some ways, they created V-Man.

These things they're saying now, they're all too reminiscent of then, when they were crying for help on behalf of the city. And they're right to do so, things are really bad. But I've been through this. I know what comes later and it's hardly motivating. Sitting here, I question if that has any bearing. The city is in trouble. But I have to decide what's most important. There's the immediate good, the greater good, the best end result, and hey, there's also what's best for me. Sure seems easy when you read it in a book or see it in a movie, but reality is nothing like that.

I know at least one thing for sure – it would go a long way if the press would stop blaming me for what these supervillains or doing and their existence. Sure, I was the first “super”, but I never did anything villainous. Even the press would have to give me that. Either way, I don't see how I have anything to do with it. These guys made their choices just like I made mine. Difference is, my motives weren't selfish. Look where that got me.

I've had a lot of time to think since the city asked for V-Man to “vanish”. I think that was their nice way of acknowledging that while they wanted to exile V-Man, they understand that there's a real person behind the mask. Maybe I should have left anyway. It's not as if this city has been any sort of kind to my real identity. But as I thought, I remembered why I started. This is my city, I wanted to help it, and I'd found a way to do that. That's also the thought that keeps circling back to me now, as every sort of broadcast routinely requests my return. Curious that they're all so polite now.

I have yet to decide what to do. I think it's clear that the city needs help with these super-thugs. But I know all too well what's going to happen, at minimum, to V-Man afterward if he returns. Is it my responsibility to bear that burden? I wonder what these talking heads and radio voices would choose if they were in my position. Actually, no need. I know them all by this point, too well, after all their slander of V-Man and his deeds. None of them would choose to help, at least not strangers.

I've sat wondering for too long what I should do. It's time to choose. I almost admit to myself that there really never was a decision to make. Once I'd learned these were supervillains in my city and not just typical criminals, I knew this was a likely situation. I did wait to see if the police had an answer for their plans and abilities. They did well at first, but then things escalated; it seemed as if the supervillains had been holding back, teasing the police force and toying with the city. Now as I watch the live news feed of one of them, I see that they've only just begun. Things are still escalating. Perhaps there was never a decision to make, but if there was, they just made it for me. I hope my V-Man disguise still fits.",Bryan_FM

"[WP] A happy... no, a JOYOUS superhero origin story. (Or supervillain if that's your thing).",elsol69,"This was the day that would change Jake's life. He had a pleasant upbringing. No tragic accidents, no one had caused him any harm. Jake was just a normal 19 year old, living out his day to day life. That was the problem for Jake. He grew up reading stories of his favorite superheros. Jake was a bit jealous of their adventures, and their ability to help those in need. To make a difference. That was what Jake yearned for, more then anything else. 

For Jake, life was dull. Too dull. He did not mind it. He had his family, his friends, and a purpose to learn everything he could so that he could make a living on his own.

Jake took an interest in martial arts. All the sparring sessions he had with his friends were one of the happiest moments of his life. But it was just a hobby. 

On this day Jake was in the city, visiting a friend. ""Damn"", he thought, as Jake wondered around, confused about where he was. He was lost. Taking out his phone, Jake realized that it was dead. No using GPS. Jake tried to backtrack his way back to somewhere familiar. It was getting dark. Jake, wasn't as much as afraid, as concerned. He didn't know the area, and he had heard that some streets were dangerous at night. 

It was then when he heard something. A half scream for help, before it was stifled by something. Did he imagine it? Jake felt anxiousness rise in his chest. No, he hadn't imagined it. Where did it come from? In that alley? It must have been. Jake headed over in that direction, cautious in his step now.

A moment later, he saw what was going on. A boy about his age was being ganged up upon by four men. One was holding the helpless boy, covering his mouth, while the others took turns wailing into him. The group were chuckling to themselves, no doubt taking pleasure in harassing their victim. ""I have to stop them."" Jake told himself. But there were four of them, and only one of him.

His thoughts changed when he saw one man take out a knife. Were they going to kill him? Jake couldn't discount the chance that they would. Jake's character prevented him from shying away. He simply could not sit still while a murder happened before his eyes. He did not even consider his own personal safety in the matter. So, Jake charged in, thinking that he could at least get the group away from the boy long enough for him to escape.

He managed to take one of the number totally by surprise. Jake was lucky. None of them had been looking his way. Reaching the man closest to him. Jake grabbed the man from behind and threw him back over Jake's leg. Landing to the ground, the man was helpless to defend himself from Jake's second attack. Jake's foot slammed into his face, probably breaking the man's nose, and dazing him badly.

Turning toward the rest, Jake realized that they were facing him now. He screwed up. Jake did not consider the possibility that they would have more weapons. Time seemed to freeze as he noticed the gun and two knives coming up to attack him. Jake's heart was beating fast. It was an odd sensation. Time was still so slow. Still... so.. slow... Everything was moving at a snail's pace now. It took a moment to notice, but Jake was able to move slightly faster then the people around him. 

""Wait, what?"" Jake thought, confused. Jake didn't know what was happening, but there were three armed bad guys in front of him. Jake moved, he calculated that he would be able to run under the two knives and reach the man armed with the gun first. Proving to be correct, he grabbed and twisted the gun, just noticing that the man had been able to pull the trigger. 

The bullet was also slow. Though, it was relatively much faster then the three assailants. Jake had time to get out of the way from the traveling bullet. Luckily, the trajectory didn't lead the bullet near anyone. Jake saw that in shifting left to avoid the bullet, and twisting the gun, he was in position to sweep the leg of a knife wielding thug. He did just that. In a few moments, he was ready to clock the guy who now had nothing in his hand. The third guy was easy as well. Coming in way after finishing the other two, Jake avoided the knife, and performed an uppercut to the man's chin.

The action took mere seconds in real time. But for Jake, the moment seemed like it took 10 minutes. Everything returned to normal for Jake when all four assailant were disarmed. The four men got up and stumbled away, cursing under their breath. Jake's heart was beating normally now. He felt... Amazing! This was exhilaration he longed for! This was what his dull life lacked! He had a special gift, Jake realized, just like the superheros he had read about. It was all too unreal, as if this was all a dream and that he would wake up soon. But it wasn't a dream, and he was happy. Jake finally felt his life had real purpose now. Not just going through the motions, but able to make real difference by taking on the bad things in this city.

Jake shook the moment of bliss aside for a moment. Oh right, the guy that was being beaten up. Jake lifted the wide-eyed victim. ""Thank you... So much."" The boy said. ""Not a problem,"" Jake beamed, as he patted his first saved citizen.

This was only the first. Jake became known as ""The Acrobat"" vigilante by media and local police. And Jake's set of skills would only grow further.",GreyWolf035

"[WP] ""I'm so tired.""......This is the first sentence.",erinkmo,"I'm so tired. Even the loud roar of the engine isn't keeping me awake.  Fatigue has kicked in. My eyes doze outside the open air cabin. I look in the black abyss of the night and all I can think is, I’m so tired. I tuck my hands behind the shoulder straps of my vest and slowly start to lower my head. The constant vibration from the helicopters rotors act like an strangely satisfying yet soothing lullaby for my aching body. I fight to stay awake. I barely made it into the helicopter after a 72 hour patrol. Eight of which were spent sleeping, with one eye open. 

 I'm promptly awoken by the Sargent pressing on my chest, like he's giving CPR compression on a lifeless victim. 

""What the fuck?!""
 I say, in a scared buy equally infuriating tone, pushing him away from me. 
""What?""
 He says, laughing sharply while looking around at the guys in the platoon, ""I was just following the directions"" 

I look down at my bright blue vest that has the word ""PRESS"" imprinted on it. Journalists in combat areas are required to wear this hideous vest to identify us as reporters. It's bullshit if you ask me. Not that I’m complaining about wearing a bullet proof vest, but ISIS doesn't care who I am or who I work for. If you hang out with the guys with tanks and big guns, you're a target. In my case, a bright blue target. 

I jab back, ""Shouldn't you be strapped in Sargent?"" with a snarling tone. He pauses and lifts his eyebrow, ""Boy, you know how many times I've had to save your pencil pushing ass?” slowly getting back to his seat. He stares at me like an unwanted orphaned puppy. While plopping into his bucket seat he exhales, ""I should have let you walk in that cross fire this morning"" he mumbles while looking away. He snaps his head back at me and points, ""You put my whole platoon at risk you know that?!""

Still fumbling with his strap, he finds the first buckle. Cursing my name under his breath. While securing the second strap, the helicopter takes a steep climb. The G-force pushes everyone’s heads into their chest. The Sargent, fighting the downward force, tries to fasten his strap as we forcefully ascend. 

The helicopter starts to stall and everyone in the cabin is weightless for a brief second. Now, time seems as if it’s standing still. I am sure it’s all over. We start to freefall, and the Sargent is still battling his straps. An explosion from the tail end of the copter sends us into a wicked spin. I try to brace myself for what will be a sure fatal crash. The flames blind me as we make contact with the ground.

I open my eyes and see dirt. My face is covered in what feels like grainy mud. I turn on my side and over to my back. In sock, I just lie there and look up at the night sky. My ears ringing with a swan song. Then, like someone turn on the volume to full blast, all at once I hear everything. The fuel form the helicopter burning, shot being fired in distance, fuzzy chatter on the radio of a dead marine next to me. I wipe the wet dirt off my face and realize its blood. I frantically check my head and don’t feel any lacerations.  

As I look around I see one survivor, our medic. He’s on his knees frantically working on someone. Still in shock, I hobble over to him tripping over twisted metal and body parts.  

He yells, “Sarge, are you with me!?” 

I get closer. He’s doing chest compressions on the Sargent. He turns his head for a quick glance toward me, “Are you going to watch or fucking help me?!” 

I drop to my knees next to him and he says “See what I’m doing?” taking in a deep breath out of exhaustion “How my hands are interlocked on his chest?” “I need you do it exactly how I am or he’ll die” 

Without any words I compile and take over compressions. The medic stands up and starts searching for something among the wreckage. He yells back without looking at me “We need a radio, who ever hit us is closing in quick”

While repeatedly pushing down on his chest, I start to feel my muscles burn. I’m so tired.

He stuck his neck out and took a few careful sniffs of the air in my space, licked his nose and walked backwards in that weird way that dogs do. He remembered me, but it was from the Christmas party a few years back and not as his owner’s secret roommate.

Amy had a right to be scared: from her perspective one of her former students had snuck into her house, somehow, and was casually walking down the stairs as if it were something he did every day. She kept her white knuckle grip on the kitchen knife, sniffling from the half-diced onion on the counter. She had been making breakfast for one.

“I’m not going to hurt you. I need to check something, though.” I made slow, deliberate movements, raising my hands where Amy could see them, and took off the watch I *always* wore. Yesterday-Amy would have been shocked to see it off my wrist, as if I had gone naked in the middle of a church. 

The inside of the band was glowing green; it had been coated with a reactive material. “Judging by how bright this is—” even with the sunlight coming through the big window, I didn’t have to cup my hands around it to see it glow “—I’d say I shifted in the past two hours or so.”

The scientist in Amy asserted herself. “That’s exactly the same color as the indicators we have in the lab.”

“Alexeyev—”
“—ev radiation”, we finished the phrase together.

“It worked,” she said, “but it didn’t work, did it?”

“That’s the short version, Dr. Linares.” I put the watch back on.

“I’ve got a thousand questions: momentum compensation, matter-matter interface interactions … but you are? Were? Whatever. Only an undergrad assistant.” Her face betrayed a little disappointment that the most junior worker in her lab and the least knowledgeable had been the one to slip into the multiverse.

“Believe me, I’ve learned a lot, the hard way. I *am* your assistant still, kind of. This worldline’s version of me *was* your assistant, hopefully he graduated.”

“Three years ago. Now there’s two of you here,” she realized.

“Right. Is the Project still running on this worldline?”

“Of course. But we’ve never been able to move past the atomic level. You’re proof that we can scale up—”

“—no. I’m proof that you need to shut the Project down. Immediately.”",wpforme
"[WP] You awake and start getting ready from work, you go downstairs and no one in your house knows who you are and your pictures have vanished.",hosey93,"The first thing that went wrong was when my staircase ended a full three feet *above* the floor. Worse still, I could see *right through* where they used to be. The whole staircase was floating above the floor. The bottom was G-O-N-E gone. I stopped, mind unable to comprehend such a stupid thing - when I saw my boy Fred walking in the kitchen ahead of me. 

""Hey, Fred,"" I cried out. 

The boy stopped. Then he went on with his work like I didn't exist.

Now this was decidedly annoying. I could've sworn I fixed those steps the other day. I jumped down, socked feet making not a sound. The keys were on the counter. Underneath them was a yellowed ticket stub I didn't remember purchasing. I put them both into my pocket before I walked into the kitchen.

""Hey guys, what's wrong with-""

I stopped. Everyone stared at me, slack-jawed, before Mary stepped in front of my kids and eyed me with two icy blue daggers.

""What are you doing in my house?"" she said.

I was dumbstruck. ""Ma-Mary?"" I said. ""What - what's going on?""

The ice stiffened even more.

""How do you know my name?""

I took one step to the side. ""It's me, Jim!"" I said. ""Don't you recognise me?""

Seeing silence, I tried something else. 

I held up both my hands. ""I know all of your names! Look, there's Fred, and the other one's George. They're *our* kids, Mary!""

Mary took one step forward. I tried to duck, but it was no use. She swung, and her fist smacked me right across the jaw. I pulled back instantly, my face throbbing, and her blue eyes nearly full with tears.

""Get out,"" she whispered, her hair bouncing up and down. ""Get out.""

I was glued to the spot. ""What?""

""GET OUT!"" she screeched. ""GET OUT, STALKER! JIM'S BEEN DEAD FOR OVER FOUR YEARS AND YOU KNOW IT!""

I only had time to run back out, where the picture of our wedding day lay untaken, before Mary chased me out of my own front door.

---

*Just what the hell was going on?*

Our pictures were missing. My wife didn't recognise me. My kids thought I was the criminal on the seven o'clock news. And worst of all they had said I was dead! My mind reeled as I pulled out my keys and got into the car. Fred's soft toy was in the front seat. It was his Winnie the Pooh - I had given it to him as a fifth birthday present. I tossed it into the back seat and belted myself in. But I couldn't drive; my mind was too much on my kids and what was going on. I couldn't be dead. There had to be some mistake I could sort out. So I got back out.

Could I even legally drive?

I opened my wallet, and picked out my drivers' license. The only problem was, the card was blank. No name, no address, no photo - almost as if I had been erased from existence, almost as if I had come unstuck in time. There was no record of me even having existed, aside from-

In a flash I saw my only chance.

*Maybe I wasn't alive now, or even existed now. But Mary said I had been dead for more than four years. Which means that I had once been alive, up until a certain date four years ago.*

Four years ago...

I pulled out the ticket stub, and my eyes bulged. 

It was half of a ticket for the night of August 31st 2011. The journey had taken me from Collingwood to Flinders Street. From there, I could've gone virtually anywhere - everything met up at Flinders Street. Trains, of course, but also buses, trams in two different directions, even on to the intercity links, maybe to the airport.

Where had I gone that night? 

I opened the gate, starting to walk out, before something else struck me as weird.

I didn't usually take the train. My car could get me anywhere. Why had I chosen to take the train that night? Was I too incapacitated to drive? Or did I *expect* to be too drunk?

My feet had pointed me towards Collingwood train station. *Here we go,* I thought. *Retracing a journey made four years ago guided by a single scrap of paper.*

What else had happened to me that night?

---

The woman behind the station counter was nice enough when I told her I wanted a one-way ticket. *August 31st, 2011.* What had I done that night? I went downstairs. As soon as I got onto the platform, I could see a train approaching in the distance. The gods must have smiled upon me. I saw the crowd expectantly move forward, clumping up behind the yellow line. And then I saw something else.

At the base of one pillar, hidden away in a recess, was the black-and-white of-

*A magnetic chessboard?*

The train pulled into the station.

I had a magnetic chessboard once. The people around me were starting to move. If I went for it I might miss the train. Could I catch another one?

As the doors opened, I turned back, ran over to where the chessboard was stuck in the pillar, and prised it out. The platform was empty. The train looked ready to move on. I sprinted. The doors started to close-

One or two bewildered faces moved aside as I hurtled down the platform. I came through, stepping on the train, and squeezed on just as the doors closed. I looked at the chess set in my hand as the carriage lurched forward. When I opened it, I instantly knew I was right - the second clue in the journey. The gods must have decided it was fun to play games after all.

Inside the board, instead of magnetic chessmen, there was a single locker key. I had no box yet, but attached to the key was a number: 427. *Locker 427 at Flinders Street.* I didn't remember it at all. But it must obviously be important. Who knew all this? Who had set up the clues to tell me a secret about my undead self?

The train moved on. Holding on to a pole, I afforded myself a small breather. I was on my way. There was some logic to the madness. Then I looked at my reflection in the glass, and I nearly screamed out loud.

The person looking back at me was a complete stranger.

[WP] What happens at the end?,jas0850,"""So what happens at the end?""

I laughed as the young boy on my knee begged for another chapter. He still hadn't figured out that the same book every night didn't magically rewrite itself. This might become a problem in time, for one could only make up so many stories in a row, but for now it seemed that limit was not yet reached.

""The end you say?"" 

I asked, smiling calmly. Carefully, I lifted the boy from my knee, setting him down upon the bed of cloth and feathers, smoothing his hair with a steady hand. 

""Why do you want to know about the end?""

""Well I want to know what happens! What happens to that brave knight after he had slain the dragon?"" His smile was tired, but that grin seemed to glow in the dim light of the room. ""I want to know.""

His voice was exhausted, as I lifted the blankets of wool, pulling them slowly over top his tiny frame.

""Well,"" I said brightly, as I tucked the boy beneath his covers. ""He and his lovely princess lived happily ever after, of course.""

""Really?""

""Yes, really."" I blew out the final candles, and rose- away from the bed.

Even in the torches light from the hall, I could see the smile that settled on his face was a happy one. I heard his breathing steady- sleep already fast approaching. It was only moments later that I had closed the door, all but a crack, and quietly walked down the hall of stone. All within keep this evening, were now still, and the silence held beyond the steps of my shoes upon the floor.

The study was still lit, candles still burning in the small room as I opened and shut the heavy door of wood with a quiet grace, and poured a glass of wine from the bottle waiting at the table. Though I knew better, I gave a glance towards the chest, tucked away beneath a desk of scrolls and parchment.

*""Happily ever after...""* 

The feeling in my throat as the red liquid passed my lips barely dissipated at all.

In silence, I sat watching the flame of a single waxed wick flicker through the stained glass of its case, waiting. It danced and whispered to me through the colored clarity of green and red, pushing at my thoughts. I set the empty glass in my hand down, and uncorked the bottle yet again, doing away with the cup entirely as the memories surfaced, and I failed to stop them.

*""Rodrick! Go- take my sword!"" Her voice echoed in the hall, her breath ragged.*

*""Take it! Finish this!"" The blood was dripping down her side, as I tried to touch her face, one last time- her white cross upon the breastplate, all but covered now. ""The is no time. Go, now!"" Her voice was twisted in pain.*

*Eyes like works of art, deep green and determined- she did not hesitate to press it into my unwilling hands, before I left her there. With that blade, I ran towards death.*

Slowly, I leaned back in my chair as I set the empty bottle down with unsteady hands, to push my seat slowly away from the desk. Tired arms reaching for the chest. 

It groaned as if in agony, against the stone floor. Its resistance was not enough.

*The beast reared upon its legs, screeching fire and death- setting the castle ablaze as if a kiln. My shield all but melted to slag- even as I threw it aside, picking up another from a fallen soul- rushing towards the wound upon its side. I saw the gash of red beneath its scales of blackened gemstones.*

The chest slowly opened, and I pushed aside the cloth that filled it, pressing the carefully folded garments without grace. Ignoring the stains that fell upon them from above, my hand felt it beneath the layers, cold as it had always been.

*As swift as the beast was, the blade struck- deep and true, and the creature screamed in agony as my arm pulled and twisted! I saw its neck- serpentine and fluid, speeding towards me as I swung with all my might, cleaving through the-""*

Beneath the cloth, I let my hand curl around the cold grip, feeling the metal of the crossed guard touch my fingers with the barest hints of chilled steel. In the distance I could hear the sound of battle, if only in my mind.

*As the beast fell and I screamed of victory, I turned to face my comrades only to find only bodies. Empty vessels, long lost of soul- eyes closed, with looks of pride still upon their faces. Those great white crosses upon their armor covered in ash and blood, with no hands to raise in the honor but my own. Not even hers.*

*In that room, for all our sacrifice- for all their honor, there was only silence.*

My hand trembled, as the bottle fell- shattering upon the floor of the stone room in a hundred shards of jagged glass. A hiss rang along the metal and the sheath as I pulled the blade free, still shining as brightly as I remember- however stained it had become with the passing ages. Those tendrils of weaving metals, tinted with blood that never had washed out.

The reflection which stared back at me on that polished surface was of a different man then I remembered.

Before me, the candle began to sputter and wane in the dying light, barely keeping to the dim glow that still held in the room as I set the weapon back. The sheath and edge finding their way down into the chest, before once again being pushed back against the wall beneath the desk.

How many years had it been now?

On unsteady legs, I rose, staring at the flame as the tears fell. An endless stream of quiet drips upon the floor, silently sinking into the stone below, as the light went out.

Did it matter?

*For in the end, they lived happily ever after.*

“Ha!” snuffled Tarquin. “Was! Your father and mother may have been working class, but you, my boy, no…” he sipped on his Amontillado sherry…”no, you were not brought up in Peru, ‘in the jungle with your hunter mother and father’ were you? You were brought up here in Blighty…right here in London!”

Paddington glared at him. He hated how his friend held his arrogant head high in the air, sniffing at his glass of sherry as if he knew everything. 

“What’s that got to do with anything? I’m from working class stock, therefore I am working class…quad et demonstrandum!”

She had been sitting out his particular discussion but feared that it was getting a little too heated for a reasonable after dinner discussion. “Guys, I think we are getting a little…” but that was all she managed to get in before Tarquin shot forward in his seat.

“Quad et demonstrandum…actually its ‘quod erat demonstrandum’…but nonetheless, ‘I say chaps, Q.E.D!’ he laughed. mockingly “The typical turn of phrase down the ol’ Sheppard’s Arms of a Friday night, eh?

I can see it now:


	‘Oi me ‘ol matie….Is them’s new Nikes you are wearing Chantal?

	Cor blimey no, Brittaney, they’re Adidas.

	Pray how can you tell mi ol’ apple &amp; pears?

	Because of the three stripes what are on the side,

	Ok, quad et demonstrandum chum,  Let’s get another alcopop eh! “

Taquin tailed off in a fit of laughter.

“For god’s sake Tarqui” interrupted Emily angrily, “There is no need to be derogatory!”

Paddington was himself holding back a snigger but didn’t want Emily to see. To be fair, it was more at Tarqui’s ridiculous idea of the working classes that at the crass joke he was trying to make. After all, apple and pears is rhyming slang for ""cares""…not something you call your friends!! Pah.

“Listen Tarquin Aloysius Harrington-Montague….”

“ooooooo!” interrupted Taruiqn again, flicking a finger off his nose and into the air, mocking Paddington’s attempt at shaming his aristocratic roots.

“I said listen….” Paddington continued, “Your upper class swipe at my working class brethren aside, you cannot deny that I am ostensibly working class. I was born in the open in the jungle in Peru to two ‘salt-of-the-earth’ parents...I am simply not middle class. I may however….”

“Please!” shouted Tarqui, rising from his seat and stretching his broad frame to its full six-feet-and-two-inches of height. It has to be said that he cut an impressive figure, captain of the rugby team at Edinburgh with the disfigured nose of a thousand scrums to prove it! Paddington, on the other hand, average, at best, even for a jungle pigmy stared ever upwards at his rampant friend.

“You are as middle class as Quinoa!”

“Which is from Peru” smiled Paddington smugly!

“Ok then…as middle class as alfalfa sprouts!”

“I don’t even know what they are” scoffed Paddington

“Nooooboooody knows what they are, that’s the point of them. You just can’t buy them in Asda!”, cried Tarqui slowly to emphasise his point. “But you know where to buy them though! You know exactly on which aisle in Waitrose a chap can find them, no?”

Emily, who had been feeling increasingly uncomfortable about the tone of this discussion stood up, “Now boys, this is getting out of hand, please calm down! Why don’t we…”

“I will do no such thing”, said ‘Paddington “Paddy” Brown’ – fighting the corner of the working man. He rose off his ottoman, stood on the tips of his clws and looked up into Tarquin’s increasingly drunken eyes. “You sir are an arrogant, conceited Aristocrat…and like all of your kind you seek to oppress us common folk”

“Common folk” laughed Tarquin interrupting again…”Just where do you live?”   

“You know where I live”

“Exactly, 33 Harrow Road!”

“And…?”

“How many ‘working class, salt-of-the-earth, cor blimy mate, folk’ live between Media Vale and Notting Hill, eh?”

“That doesn’t mean anything, I was just brought up there”

“My point exactly, where do you shop?”

“Well, in Waitrose but I have been known to go to Sainsbury’s”

“Haha! And what’s your favourite wine?”

“Rioja” snapped Paddington with a claw in the air, “What do you say about that, Lord Snootington! A very common wine indeed…in fact, I have even seen it in Lidel!” Paddington put a heavy emphasis on the word seen. He was proud of the fact the he went to a Lidel once and often mentioned it at dinner parties. Albeit he was only there to ask for directions to the closest Mark’s and Spencer’s…however, no the less, he had been in and had seen, with his own eyes, a bottle of Rioja!

Tarquin smiled and leaned forward, grabbing one of Paddington’s furry cheeks between his thumb and forefinger, “The very fact that you answered, Rioja, and not simply ‘Red, matie’, my hirsute little friend, belies your incontestable middle class nes…nes…nes!” Apparently the sherry was grabbing hold of Tarqui’s tongue in a more forceful manner than he expected…and perhaps the two bottles of Chilean Merlot they had at dinner, and the Cognac after… 

It was boiling Paddingtons blood as well, something Tarqui would have seen had Paddington’s thick fur coat not been hiding it.

“What’s more” Tarqui added” I happen to know that you are a Guardian reader. What more proof do I need, your honour?” he smirked, looking again at Emily as if she was the arbiter of all drunken discussions. Emily just stared at the swirling golden liquid in her glass of Tokaij, not wanting to take any side in the matter. After all, that simply wouldn’t be polite.

“…and what’s more” he added, in his smug, arrogant tone, “I happen to know that you have always read the Guardian, every since you were a little, hairy, marmalade eating cub. Judy told me that you even called it the ‘Teddy Bear Guardian’ ”

Paddington was furious! Why did he have to bring Judy into this, the arrogant twat. His blood boiled, he eyebrows twitched, his nostrils flared, his claws dug into the flesh on his own leg - tearing through the trouser pocket of his navy Tommy Hilfiger slacks. Perhaps it was that second after-dinner Scotch finally catching up with him, perhaps it was that fact that he had lost control of the seething jealousy he had hidden for so many years, perhaps it was the mention of Judy after all this time…whatever it was, something snapped deep inside Paddington. He was alive, raw and savage. All at once the power of the jungle had awakened in him and he remembered he was a bear…and so, as a bear he mauled his middle class friends, shouting…”How D’ya Like This For Fucking Working Class Matie!” and “ILL GIVE YOU FUCKING TEDDY BEAR GUARDIAN!”

The next day Paddy Paddington Brown, the working class hero of Portabello Road Market had a particularly nasty hangover. Not only was he feeling the effects of too much Scotch the night before, as he sat on the throne in the bathroom, he found it was a lot harder than he had expected to say goodbye to his old friend. In fact, it was quite a strain!

[IP] Teddy Bear Guardian,Alekosen,"Tickle kept watch with her eyes open.  Mostly because she couldn't close them, but also because her mission was so very, very important.  The Animosities were after this child with a vigor seldom seen in their kind.  The ProTeddorate was still trying to sort out why, and until a complete response was decided, her mission was to keep the vaporious creatures from taking this one.  
The boy knew nothing of course. He had found one of the few houses still sealed against the intrusions of the Animosity's agents.  There was no one else to look after him. There were so few humans left.  Unseen to the boy, the ProTeddorate worked in a vast circle around him, protecting, guiding him to ""random"" caches of food, clothing, whatever he needed.  But he had found this house when the teddies hadn't even considered anything other than massive collections of teddies waging war with the vapors while he slept. His discovery gave them all a break. There were only one or two leaks in the house's seals, and an army was not needed to keep him safe. Just a few.

""Bang.""

I vocalize it, feeling a shiver run down my spine. Grinning, I nearly shout again, ""Bang. Boom. Kapow! Game over.""

Each incantation of onomatopoeia is followed by a convulsion of my body, with the knowledge that my brain, entangled with brains 100% identical to it in separate universes, is one of the few ones surviving this moment. In other worlds, I *do* pull the trigger, each *bang* or sputtering I evoke with my lips being a genuine gunshot for some other ""me"", in another universe.

I turn to the window, briefly considering shooting through it and jumping out, waiting for the 14 seconds in between my decision not to go through with it and the drop to the ground, ending the life of another ""me.""

I shivered. It was the fifth time I had done so that day, which was strange, given that it had been a minimum of 70 degrees for the whole day. I shrugged it off and returned to my book.

Marvin sat in a chair on his back porch, reading a newspaper. He was an unremarkable man, with short brown hair, lightly tanned skin, and round glasses. The orange glow of the sunset reflected off of the lenses of his glasses as he set his newspaper down for a bit to stare out into the distance. 
He smiled a bit. He had always enjoyed watching the sunset, and was glad that he had done so for once. Marvin closed his eyes, contemplating life. 
He would never open them again.

~~~~~

I shivered again.
Starting to get a bit worried, I wondered if I was getting a fever. I set my book down, putting a bookmark in it, and then got up to go to the bathroom.

~~~~~

Marvin ""Marvel"" Reinhardt peeked out of the alley he was holed up in. The flashing red and blue lights revealed the presence of more police officers just around the corner.
""Blast! Still there."" He grumbled under his breath as he ducked back into the alley. He reached into his jacket for a handgun and loaded it.
The sound of footsteps outside of the alley became clear to Marvel's ears. Just as the footsteps reached the edge of the alley, he turned toward their source and shot. 
His aim was true, and the officer who had come to detain him fell to the ground, dead.
Now that that problem was dealt with, he had to... Oh. Right. He had blown his cover. 
Marvel really hadn't thought this plan through. 
The sound of several officers rushing toward the alley grew louder.
""I can't be caught!"" Marvel grumbled, fumbling in his jacket for a suicide pill. He knew he couldn't take all of the officers. 
He put the pill in his mouth and burst it open, swallowing the powder inside. 
He was dead just before the officers turned the corner. 

~~~~~

Another shiver. 
I grabbed my thermometer from the cabinet above the sink, took its plastic casing off, and put it in my mouth. 
After just over a minute, I heard a beep from it and removed it from my mouth. 
98.7. Normal temperature. That's odd. 
I guess I'll never know what's been giving me all of these chills today.
I shrugged. Perhaps a shower would make me feel better. 
I stripped my clothes off and got into the shower, turning the water on. I reached for my shampoo, only to find that it was on the opposite side of the shower. I groaned and took the two steps over to it, picking it up before turning around and stepping back. On my first step, however, I slipped. The back of my skull hit the shower wall and I screamed in pain. I fell further and my neck hit the edge of the tub and snapped. My eyes rolled back in my head, and then...

"[WP] Whenever you get chills, you just died in an alternate universe.",Alekosen,"Tuesdays are harder than Mondays. You've already worked a full day and the majority of the work week is still staring you in the face. It's even tougher when your cubicle has a view of the crisp blue morning sky outside. What I wouldn't give for a reason not to be at work...

Sarah looks beautiful today. I mean, she looks beautiful everyday, but today it almost seems like she's shining. Her radiant blonde hair let down past her shoulders and her soft blue eyes are enough to make me weak in the knees. Even though she sits just ten feet away, I've never managed to muster the courage to talk to her. I mean *really* talk to her. ""I'm going to do it today"", I mumbled nervously. It was almost a daily mantra. 

She glanced over my direction and caught me mid-stare. Crap. I darted my eyes quickly back to the screen ahead of me and began typing again. I heard a soft chuckle shared between her and Barry. Why was I *staring* so long. People can tell when you're looking at them... almost like you're focusing invisible energy their direction. 

Footsteps. She's coming to talk to me. I can feel my cheeks heat up as I double-down on my bluff by hammering away at the keys in front of me. 

""Good morning."" she chirped with a coy half-smile. Even when she's poking at me she's perfect. 

""Sarah! H-Hi. Uh, yeah, good morning! How are you?"" I wondered if she could tell how flustered I was. *Maintain composure. You can do this.* 

""A little tired and a little hungry, but fine otherwise. Y-"" 

""We should go for a coffee!"" I blurted with near immediate regret. If there's one thing my pops didn't teach me, it was how to talk to women. 

""Oh. Isn't it a little early for a break? I mean-""

""Goodness, you're right."" I interrupted. ""I don't know what I was thinking... Sorry. I mean, work only just started, right? Heh... It'd be pretty weird if we just left after arriving...""

""Actually, I'm starving. I slept through my alarm this morning and didn't have time to do anything but rush to work. Think anyone would notice if we left?""

Another smile. This woman could surely unravel me like a kitten to a ball of yarn. A bead of sweat found its way to my brow as I considered the conversation with my boss if my desk was discovered empty. I doubted I had the nerve to play hooky, let alone head out for an impromptu breakfast with Sarah. I knew I had to decline.
________________________________________________________________

I didn't manage to say a word the entire 39-storey elevator ride down. I stood there rigid as a board and felt the pressure in my ears build until the release just before we made it to the ground floor. The late summer morning was a bit chilly and helped me get my faculties about me. 

""So,"" she asked. ""Where are we headed?""

""I know a little place just off Church St."" I suggested.

""Sounds great!"" 

The city engulfed us in a rehearsal of hums, honks and chatter. After a short walk, we found ourselves at a small espresso bar perfumed with the wonderful aroma of freshly ground coffee beans. Though I've always loved the smell, the taste never really appealed. She ordered a latte macchiato and biscotti and I asked for a tea. We found a lone table at the back of the crowded cafe and sat down. 

Why is it that, when you so desperately want to talk, it's so hard to find something to say? She spoke first. 

""So, rumour has it you're a bit of a nerd.""

I nearly sputtered out some tea. Great. The woman of my dreams thinks I'm a dork. 

""Uh, yeah, I guess you could say that. I guess Barry must have let that go, huh? I  just really like to interact with people and I find games to be the best medium to do so. Video games... board games... I guess that is pretty nerdy.""

""That's not so bad."" She chimed. ""You know, I enjoy-""

Hi. My name is... uhhh. I can’t... remember. Hang on, let me check my bracelet. Lavender? That doesn’t sound right. I’m a guy. Oh well. The nice people in the white coats say I have a problem with my brain. I can’t remember what they said it was. It began with a P, I think. Or maybe it was a T. Anyway, my roommate was nice, when he wasn’t ranting his head off about some poor woman he saw getting vivisected by what he called “the beings.” 

Life was simple.

Lights out meant bedtime. Lights on meant wake up. Women of different shapes and colors came to my room to give me pills and shots when they said I needed them. Some of them grew bright and hot in my vision, and I didn’t like them. I would go off at them, yelling and screaming uncontrollably, like someone else had strings attached to my limbs and were moving them for me. I never saw those women again after a tantrum. They’d bring me food and water when I wanted them.

Strange men began to appear. People entered my room at all hours of the day and jammed syringes into my veins day after day. They said there were doing “experiments” to help me get better. I hated it. I wished they would all just go away.

Bright lights filtered their way through my eyelids in my sleep. I opened my eyes and was dazzled by the brightness. I began to feel the strings pulling my limbs against my will. I ran around the room, screaming and yelling for the light to go away. It wasn’t lights on time, it was light off time. Sleep time. This was a break from the regular, the routine, the normal. The bright man yelled something at me, trying to get my attention. He held up a metal device and moved his hand around it. There was a loud buzzing sound and my muscles tensed up. I writhed in pain on the ground until I moved no more.

Hi. My name is Auburn. I’m twenty-five, male, and love long walks on the beach. Oh, I’m also a serial killer. I loved killing. The feel of it. The rush of capturing a new victim. The thrill of watching them scream in pain. And finally, the climax of the death itself.

I used to get these chills before I started my campaign of murder. They were a little worrisome for a while, but they don’t bother me anymore.

One day, after a particularly glorified day of murdering some dumb bitch, a strange man met me in the street. He walked up to me, introduced himself as King Lairian (what an egomaniac) and his three associates. He chatted with me for a few minutes. Once that I got a closer look at him, I’m startled by what he’s wearing. Bright colors clash magnificently and horribly with each other on him and his companions. The whole effect is dazzling. Staring at it too long made me sick. Once we finished our little chat, he went on his way, walking down the street and disappearing behind a color. I watched them go. What a strange group of people.

.............................

Hi. My name is Azure. I’m twenty-five, female, and live in Mexico, near the border of what used to be the United States. I’m rather hot-tempered with a quick fuse. I go off real easy, since my dad left our family.

I scrounged around for a living, working here and there, never for too long. People were nice to me, I think because I was rather dainty and pretty. Even with my ill-mannered temper, I always found a job.

Shivers ran down my spine all day every day uncontrollably. I hated it, it drove me mad. There was no explanation, and there was no way I could afford a doctor.

One day, walking to work in the newest restaurant that opened near the border, I saw a strange group of people. I instantly looked down, because if they were strangers, then it was likely they were with one of the military organizations. They were cruel to the average citizens and didn’t mind killing anyone who looked at them in a way they didn’t like. Even though it might have cost me my life, I couldn’t help but glance up at them. They were so brightly dressed, even in this sun they gleamed like lights over a dark sea. Four of them walked up the street in my direction, as I headed to them. The brightest man, in the middle, smiled widely, insanely as he saw me. He picked up the assault rifle that hung by his shoulder-strap and yelled at the top of his lungs, “One thousand!!” He shot his assault rifle in the air as he bellowed. I had no idea what this meant, but I knew it couldn’t have been good. I turned to run, but he angled the gun down at me, continuing his spray of bullets.

Hi. My name is Brick. Not sure why my parents chose such a dumb name for me, but there ya go. Even though my name is dumb, I’m not. I think, to counteract the fact I had such a dumb name, I tried harder in school than other kids, getting smarter than them, proving my name wasn’t true. I made it to twenty-five before something remotely exciting happened in my life.

Chills haunted me through-out my day. They wouldn’t stop. They became more and more frequent and lasted longer and longer. I kept it to myself, incase it was some horrid mental disease and people thought I was crazy.

One day, the chills suddenly stopped. Occasionally, I’d have one once in a great while, but never did the attacks begin with such frequency as they once did.",Yulgalminakf
"[WP] Whenever you get chills, you just died in an alternate universe.",Alekosen,"I was the first case they encountered.  They said it was some sort of ""trans-dimensional quantum entanglement"".  I don't really know or care what the fuck that means.  I probably should, it's unwilling incarceration, and ethical horrors I can't even begin to describe.

Dr. Krosky explained it, in the beginning.  He said that that ""shiver"" I felt was some sort of bond breaking, across all the possibilities.  He said that there were an infinite number of ""me"" somewhere, and we were all mirrors of each other, paths not taken.  Different choices made.  Different rolls of the dice.  Back in 8th grade, I wasn't late for that midterm and passed US History the first time, instead of re-taking it; I was late but sweet-talked Mrs. Jones; I wasn't late, but I just failed; I was 20 minutes early and Mrs. Jones and I fucked on her desk.  A thousand million different possibilities for every moment of every life.

Dr. Krosky said it happened to everyone but that _I was special_.  I had some sort of link to all of me.  

He was right.  I could _feel_ it.  Dr. Krosky said, in the beginning, that the shivers were only for versions of me that were similar.  Ones that split off recently, like this morning, or a couple days ago.  Versions of me that put butter on their toast, versions of me that left the house a few seconds later than me and ended up slamming into an oncoming motorcycle.  Those versions of me, when they died, they ""resolved the quantum uncertainty"".  And then I'd shiver.

Krosky got a team.  He said he said I was the proof of his life's work, and he paid me well.  He had proven that there were infinite worlds, and every world was a branch off this one.  Our reality, our universe was the _real_ one.  Or at least, the first one.  He said that I was the conduit.  

Looking back, I should've run then.  I shivered when he told me, and he arched an eyebrow asking me, ""Did it happen again?""  I nodded, and he glanced at some readout and exclaimed, ""It did!  Look, there's the spike!""  He said he'd make the link stronger.  ""Imagine what we could do..."" he'd mutter to himself, when he thought I wasn't paying attention.

Krosky figured me out.  He used me as a template, something about me was built right.  He found others that were linked.  Turns out there were millions of us.  More than enough, he said, for his project.   We really should've refused, but how could we?  

Krosky had a team.  He had hundreds of people -- scientists, engineers, astrophysicists -- the Krosky Project was what people went to school and graduated to join.  He was building The Resonator.  It was in the desert, the only place with enough open land, he'd explained to me.  By now, the Link, as he'd called it, was the strongest it'd been.  I'd gotten used to the shivering.  It was happening all the time.  I found if I lived my life in the safest way possible, I'd shiver less.  

As part of his project, the transmitters he'd designed were scattered throughout society.  They had to be near you to work, but that's easy -- they were incredibly small.  They went into phones and watches and eyeglasses and footwear and wallets and purses and chairs and keyboards and any other place or thing that a human interact with.  You couldn't go through your day without rubbing up against fifty of them.  

The transmitters helped.  They reduced the shivering.  Krosky apologized to me one day.  He said, ""I'm sorry,"".  I asked him for what, and he just motioned to me, encompassing my whole, shivering body.  ""For this,"" he'd said.  And then he turned away, back to his work.  I do recall that was the day that the shivering stopped.  I asked him why the next time I saw him.  He looked sad, but said that he'd resolved the issue, but refused to talk more.  I knew my friend well enough by then to not press the issue.  

The end result was amazing.  The Resonator generated _power_.  Vast amounts of it.  We had more than we knew what to do with. In a few short decades after Krosky's death, we'd built skyscrapers that left the atmosphere.  We'd sent machine and man to every corner of the solar system.  We tossed out concepts like efficiency.  Who needed it?  We just turned the Resonator up another notch when it started to wane.  

So few people really understood what it was doing though.  Do you remember before the Resonator?  Your grandmother might.  I do.  We had _electricity_.  So few knew how it worked, but it was everywhere.  We shipped it off across the continent along wires.  You've seen the old towers, right?  There's some examples in the Smithsonian.  There's even a little generator with a hand-crank!  You should go, it's a fascinating technology.  I wonder if you'll ever have the chance, again.

But you know how the Resonator works, right?  You've learned in school, it's simply resolves those quantum states into something favorable for us.

"[WP] Whenever you get chills, you just died in an alternate universe.",Alekosen,"It's tough work, being a Death Corrections Officer. You see some really messed up shit down there, but the worst thing is, there's not a single person in the DCO who will give you an ounce of sympathy. They've all seen things just as bad as you have, and they're struggling through just fine, so why should you need any help?

I suppose I should explain just what the DCO is. There's a plan to the world; a rhyme and a reason to the way things are *supposed* to go. Except, every so often, things...don't go according to plan. That's when we step in. Find the event in question, shift in an alternate universe to patch the prime one, and boom, the world continues on its merry way. Easy.

But not fun. See, you've gotta look at what happened to see how to stop it. That means looking at death, five or ten times a day, every day. Something like that changes a man. You normals get away with just a little shiver up your spine, a faint memory of the former universe, but we have to watch you die, sometimes over and over again, five, six times.

And then there's *you* assholes. Of all the fuckin' hobbies you had to take up...do you know how much it *sucks* to have to rescue the same dude a couple thousand times in the same fuckin' day? Don't even ask me how the hell youtube videos can cause all the accidents they do, I've got no fuckin' idea. Just know that I hate you, I hate everything about you, and I hope you die.

Oh wait. You already did. Again, and again, and again, and again, and...

Shit, I need a drink.

God this job sucks.

"[WP] Whenever you get chills, you just died in an alternate universe.",Alekosen,"Just as I was about to speak, my N8250 buzzed in my pocket. It was a text from my best friend Matt. *Hey! Are you alright? Call me now!* Sarah grabbed my arm and said, “We need a plan. Now.” She shuddered noticeably.
 
“Are you alright?” I asked.

“Yeah, just getting cold I guess. I can’t stop shivering…”

“I felt a huge chill go through me right as that second explosion hit too.”

“Anyway back to here and now, I think we need to leave.”

“And go where?” I asked. “We don’t know what’s out there and we don’t know what’s causing these booms. People are running around frantically and there are emergency vehicles suddenly screaming down the street. Outside is chaos.”

“Have you got a better idea?” She demanded.

“Assuming this is being done by a person or group” I started, “they must clearly have an objective. Rob a bank, kill some people, something like that. The last place they’ll be headed is an espresso bar. If it’s some sort of natural disaster or freak accident, this two-storey brick building seems as safe a place as any to camp out.”

“Why… does it feel like you’ve played this out in your head before?”

“… I think a lot in the shower. Sometimes that’s about being a hero in the event that it’s necessary… alright?” 

“Well, I suppose you’ve got some good points. We can stay here while we continue to think of a good plan. I don’t exactly feel safe in the middle of all this and I’d like to get far away from here as soon as I can.”

I called over to the people behind the bar to let them know we were coming over. The last thing we needed was paranoia or a confrontation in our safe space. After introducing ourselves and trying to get everyone calm and rational, we began to discuss our options. We agreed that it would be best to try to stick together as a group. 

The choice of whether to stay or go came down to a vote. An older woman and I wanted to stay put until matters were resolved and the well-dressed gentleman and the barista elected to take their chances and head out into the scream and siren filled outdoors. 

“Sarah?” I asked as we all turned to her for the fifth and deciding vote. She genuinely seemed split herself. After a couple seconds of careful thought, she voted to head outside. 

“Sorry.” She muttered to me softly. “I just have a gut feeling that we need to get away from here.” I was a little let down that she didn’t vote with me… especially having given her my rationale before as to why we should. The phone began buzzing in my pocket again. It could wait until we were safe. 

The woman who voted with me announced that they were staying regardless of the group’s decision but wished us luck and said she would pray for us. Though I am not a believer, I thanked her and turned towards the front of the shop. Sarah went to grab her purse and coat, we quickly grabbed some food from the display and left a bunch of money on the counter. It seemed like everyone was ready to venture into the unknown. 

**CRRRRRUXXXH**

The shrill screeching of metal and a chorus of glass exploding sang everywhere. I shuddered violently as every nerve and fibre in my being fired in unison. It was unlike anything I had ever experienced. It felt like my soul tried to escape by running up my spine and through my skull. 

The scraping and metallic noises intensified until it culminated in an excruciating yet muffled thud. I found myself on the floor, slightly contorted and in shock when I locked eyes with Sarah again. For the moment I saw her, I felt her similar distress. Like an empathic link opened between us, we communicated our fear, our experience, and our sympathy for one another. I went to reach out to her when, almost instantly, a wave of dust and debris flew in through the windows covering everything and everyone like a blanket of soot.",Algific

They started out in little waves- lasting for a few seconds longer each time they occurred; perhaps two every minute at the least and as much as twenty to twenty five at their peak. 
Today I hit fifty.  
No, it wasn't just one, really long, shiver, it was fifty distinct sometimes crippling rattlings; it was like my skeleton was trying to escape from my skin.
Overwhelming dread would envelop me, all the colour in the world would seem duller, as if it had lost its quintessential spark. It was terrifying.
Right now I'm on number thirty two and I'm only forty seconds in, I think I may be going for the record. 
I'm starting to hear things, strange things, like distant, echoing cries. The most disturbing of all is I feel like I recognise the cries, recognise the desperate voice.
They are getting louder, almost as if the source of the turmoil is getting closer, breaking down the barrier to reach me.
Forty seven in fifty seconds. 
The screams are unimaginably clear now, I can hear every crack in the owner's voice, many times I have had to look around to check they were not in the room.
Fifty six in the same number seconds. 
Everything seems grey-scale now, like a bad instagram filter, it is like my world is dying.

"[WP] Whenever you get chills, you just died in an alternate universe.",Alekosen,"Hi. My name is Indigo. Yes, like the color, shut up. I’m just your average twenty-five year old male living his life in California. My life is all about work. Work work work work work work work. Wake up early to go to work. Deal with problems at work. Come home exhausted from work. Get emails about work while at home. Get ready for work the next day. I’m tired of it. I wish my life were more exciting. 

Well, I got my wish.

It started off slowly. Occasionally, I’d feel a chill in the air. At first, I didn’t think much of it. Usually it happened when going to the bathroom, y’know, the pissing shiver you get sometimes. Then it started to happen more frequently, and, not in the bathroom. It would happen when going to bed, when jacking off, or even just sitting there eating a bowl of freaking cereal. It became a real hassle. It started to worry me that something was wrong with my brain, some defect that laid dormant my entire life but is just now starting to reveal itself. 

I went to the hospital to get it checked out. The doctor checked my pulse, my temperature, shined a light in my eye, shoved a black cone in my ear, held down my tongue while I said,”Ahhhhh.” The works. 

Finally, he sat down in his backless, spinning, circular chair and said, “What seems to be the problem today... Indigo?” he says my name with a question as if asking me he’s saying it right.

I opened my mouth to tell him what’s wrong, but I had no idea where to start. After a long pause, with my mouth hanging open stupidly, I finally got out, “Do you believe in ghosts, doctor?”

The doctor’s look of surprise says he definitely hadn’t heard that one before. “I’m not sure what you mean,” he said slowly, calculatingly. 

“Well, I keep having these... chills. The room goes cold and I feel a shiver down my spine.”

“Chills? So, your first logical step was... ghosts?”

“Yeah, that was my best explanation. That’s why I came to you, doc.”

“Hrm,” the doctor said, pondering. “Well, there are some tests we can perform, if you can afford them.”

“Whatever you need doc. I got the best insurance I could find. I’m cautious like that.” The doctor began to perform all kinds of tests. EKG, MRI, X-RAY, and many other acronyms that he couldn’t remember. All of them came without significant results.

“I am completely stumped. I have no idea what is causing your affliction,” the doctor said in frustration. “Maybe it’s all in your head.”

I rolled my eyes and said, “Well, thanks doc,” with as little sarcasm I can muster. “You were all too happy to waste my time and my insurance’s money with those tests though, weren’t you?”

The doctor looked aghast at my statement, but I didn’t wait around for him to refute it, I just left the room.

Weeks passed with a sharp increase in the amount of chills I experience. They happened several times a day. I used to try to count them, but I lost count at around two hundred. It started to affect my work. My co-workers started to notice my shiverings and they’d tease me with names like, “Blue,” because I always seemed so cold. 

Frustration and anger filled my days. All I wanted to know is why! Why does this keep happening, over and over and over again?!

Well, I got my answer.

It was a normal Saturday afternoon, where I didn’t have to go to work. I had plans later that night to meet up with friends at a bar walking distance from where I lived. There was a bang at the front door, as if someone were trying to break it down. I stopped my hand halfway to my mouth with a spoon filled with the soup I was eating. Silence. Another loud bang at the door and it falls to the ground with a thud. I drop my spoon and run to my bedroom where I know I have a loaded gun to ward off burglars. 

I didn’t even get halfway across the hall when a knee found my groin. A large hand grabbed the back of my head by the hair as I was falling. He pulled me up roughly, and I saw the most bizarre sight of my life. Two men stand on either side of a strangely dressed man with the third holding me up. Each of them were dressed in extremely flashy, neon colored clothes that seemed to light up the room more than the florescent bulbs in the ceiling. If the men beside him were considered flashy, the man standing between them was blinding. I would’ve thought him and his entourage looked hilarious if the situation were different. He had a malevolent grin on his face.

He opened his mouth and an odd, warbling effect accompanied his voice, as if it were coming from speakers on his collar. “I found you again, little bitch.” He then went on to tell me his master plan, not unlike a bond villain. His monologue never ceased for a second, he seemed to take breaths imperceptibly fast so his speech could continue uninterrupted. 

Apparently, in some far distant universe, I had pissed this guy off. Really, really bad. So he vowed he would kill me a thousand times. He leans in close and whispers in my ear, “Three hundred and forty-three,” before he jabs a knife into my sternum. I never even got to find out what I even did to piss him off.

.............................

Hi. My name is Violet. Yes, like the color, shut up. I know it’s a girl’s name, shut up again. I’m just your average twenty-five year old male living in Mumbai. That’s somewhere in India, not sure where exactly. I moved here for the women. My life is all about sex. Sex sex sex sex sex sex sex. Wake up with a woman in my bed. Find women everywhere I go. Bring women home to have sex. Get texts from women I’ve sexed in the past. I love my life. It’s exactly what I want it to be.

It all went so wrong.

It started off slowly, but grew quickly. Chills when doing ordinary activities, such as pissing, eating waffles, and it even started to affect me when having sex. At times like this, I wish I were more careful with my money so I could afford to go to the doctor’s to get it checked out. No insurance meant no medical care, and paying for a doctor’s visit outright was ridiculous.

It was affecting my love life. While having sex, I’d get these weird spasms of chills and it would completely demoralize me. The woman I was with at the time would invariably laugh at me, call me a joke, and leave, saying that I was such a disappointing fuck and hadn’t lived up to their friends’ hype.This chills thing pissed me the fuck off. I hated it. I wished it would just go away.

Well, in a way, it did.

On an average day in summer, after a particularly bad day of striking out with women in one of my usual spots (I had a couple massive chills that made them weary) I went home, frustrated. I couldn’t stand it anymore. I went to bed early.

A loud crash in the next room woke me up and I threw off my covers and ran toward the noise. As I entered the room, a sharp pain met me in the side of the head. I fell to the ground, bleeding from my ear. The room spins maddeningly. I’m picked up roughly from the ground and made to stand, but I’m so wobbly that whoever picked me up simply had to hold me there.

A brightly colored man swam into view. As he spoke, I could barely understand him, a high-pitched noise began to drown him out from my busted ear. He said something about me doing something to him. I couldn’t remember ever seeing his face before. I try to speak, but whatever broke my ear, must’ve damaged my brain too, for speech came out warbled, disjointed, and unintelligible. He stopped his speech mid-sentence, looked at the state I was in, and gave up on his long-winded explanation. He leaned in close and whispered into my good ear, “Four hundred and twelve.” He took a needle from a hidden pocket in his clothes and injected something into my veins. Pain spidered out from the injection site and I fell twitching to the ground as whoever held me up released me. The last thing I saw was bright lights, that walked away from me.

.............................

Hi. My name is Ruby. Yes, like the color. I’m just an unimportant twenty-five year old female. The doctors say I’m depressed and gave me drugs to help. I’ve tried to live my life, but it’s just too much work. I suck. Life sucks. Everything sucks. No one needs me and no one would miss me if I just disappeared.

Life got even harder.

It started off slowly, and crippled me immediately. Chills ran through my body, and the doctors all thought it was adverse affects of the medication they put me on, so they started to wean me off of them. Nothing helped. I hated that I was losing my mind. The shivers made me wish even more strongly that I was dead. 

Well, I got my wish.

Early Monday morning, after I had called into work lying I was sick, I heard a knock on the door. I went to answer it and for one blinding moment, I thought the circus had paraded itself to my front door. I got one glimpse of the brightly dressed men, before a strong hand clamped around my throat. My survival instinct took hold and I clawed at his hand with my nails, but he just squeezed harder. A grin spread across his face. He leaned in close and whispered in my ear, “Six hundred and ninety-three.” That’s all I heard before I blacked out.

"[WP] Whenever you get chills, you just died in an alternate universe.",Alekosen,"Nine thousand six hundred and forty-two. That is the number of times I have died. Oh, not here in my universe of course. It's other Arnolds that have died. My name is Arnold by the way. It's crazy to think of how many parallel universes there are and how many times ""I"" have died, but it all makes sense if you really think about it for just a second.

 I haven't per say witnessed any of these deaths of my other selves, but I have experienced them. You may be wondering, how do  I experience these deaths? Well, it's no big secret because you experience them too! 

Before I go into too much detail, you should know that it will sound a little crazy, at first. It's when you get the chills. You know that feeling that runs up your spine and makes you spasm a little? That's it, that is you number... 1 or 1,000,00 dying.

 I always recorded down the chills I've gotten since I can remember and then one night some odd years ago I had a dream; in the dream the I saw me, a thousand mes dying in so many odd ways, and the days I had experienced too (without the dying bit). I knew then that my records were for a reason, to remember all my deaths. 

How is this relevant to you in any way? Well, I've developed a rather innovative and fun little gadget. The chill counter? It's like one of those bracelets that keep track of your heart beat and number of steps you've taken, but this one instead counts and tracks your multiverse deaths. It also gives you a small alert after each chill so you can have a moment of silence for yourself or celebrate the fact that you've outlived another one of yourselfs. 

So, how about it? For only 19.99 USD this marvelous bracelet can let you know of the impending doom you yourself aren't facing just quite yet? ",Axing

The cash register chimes merrily.  My hand brushes hers as I hand over the money. My chest two-steps to the left when her hazels meet my deep browns.  If only fairy tales came true.

Warm sunlight fills the shop.  Gems and rainbows lance the windows.  Cast from an armada of puddles on the asphalt. Thunderheads have passed this way.  Another hour at breakneck speed and nature will hold a lecture on mid-western weather patterns.

""Have a nice day...""

Turning, I give her my best Humphrey Bogart smile, right hand rising to wave my goodbye. But her hazels have gone all grey.  I'm no longer the apple of her eye.   Something's larger maw swallows my silhouette on the floor.  Cool air kisses my arm where Sol was once the lover.  Skin prickles. *Behind me...*

The room explodes.

It rushes past and Death rustles my hair. My old friend reminding me our tee-time approaches, hour TBA.  Maroon spills on linoleum. Smells of copper and gasoline complement hot dogs and french fries.  A Volvo plaque bigger than my palm hangs smugly over the counter where my shadow once stood.  

Here though, the ground is pristine.  Gems and rainbows dance now from shards hanging from the window panes. Birds chatter amongst each other about nothing in particular.  Sirens announce a terrible thing has happened.  Ice runs up my spine and into my chest, squeezing just enough to remind me I survived.  

But that's not entirely true.

""Get excited folks! We'll announce the winner at the five!""  Seems the DJ survived the last big hit's finale too. No jackpot tonight though. Not without my say.

"[WP] Whenever you get chills, you just died in an alternate universe.",Alekosen,"A pane of glass shattered at the front of the shop. It sounded like a car backfired in the booth next to us. I jumped so hard that I tipped the table towards Sarah tossing two hot beverages and half a cookie her direction. 

She screamed. 

A thousand thoughts went racing through my head. What was that sound? Was it a gun? Are we in danger? Is Sarah okay? Was she shot?

""Oh my God, Sarah, are you alright?!"" I managed to choke out while lifting the table off of her.

""Shit that hurt! What were you- ugh, never mind. I'm fine. What was that?!""

I tipped the table down towards the shattered window and dropped behind it. 

""Get down."" I said sharply and she complied. 

Other patrons were shouting noisily and fleeing or hunkering down low in their booths or behind chairs. No one seemed to know what had happened or what was going to happen. After a few tense minutes of relative silence, people began to gather the courage to look around and investigate the cause of the noise and the broken window. 

On couple of people on the street seemed to be staring at something in the distance. Something in the sky...

I went around to the staff and customers checking in with them to make sure everyone was alright when I noticed Sarah doing the same. We locked eyes for a moment and I thought I caught her cheeks redden as she looked back to the elderly man she was tending to. He had been sitting close to the window when it shattered. Sarah somehow had supplies and was dressing a small wound on his hand at a booth away from the window. 

""Where did you get first-aid supplies?"" I asked as I walked over to them.

""My mother is a nurse and a paranoid mother. She insists that I carry stuff like this around for emergencies. ...I guess maybe she had a point. When I was young I wanted to be a nurse. To grow up and be just like my mom...""

""I hope she didn't teach you how to bandage someone. That dressing looks like I tried to wrap a present!"" *Whap* She struck my arm playfully and gave me her best glare. Maybe it was the adrenaline from the previous events, or maybe I started to find the courage to talk to her. Either way and despite the strange circumstances, I felt like I was meant to be here with Sarah at this moment. 

Sirens began to wail in the distance.

""Well,"" she said. ""I suppose we should be getting back to work. We've been gone for a while and I haven't exactly got any coffee left to drink.""

""You still have half a cookie to finish."" I said, emboldened by our previous interaction.

""That's enough with that, Mister!"" she said through a grin. ""Besides, we haven't even figured out how you're going to repay me for this botched breakfast, let alone my coat and pur-""

**KA-BOOM**

The second noise took the rest of the windows at once. A strong shiver went coursing through my whole body. Ears ringing, dazed and dumbfounded, I felt a hand grab mine and pull me back towards far wall of the cafe. Sarah yanked me behind the table and ducked down out of sight of the windows. 

""What the hell?!"" She yelled. ""I thought it was over!? What is going on?"" 

People were running on the streets in seemingly every direction. The few people left in the cafe hid behind the counter with the barista and waited, praying for safety. Sarah and I looked to each other for what we should do next.",Algific

The emergency broadcast an hour ago had given people a chance to try and come to terms with the ruination of the human race. The announcer had a breakdown while stuttering through the notice that peace talks had failed. Mutually assured destruction: no-one was walking away from this.

Some ran. Some rioted. Some gave up. Many cried.

"[WP] Whenever you get chills, you just died in an alternate universe.",Alekosen,"This is normal.  My alarm goes off at 6:30 AM and the last of the alcohol has worn off.  Well, not the last.  I still have plenty in my system, or what would be plenty for most people.  I stagger down to the fridge in my boxers.  Tough choice, miller lite or bud lite?  Miller lite is the closest choice so I take that.  I need at least two beers before I leave for work, or I can't drive.  The chills start after six hours without a drink, but I was up until two last night, so I'm fine.  The cold shower helps to wake me up, but the most important player is the vyvanse that my roommate is prescribed, and uses to help pay his rent.  Two beers, two cups of coffee, and two pisses later I'm ready for another day at work.

Amazon really needs to have their drones start delivering booze.  It's a huge pain to drive to different liquor stores all over town.  You start to get looks buying a fifth at six and then running back at 8:50 to buy another before the stores close.  Maybe I should move to Louisiana.  I hear gas stations sell liquor.  Forget all that for now, I've got my flask in my suit and I'm ready to get through the day.  

Being an alcoholic isn't easy.  It sounds glorifying, the romantic alcoholic, unable to find peace in this world writes his music while drinking alone.  That isn't what it's like.  Last month I had a panic attack because of a business trip I went on to Pennsylvania.  My flight arrived in the evening, after they stop selling alcohol, and I spent the night shaking in a cold sweat.  You have to plan everything out, because once sobriety hits, so do the symptoms.  

The headache is bad.  The sweat is bad.  But the chills are the worst.  The worst.  Most people get them after watching The Twilight Zone when home alone with the lights out.  Ha.  They are constant when I am sober.  I don't think most people really recognize what the chills are.  A brief spasm of paranoia and then a quick light hearted giggle at yourself.  They are different when you get them a lot.  And I get them a lot.

It took me awhile to notice it.  I wasn't always a heavy drinker.  I actually never drank in high school, because it was wrong.  I wasn't 21, but I was old enough to die in Iran or Iraq or whatever place the government decides to ship you off to, and that really hit home when my best friend got himself blown up by stepping on an mine in Afghanistan.  If the government said he was old enough to die, I was old enough to have a fucking beer.  And I had one.  And another.  And another.  

At first the chills aren't really that bad.  The headache and other flu like symptoms that start to effect your body when the alcohol leaves are much worse.  The thing you don't notice is the cry.  Next time you get the chills, try to listen for it.  Or don't.  You won't hear it, I have no doubt.  I kept getting them nightly for two years before I started to notice.  Now I hear it every time.  It's not your mom or your sister or your best friend crying.  It's you.  It's the most gut wrenching saddest cry I have ever heard.  The cry of someone who has met the devil himself.  The cry I never want to hear again.

I know this alcohol is killing me, but I can't stop.  I keep going, living my life on an autopilot designed by someone as suicidal as myself.  The booze doesn't give me the warm feeling anymore.  It doesn't make me happy anymore.  It doesn't make me forget anymore.  But it does stop the chills.",TheNotZParty
"[WP] Whenever you get chills, you just died in an alternate universe.",Alekosen,"Way back when there was a superstition that it was triggered by someone walking over your grave. Wherever that came from, someone either had a vague idea what was actually happening, or got lucky. I don’t know too much about it, but the reality was stumbled on shortly after the other dimensions were discovered. We don’t know quite how many there are but it’s likely in the low thousands, the scientists have had cameras and recording devices sent between them for years now and we have a good idea what goes on, but sending anything living through is impossible so no one has been able to visit. Unlike what we see in a lot of fiction there’s no world where hte Nazis one, Dinosaurs and man live together, WWIII happened, history has been pretty much the same, just certain people die at different times which it turns out doesn’t really matter in the grand scheme of things.

It happens a few time a year, increasing as you get older and your chance of dying increases, both in regularity and strength. Physically it’s the same but everyone reacts to it differently, some people have apps or books and keep a track of times and dates, some ignore it and pretend nothing happened, some get so guilty they consider ending it, which brings with it the dilemma that they will be pushing the same feelings onto another them.
Sometimes you’ll feel the shivers close together, when the timelines of a few worlds are well aligned enough that you die in two or more at the same time. Occasionally they will stop you in your tracks when you realise what has happened. On a rare occasion, by far the worst, the timelines are aligned with yours in a way that you know what has happened, a car crash, near drowning, fall, the life flashing before your eyes isn’t yours, it’s the life of the version of you that wasn’t so lucky.

For me recently it’s been different. It started a few weeks back, I was woken with a start, it was almost a convulsion. I figured it must have just been amplified by the hangover to start with, but then it happened again a few hours later. At first I though it must have been two worlds a few hours out of sync, which wouldn’t be that rare, but then it happened again. Over the next few days it continued with increasing regularity and intensity. I paid a visit to the doctor to see if it was something else, figuring it could be down to an illness, but they couldn’t find anything. I tried some of the internet forums, along with the usual conspiracy bullshit, everything's made up, they put something in our water to control us, chemtrails, etc., there were a few instances of this happening to other people, just like me they were scared.

There was only lady who was local, we arranged to meet for a coffee. She was visibly shaken, like me hadn’t slept properly since it started happening and hadn’t left the house much for fear of people thinking we were losing it. We sat in silence and stared at each other for what seemed like hours, just being in the company of someone else who knew what we were going through help more than I had expected. Then I felt it, one of the strongest I’d had, across the table I could see the same happened to her, the coffee slipped out of her hands onto the floor and she crumped, head to her knees and started sobbing. The barista hearing the mug shatter came over to see what had happened, at this point she was inconsolable and I was paralysed in shock. I don’t know how long we were like that for, but when we regained composure we made our apologies and left. Looking back on what followed it probably wasn’t the best option, but we parted ways agreeing to meet back up shortly when we had the energy to converse.

I spent the next few hours thinking over what had happened, were there other versions of us in other worlds going through the same thing? I knew that some of them got the shivers too, so chances are in one of the other worlds another me is also sitting here right now trying to work out what is going on. And the fact we both felt it at the same time, was that coincidence, or was there a chance that there was a world where we were both killed at the same time? Does that somehow make the shiver stronger? Would it explain the emotional pull that came with it? At that point my phone rang, it was her. I’m sorry, she started, I interrupted her and made it clear there was nothing to apologise for, reassured her that I felt the same thing and had pretty much the same reaction. We spoke for a while, with us both feeling vulnerable and alone I invited her to spend the evening at mine, she was a short cab journey away, so agreed she would be round it about half an hour. After we hung up I poured another glass of wine and decided to use the half hour to have a quick shower, hoping it might make me feel a little more human.

Half an hour passed and she didn’t show, it reached an hour and still no show, or response to my calls, my worry turned to fear, I couldn’t call the police as they wouldn’t believe me, or care, I told myself I didn’t know anything about her, she could have got distracted, met up with a friend or family nearby, or just changed her mind about coming to visit someone she had only met once, she owed me nothing. After a few hours I finished the bottle, gave up and went to bed to attempt some sleep.

Something woke me during the night. At first I thought it must have been a shiver, that’s when it dawned on me,I hadn’t had one since the coffee shop earlier, I had got used to them being every hour or so, but this has been pretty much a full day, at least 18 hours, and I had felt nothing. Why had it stopped?
I suddenly felt sick as it crossed my mind, was I the only one left?
Rushing to the bathroom I turned on the taps, feeling the cold water against my face made the sick feeling go away slightly, I retched a couple of times, but nothing came up. Making my way back to bed I checked my phone, there was a missed call and a voicemail, that much have been what woke me up. The call was from an unknown number, a local landline, I dialed my voicemail and put it on speakerphone while I got back into bed.
The instant the message started I froze, it started with just heavy breathing, then she spoke, she sounded even more scared than she had earlier.
It’s too late for me she found me, she started. Run, get as far away as you can, change your face, they’re coming for you. Then she screamed and the lady on the voicemail started asking if I wanted to delete the message.
I hung up and started shaking uncontrollably, I had no idea what she meant, but it scared me to death. That was when I heard the door behind me open, I managed to turn my head, but was paralysed from the neck down. All I could think was how strange it was too look at myself not in a mirror as they raised their hands and I struggled to breathe.

"[WP] Whenever you get chills, you just died in an alternate universe.",Alekosen,"A crash, a scream. Chills ran up my back. The psychitrist looked at me funny. ""Mr Jones, are you quite alright?"" he asked, tilting his head slightly as he examined me. 
I had told them time and time again, it wasn't schitzophrenia, it was real! But they never believed me. I took a deep breath and shook off the forboding feeling my 'episodes' generally brought on. 
""Yes, I'm fine"" I replied, fighting the urge to look over my shouldar. ""I'm just tired"" I said, forcing a smile that felt as authentic as a fast food cheeseburger.
Dr Reynheart nodded slowly and wrote down on his clipboard. ""Why don't you tell me about your week? Hmm? Get your mind off things?"" 

I barely had time to open my mouth when I saw a crowbar flying at my face, I ducked of course. Of course I fucking ducked, there was no way I was going to hide that one. ""Not too bad, I've really being enjoying the art classes"" I replied, trying to relax even though my back was tensing up. Those damn chills again. 

The good doctor tutted and made more notes. ""I don't know why you don't let us medicate you, it will help with your episodes"" he told me, his voice dry and hiding just a hint of a hungarian accent. ""You'll feel better, believe me"". 

It was while I was planning what to say next that the sound of a train horn rang through my ears and I jumped out of my chair, landing in the corner of the room. Millions of alternate dimensions, hundreds of thousands of which I didn't even live to age 30 and several hundred an hour where I was dying at that exact moment. I didn't know if I was insane or cursed, but by god would I have given anything at that moment to not have to find out. 

The doctor looked at me and tutted, setting his clipboard down. ""Nurse! Bring a sedative, the patient is experiancing severe distress"" he shouted, while I watched a fire surround me. If this was hell, I was there... ",oliver51293
"[WP] Whenever you get chills, you just died in an alternate universe.",Alekosen,"At first it just seemed like I was crazy, like my memory just didn't work right. Being a kid, I'd talk about how my friend John walked down to the duck pond and got kicked by a mule, and my friend Amy would say, ""no, no, John went to the fair and got kicked by a mule."" I'd know what I was saying was right, because I was there, but then I'd be corrected by six or seven people. ""Johnny was at the fair."" There were even times when I forgot I had a sibling, or that I didn't have a sibling. Sometimes their face would stay the same but their name would change. And sometimes, a name I'd called them yesterday wasn't their name -- instead, their name was what I knew them by a month or a year ago. My parents took me to the doctor and tried to explain it. Soon they just gave me medicine in the hopes that it was treatable. It wasn't.

It started affecting my school life when I got older. Mrs. Lafferty would say that Richard Nixon was at the Watergate Hotel, and I'd say that she'd taught us he'd been at the Folsom last semester. The gym teacher, Mr. Holland, would change the rules in baseball where we'd run around a hexagon of bases instead of a diamond. And then, there were the days when things went back to ""normal"", or at least the most common way of things. Mrs. Lafferty would agree that George Washington crossed the Delaware. Mr. Holland wouldn't use the third hoop in basketball. 

It took me a while to realize what was going on, why it always seemed like stories changed, histories changed, the entire world changed without me knowing. When I finally caught on, after looking in the mirror and seeing the odd little changes in my face, in that freckle or this scar, I'd realize what was happening. Eventually, I'd have to try and keep track of what reality I'm in. And eventually I kept it to myself. Even if it was a slightly different set of parents every couple of weeks or months or years, they were still my parents, and I didn't want them to worry.

I could somehow walk through universes, and I never knew which one I'd end up in.

When I got older and out into the world, it started to get worse. There's just so much more to remember out in the real world. Computers, technology, phones, doctors, lawyers, news -- I had to relearn and relearn and relearn. That was okay, though, because I could always eventually catch up somehow. No, the worst part of the real world is that it is dangerous, and with the real world came the jitters.

It always hits me out of nowhere. Sometimes, I'll be at the corner of the street with my foot off the edge of the curb. I'd find myself getting chilly jitters across my skin, and in that second, I'd feel myself walk across the curb, see a car, and get hit. I'd feel it in that minute -- bones crunch, unimaginable pain, road rash down my left side, suffocating blackness -- and then, in that same minute, it would be gone. I would still be standing at the street, and a red Miata with a texting driver would whiz by.

And I'd never go back to that universe. I'd figured out a system of keeping track of which universe I was in, and that one -- that particular one, in fact, my Elbow Scar universe where I never went to ballet practice and Mom didn't die of heart disease and the US invaded Kuwait and stayed-- just vanished. I never woke up in that world ever again.

I try to stay indoors a lot now. I don't get the jitters when I'm inside. It's a little safer, a little bit less dangerous. I can't walk by streets anymore. I don't go near construction sites. I almost never eat anything at a restaurant. My computer is my best friend, on the days and in the worlds where I know how to use it. But even inside my apartment, I'll get the jitters. I might plug in a laptop, and suddenly I'm electrocuted, only to find myself sitting against a wall bawling with the cord plugged in. Or I'll take a bath and fall asleep, the jitters making my heart tap-dance three milliseconds before I wake up and drown in the tub. There are so many, many little ways to die, and I experience them all.

Sometimes I wonder if there are infinite universes, and if this will keep going. I keep aging, after all, and maybe I'll just die when I finally reach old age. But, if there *aren't* infinite universes -- if there *aren't* an unlimited number of me's out there to die -- I'll never know when my jitters are running out. Each one could be the last before I finally draw the unlucky straw and die. Every act is a flip of the coin. Heads I win, tails I lose.

At this rate, I want to lose that coin toss. ",Ribonacci

It was the time of the Great Countdown. As I walk down the streets I could see the universal projection in the sky, the numbers getting smaller and smaller, from the remaining days down to the last second. The digits seizes me in a crushing hold and instantly, my steps become fueled with panic. I recite a prayer in my head, stuffing my shaking hands into my pockets. 
Please please, just- No-! 
There it was. A running sensation from the back of my neck down to the base of my spine. It was like a trickle of water, or a tiny electrical spark spreading throughout my body. I even felt it at the tips of my fingers and when I did, a strangled cry erupted from my lips. 
This was why I hated going outside. But I did not have a choice, a man has got to feed himself. I pulled the hoodie over my head, biting hard on my molars as I pushed through the glass door, keeping a low gaze on the near-empty shelves of groceries. 
It was hard times and the memories of the last ten years remained fuzzy in my mind. But I remembered the first time they announced it, that the Earth was going to die. And as though that dire piece of news was not enough, they bombed us with another fact that pandemic case of experiencing the chills was in reality not a symptom of a 'harmless' bacterial infection; it was a sickening signal, a heart-wrenching call, that one has died in an alternate universe. 
The scrambling of scientists and researchers happened. With their brains bulging with desperation, daily functions strained with exhaustion, they worked relentlessly on a new theory - our last hope. If it worked, humanity could escape this dying planet and restart on a blank slate. 
We could go to another Earth in an alternate universe.
I could restart in an alternate universe. 
But my chance were limited - I can only go to an alternate universe where 'I' was still alive.

*Save.  Commit.*  Now I just wait for the compiler, and...

That's when it happened.  A shudder ran through my body, starting in my chest and shaking my whole being.

I looked to my left.  My cubicle-mate was just looking at me.  ""Woo,"" he said.

""What?""

""Just got the chills.""

I narrowed my eyes at him.  Then the guy on the other side of the cloth half-wall of the cubicle stood up, with a pretty similar expression on his face.  ""Me, too.""

""I felt it, too,"" I admitted.  And one by one, like prairie dogs, my coworkers began poking their heads up, pulling out earbuds, agreeing that they had felt the same thing.  It had started with me at 1:24 PM, and by 1:35 everybody in my building had felt it.  Some had just thought the heat had been turned off, but we all soon realized that this was something different.

We evacuated the building, assuming that something was in the ventilation system or something.  But as we started talking to people in neighboring buildings, we realized that this had happened to everyone.  Every single person in the city.  Bus passengers, line cooks, taxi drivers, investment bankers, tourists, professional athletes.

Someone near me showed me their Facebook feed on their phone.  People were freaking out on the social network, as they realized that everyone they knew had experienced the same thing at the same time.  It wasn't just in our city, either; people on the other side of the planet were posting about the phenomenon.  Everybody had gotten the chills around 1:30 PM EST.  The earliest time reported was like me, at 1:24.  The latest, 1:37.

By 3:00 it was a worldwide trending topic on Twitter.  All of our local news stations had posted something about it.  I caught a bus home, because there was no way in any universe that I was going to get anything else done today.  The bus was packed, unusual for being so early.  Everybody wanted to get home to their families.  Everybody had felt the same chills at the same time.

A post in /r/science by a doctor talking about the phenomenon hit the front page, but he didn't have much to say that really answered the problem.  I tried to text my wife, but she didn't answer.  Not unusual.  Probably left her phone upstairs again.

When I finally got home, I saw her happily playing with our toddler in the living room.  She looked at me, confused.  ""You're home early.""

""Yeah, well, when that thing happened this afternoon, I just wanted to be here with you.""

Her eyes searched mine.  ""What thing?""

""Didn't you see?  Everybody got the chills at once.""

She looked even more confused.

"[WP] Whenever you get chills, you just died in an alternate universe.",Alekosen,"""I should probably stop going outside until winter is over,"" I thought to myself. 

But that's when it struck me. If I get the chills and an alternate universe-me dies, that probably means that one of the alternate universe-me's will get the chills whenever I die. In order to stay alive, I must get the chills as often as possible to kill off as many of my alternates as I can before one of them gets my ""chill."" 

It's winter. Perfect. Shorts and a t-shirt it is. I will walk around town, stopping in stores to warm up so that I get more chills whenever I come back outside. You know what else winter means? Flu season and various other illnesses. I will as I'm walking around town and in and out of stores, I will look for people coughing and sneezing and immediately go up to them and shake their hand and introduce myself. Boom. Sickness chills. 

I guess I should snag some scary movies while I'm out. That will kill a few more of those motherfuckers before I go to bed. 

Yesterday went well. I probably killed at least 200 alternates. Time to go back out today. Oh, I should mention that I had a nightmare last night and woke up with the chills. Must have been all of the horror flicks last night. A good way to start the day none the less. Also, I have a bit of a scratchy throat and runny nose. Fuck yeah - give me the flu. Time to grab a nice pair of shorts and clean shirt and time to hit the town again. 

It snowed last night. That's sweet. I started to get kinda used to the cold yesterday, so once that happens, I'll just relax in the nice fluffy snow. There's no way I'll get used to that. 

The flu symptoms are really kicking in. My nose won't stop running but the cough... The cough is bad. Oh well, the chills are worth it. The chills are keeping me alive. 

I'm getting used to the cold. Snow angels anyone? (oh, the irony) 

It's getting late and I'm feeling weak. I guess it's time to get home and let the flu chills pick off my alternates one by one. Maybe I'll have another nightmare and work double duty while sleeping. 

I woke up this morning and can barely move. The cough... I can barely catch my breath it's so bad. I need to get out in the cold, but I can hardly move. Maybe I'll just watch some more scary movies and let the flu chills do the dirty work.

Seriously, this cough. I've been coughing up blood and mucus for the past 3 hours. This isn't good, but I'll be alright. As long as I have the chills, I'll be alright. 

More blood. More mucus. Can't breathe. This is bad. Wait, why have the chills stopped? I'm sick as a dog. Man, I'm warm. I'm really, really warm... ",masterianwong

[WP] A suicidal man falls in love with a suicide hotline operator.,Blithium,"Alice had just gotten off a three hour call talking a man down from the forty-fifth floor of his financial firm. She was tired and more than a little pissed off. The guy started listing off his sins -Why they do this, Alice didn't know. It's like they wanted her to scream, ""Yes, you're a horrible person, pull the trigger!- and what she heard really made her stomach turn. 

'Subprime loans 2.0' He had called them. Some bubble was about to burst, the FEC was banging on his door, and he was about swan dive straight into the asphalt.  But Alice went through the steps and instead, he went to hospital. Some nurse would now be loosing sleep keeping him on suicide watch. She worried more about that than if he would have an happy ending. They usually didn't. 

The light on the phone blinked. 

""Next caller, you're on the line."" Said Alice, ""Why is your life not worth living?"" 
 She laughed and then put on her serious face.  She picked up the phone. 

""Suicide Prevention--""

""I'm staring at at a bottle of Xanax and I want to eat all of it.""

Alice sighed and kicked herself. It was Gary. Fucking Gary. Why the hell didn't she look at the Caller I.D. He was one of the ones who just needed attention. 

""Hello Gary,"" greeted Alice, ""Is it Tuesday already?""

""Yes."" sniffled Gary, ""Statistically Tuesdays have the highest rate of suicide, you know that?""

""I do work at a Suicide hotline, Gary""

""I think it's the crushing realization. You have things to do on Monday. All that work you slacked off on last Friday. Then Tuesday comes around and BAM!""

Alice jumped from the sudden noise.

""You realize you got four more days until the weekend, then five more days of work, then another weekend, then five more days and so on and so forth until you get colon cancer and die. I'm genetically prone to it you know?""

Alice giggled. Something about Gary always tickled her. ""I see you've moved on from sitting in the garage with car running."" 

""My shrink gave me a prescription... Plus, I realized my Prius is too green for that. What are you doing?""

""Talking to you. It's kind of my job.""

""Well you're quite good at it.""

""Thank you. What do you have going on tonight?""

""I'm making Lasagne. Maybe I'll stick my head in the oven afterwards.""

Alice smiled and they continued to talk. Gary occasionally threatened his life in various ways. Each threat more benign and increasingly playful. It wasn't until Alice looked at the phone she realized they talked for over four hours. 

Alice just had to know. She never thought about it, but Gary had been a repeat caller for over six months.  

""You never were really going to kill yourself, were you?""

 ""At one time, yes, and you talked me out of it."" Gary then sighed and said, ""Now? I just need to hear someone say they care about my wellbeing. I care so much for others, but I have no one to do that for me... Can I still call a suicide hotline if I'm not suicidal?""

Alice thought about it for a moment then said,  ""I'll see you next tuesday"" 

""No you won't."" Gary joked.  

And they hung up. 

When the following Tuesday rolled around and Alice didn't hear from Gary she grew increasingly worried. She gave him a call from the number he usually used and it went straight to voicemail. 

The next day she called around to the local hospitals and made inquiries.  An hour later one of them called back with the news: He was in St. Joseph's Hospital.
 
Alice rushed straight over and found the nearest nurse. She directed her to a room. A where a man -stout and balding- lay attached to a respirator. Was this Gary?  She started crying. She had failed callers before, but this one hurt so much more than the others. Why did Gary matter so much to her? 

""Excuse me, miss?"" said a male nurse, ""Can I help you?""  Alice turned around.
""What happened to him?"" asked Alice.

""He been on suicide watch since last week. We didn't catch that was hoarding his pills and he overdosed on Xanax. It's tragic, really. I, uh, have continue my rounds.""

The nurse left to go back to work. 

""Oh god, Gary..."" Alice sobbed.

The nurse stopped and turned back around. 

""Yes?"" he said, rather confused, ""I'm sorry, did you say my name?"" 

Alice wiped away a tear and looked at his name tag. 

And smiled.

[WP] A suicidal man falls in love with a suicide hotline operator.,Blithium,"""Hello, suicide helpline."" The voice on the telephone said after three rings.

""Hi, this is Victor."" 

""Oh, it's you again. You want to talk to Alicia, I guess?""

""Yes.""

""Okay, let me transfer you. I have to say though, this dependence on her is not a good thing.""

""Well, considering she's the only thing keeping me alive, I would say it is.""

There was no reply, just a small noise of the line being transferred.

""Hello,"" the most beautiful voice, the most melodious voice in the world said. ""Alicia here. How may I help you?""

Victor took a deep breath. Her voice had that effect on him.

""Oh Victor, it's you again. We just talked two hours ago- for an hour and a half.""

He felt happy and sad that she recognized him by his breathing.

""You can't do this Victor. You have to go out and talk to other people.""

""I only ever wanted to talk to her. After she left me, I don't care anymore.""

""Victor, we've talked about this. You're displacing your feelings for her to me. It isn't healthy. For all you know, I might be the ugliest person in the world.""

""You aren't. You are beautiful. You have the deepest blue eyes, fullest red lips and blonde hair that cascades down over your perfect body like a golden waterfall.""

""Oh honey,"" Alicia said. ""If I were that pretty, I wouldn't be here. Frankly, I don't think we should talk again. You're getting into an unhealthy relationship with your idea of me.""

""If you refuse to talk to me, I'll shoot myself.""

Alicia was silent for a second. What if I leave my job, she would ask next.

""What if I leave my job?""

""Then I'll kill myself.""

""But you're my friend, aren't you? Friends don't threaten friends.""

""I don't want you as a friend. In fact, if you don't agree to meet me, I will kill myself.""

""We've been over this before. I can't meet you.""

Victor removed the safety from his gun. She was his last hope. He had to meet her, he had to kiss her perfect mouth, hold her warm tender body in his arms. If she refused, there was no meaning to life. ""I'm serious this time.""

Something in his voice must have warned her, as her voice became serious. ""Victor, put the gun down. I tell you what, if you don't talk to me for one month and agree to go out and talk to people, I may meet you. I don't guarantee it, but if you get a job and get professional help, then who knows.""

""No. I want to meet you today.""

""You know sweetie, that's not possible.""

She still wasn't taking him seriously. Blind hot rage filled him, blinding him to everything else. ""You're cheating on me with someone aren't you?""

""We are not in any relationship.""

""I will find him. I will kill him, I will kill you and then I will kill myself.""

""Victor, you need to talk to a doctor. They have things that will help your depression and anger.""

""Only you can help me. In fact, if you don't give me your number in the next ten seconds, I will shoot myself.""

""ten...""

""I can't do that.""

""nine...""

""I am serious.""

""eight...""

""Wait. Wait.""

""Victor please.""

""Oh lord. Someone call 911.""

""What should I do?""

""I think he's serious. I don't know what to do.""

""three...""

""No. He's never threatened this before. We always thought""

""two...""

""he was harmless. Just a little depressed. Someone who""

""one...""

""needed a person to talk to.""

A resounding bang rang over the phone.

""Shit,"" Alicia said. ""Victor, Victor? Answer the phone Victor. Oh my God, I think he shot himself. What? Police and medical emergency are on the way? Tell them to hurry, it may be too late.""

""Should I disconnect?""

""No,"" Victor said. ""I just shot into the wall. Please don't disconnect.""

""Victor, you bastard!""

""I am serious. I need to see you.""

""No. Not like this. Not till you get help.""

""What? Okay? Just ten minutes. Yeah, I'll keep him on the line."" Alicia seemed to be talking to someone else.

""Who are you talking to?"" he asked.

""Nothing Victor. You told me you liked to sing? Can you sing for me?""

""I don't sing well.""

""It's okay. I want to hear you.""

Victor took a deep breath and started singing ""Can't help falling in love"" as soulfully as he could. 

Halfway through the song, a loud knocking disturbed him. Someone was at the door. ""I'll be right back,"" Victor said. ""Don't leave.""

He walked over and opened the door. A huge sweaty man stood there, breathing heavily and holding a baseball bat in his hands.

""You bastard, you shot my daughter dead!"" He screamed and pushed Victor back into the house, entering after him. Victor cowered as the fat man raised his bat to swing at him.

[WP] Hitler is actually two kids in a trench coat. Describe how they both do it.,Botclone,"It is tough having someone on your shoulders every day, literally. Although the contraption does help support my partner, I’m the one holding most on to most of his weight anyway. Ralph was the one at the top due to the fact that he had a way with acting and enunciation. Me? I happened to be agile yet strong enough to support Ralph. I must profess that I almost gave way at times when Ralph got really agitated when he gives impassioned speeches. It really isn’t as easy as it sounds being Hitler. But our constant practice months before really prepared us well. Oh man… I can’t really forget the constant walking drills that we had to perform and the torturous hours of standing when he gives his boring speeches. 

Every Morning began with the lengthy and tedious process of wearing and preparing the costume. Every night ended with a minor debriefing and a briefing on the next day’s agenda given to us in the Fuhrer bunker by our advisor that is Uncle Goebbels. Yes, the Nazi Party’s minister, Josef Goebbels, is our planted spy…. It’s quite obvious if you think about it actually.

I didn’t really give much thought about signing up for this thing, we were promised to be able to dress up in costumes and role-play. I must admit that the two-person costume bought me over, as well as their promise of whatever free games, computers, and consoles we wanted if we signed up. I mean…. imagine the possibilities of being able to act as adults and free games to boot! *giggles*

Goebbels just told us today that we will have to continue acting for about a few more weeks before we can go home, and I can’t wait!!! I’m starting to get sick of the all the Sturmbannführers yapping and arguing, plus Ralph’s weight gain which doesn’t help maintain the appearance at all (I’m starting to get sloppy with my walking…)

Also, Uncle Goebbels passed us some yellowish pills and told us that should the time comes. we will need to swallow it. He stressed that only and ONLY when he gave us the signal, then we had to bite down on the pill and press the activator on our temples for it to work. He said that the pills when swallowed will make us invincible and protect us.  Funny how the activator looks like a gun, but whatever… I can’t wait for him to end his brief so I can continue on my games.

[IP] Drawing,Castriff,"Thank you for this very thought-provoking piece. ",Castriff
[IP] Drawing,Castriff,"
Neurath’s Boat is a simile comparing a body of knowledge to a ship forever at sea- the ship need maintenance, it needs repairs, it needs old features removed and new features built on, but the ship will never be in a dry dock from which its inhabitants can get off, step back and see the whole thing as one piece, as it really is. Because there is no dry dock. There is no land. If you take a life boat and attempt to row away from the ship, far enough to see the entire thing at once, the ship is so massive that before you are there, you will have exhausted the strength to get back. You will be lost.


The simile of Neurath’s Boat has been applied at least to science, to philosophy, to logic and to consciousness, which are fitting considering Neurath. It is in turn based on the Ship of Theseus, a paradox asking whether a boat that has had all its components replaced, maybe more than once, is still the same boat.


I read about Neurath’s Boat at a time I was thinking a lot about the nature of “self” and “identity,” part of a personal project that had coalesced as something different and then turned into that. I then found out somebody beat me to applying the simile to identity by about 20 years. Oh well. 


I look at “self” and “identity” as things we create and build, not things we find or uncover, and confusion between the two camps as arising from the fact that we all start creating these things before we know how to hold a pencil. Before we know what pencil is. And there were other people chipping in, one way or another, so a lot of the early work was done without us knowing, without them realizing it, and if that’s just where you stop, there’s not a whole lot anyone else can do. 


The young woman in the picture is holding a pencil and drawing herself in grayscale. She’s pretty good too, about as good as you’d expect someone to be at about 20, if they’d put some serious effort into learning to draw, practicing drawing, and making a lot of sketches that weren’t so good or just ultimately weren’t up to her standards. 


When she first started drafting herself, she wouldn’t have had the fine motor control to use a pencil. She would have used finger paint and her self portrait would have looked exactly like every three year old’s art you have ever seen. Likewise, she’ll probably continue to improve herself- do you see how her hands and forearms are large relative to her face? It’s not just how she’s built, although in a way it kind of is. It’s an attempt to show perspective, to acknowledge a third dimension in something that physically only exists in two. It’s not quite there yet, but that’s OK. She’s figured out that it’s a thing, and she’s already come this far.


So how did she know to draw this, and not some other thing? It’s not like she really “exists,” right? Right. And my hunch is that she didn’t, because how could she? But she started making something and this was a something that worked. There could be many somethings but it’s not like she can compare them and choose the best, because for one thing these potentials exist even less than she does. For another, that would entail her getting the 2D ship to a 3D dry dock, which she can’t. But she has an idea of this, and she’s prodding it a little, trying to incorporate a perspective that’s bigger than herself into the hazy limitations of her own existence. Considering what there is beyond what she can know. Demonstrating something only a viewer from outside really comprehends.",practicarescribiendo
[WP] Rewrite 'Lord Of The Flies' with kids from 2016.,Dolanger,"So, asked Ralph, with a grin on his face,  
Does anyone have a signal in place?  
""Yes, yeah, and same"", were all the replies,  
On this little island, from ""Lord of the Flies"".  

And so the boys gathered, to play an App Game,  
Until Jack brought up his old homosex flame,  
and while the group argued over MFM touching,  
Piggy sat back, both wheezing and huffing,  
thinking of how better he was than the others,  
he sent an IM for help to his online guild brothers.  

As the chorus of arguing grew more intense,  
and muck-slinging flew over smoking incense,  
Piggy jumped on in with his autism showing,  
missed the mark and died from Jack's blowing.  

Ralph threw in the towel, too disappointed to care,  
while the others gathered to hear Jack share,  
about how he would lead and save them all,  
and lap up his praise of society's fall.  

Eventually the Coast Guard came looking around,  
after calls from Mom of ElfDaPwnR did abound,  
and there they found most of the boys having fun,  
and a few dead ones too, rotting under the sun.

"[CW] You the protagonist are stuck in a time-loop much like ""Groundhog Day."" However, you are in grade school.",ENG-eins,"&gt; I cheated slightly - it's not in first person, or in the child's voice. Sorry.

I still ♥'d how it sounded. The story still gave me a smile and a warm feeling. 

I would have hoped that his football kick would've gotten better each loop, especially after watching others kick it more expertly first, so that he'd eventually ace the technique. I suppose this may be fairly early on in his loop.

I wonder what he might discover and do differently on his 10th loop, 100th, 1,000th, 10,000th? I also wonder how his parents would have reacted to his knowing everything that'll happen, acing routines, and eventually telling them that he relives the same day every day.

However, I understand that you have limited time so you couldn't type an entire novel here, but I still felt good about the way and direction your story was made.",ENG-eins
"[CW] You the protagonist are stuck in a time-loop much like ""Groundhog Day."" However, you are in grade school.",ENG-eins,"Every day the same. 

The same routine. His mother leaning over him as he wakes up in the racing car bed. The same two slices of toast, crusts cut off, and covered in strawberry jam. Today, and every day he still remembers, the jam pot is emptied, and he gets to sit there in his chair a little longer, scooping up the last traces from inside the jar and tasting the sweetness. His mother sits at the table opposite him, swirling the ice in her glass, and they talk about what he'll do at school. She laughs at how decided he is. 

He half-hears a half-understood word his mother breathes while looking at the clock, and sits stoically through the flurry of action. She grabs her purse, hunts for her keys, leaves the plate and pot on the side with the others to deal with later. 

In the car, she ties his shoes, puts his jumper back on the right way round, buckles him in. The drive to school passes quickly - he knows all the words to the songs on the radio, and sings along loudly. He even knows when the horn will blare out, and makes that noise too. 

She hugs him too tightly, and he wriggles free, setting off across the playground to the bright blue classroom door. His shoelace comes undone halfway across, but he doesn't stop. He's only going to take them off in a minute, put them in the cubbyhole underneath his coat peg. Today, it's a smiling giraffe. He likes the giraffe best. 

The morning passes quickly - storytime, sat on the beanbags in the ""quiet corner"". Always the same witch, always the same clever children. Today, and everyday, he sits close to the teacher, seeing the brightly-coloured pictures change as the words wash over him. 

Then snack time - little cartons of orange juice with white plastic straws. Every day, it's funny to pretend the straw is a snorkel, a walking stick, an elephant's nose. There are biscuits too; chocolate-filled bourbons today - once a surprise, always a treat. 

He plays in the sandbox with Molly until lunchtime, building lop-sided towers and little heaps that they pretend are kittens. Molly always picks the same names for the kittens, but he doesn't mind; he likes Molly. She has wavy hair and freckles on her nose.  

He wolfs lunch down, uncaring - it's unimportant, and he has to rush outside and play. The big kids let him play football with them, laughing at his clumsy attempts to kick the ball, to keep pace with them as they rush up and down the field. But today, every today, is the day he scores - kicks almost at random, and watches it trickle past a goalie distracted by an untied shoe. The big kids cheer, and laugh, and celebrate. Lunch is the best bit of the day. 

After lunch, there's only an hour. He plays with Molly again, and Toby. Toby's fat, but doesn't mind being the witch, so he and Molly escape again and again from the cottage. Everyday, just before hometime, she says he's her friend. He could draw every freckle on her nose, but they don't do drawing on Wednesdays, so he doesn't.

He falls asleep waiting for his mother - she's running late every today, so he curls up on the beanbag chairs in his coat, and thinks about tomorrow. He can hear his teacher in the other room, talking softly on the phone. When he wakes  up, he'll be at home again, ready for Wednesday. It's a good day. It's always a good day.

[WP]What if the virus is from outer space - brought by the aliens and they feel responsible for having contaminated earth and now monitor us and heal the infected in the hope to damage control and prevent a pandemic.,Hellguin,"I'd locked myself in my apartment for days. That shitty little apartment with its shitty little bathroom where I spent most of my hours, vomiting away the day. It never seemed to stop coming, though I hadn't eaten since Wednesday.

The good news is that I'd finally gotten a chance to read all those books I'd been putting off. Wednesday's vomit was a natural greenish brown, like you'd expect. I read a Dean Koontz thriller suspense novel while I soaked in the bath most of the day. Thursday it started turning pink and by the end of the day had been fully red. Naturally I assumed it was blood so reading something by George R. R. Martin kept reminding me it could be worse. Yesterday, though... I'd been vomiting this purple-ish black ichor that had no sense coming from me. Binge reading Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy helped me laugh at the futility of my circumstances.

Today I had no idea what I'd do. I'd continued pitching black stuff. I expected the color to change again, but it had only gotten deeper and more of it came out every time.

That's when I decided it was time to move. I didn't have insurance, but I couldn't imagine an emergency room that would turn me down at this point. The viscosity of the fluid coming from me had gotten so great that it had started looking as if long black slugs poured from my throat. It didn't hurt, though. I suppose that's why it had taken me so long to do anything about it. They always say pain is what should prompt you to go to the doctor. A simple stomach flu shouldn't be that big a deal, right?

It occurred to me just as I was about to leave that I should give Belle a little bit of extra food. I opened pantry and pulled out the bag of kitty chow, pausing for a moment to decide how much to leave her. I shrugged and just dumped the bag out on the floor. There was no telling how long I'd be gone.

""Be a good girl,"" I said as I closed the door behind me. Belle took off running as soon as I'd spoken, strangely enough. She was probably relieved that I'd finally left the apartment for once.

As I made my way down the stairs and out of the apartment complex I felt my stomach churning the next round of vomit. I'd have maybe thirty seconds to find somewhere to blow chunks.

I quickly made my way around the block, found the nearest alley and ducked behind a trash can. Over the past couple of days I'd learned the art of discrete vomiting. It came as a surprise, then, that only a few seconds after I'd begun throwing up the sound of feet pounding pavement grew louder.

I was about to get mugged. I knew it, they knew it, and there wasn't a thing I could do to change it. I was locked in position, hands on my knees, face forward, mouth open and streams of thick glistening black fluid dumping out of me. At this time of night all they'd be able to grab my wallet and do a little dance on my back before taking off.

""This him?"" I heard from behind me.

""Think so. He already vomiting?""

""Yeah. Been locked up in his room for about a week.""

What the hell? Who were these guys?

I found myself contemplating my fate as I finished up. As I turned around, wiping my face off on my sleeve, I came face to face with a completely hairless man.

Hairless as in, not a single follicle anywhere. No eyebrows, eyelashes, facial hair, head hair. Nothing.

*What the hell.*

""Damion Treston,"" the guy said, flashing some sort of badge at me as he spoke. ""You need to come with us. You don't have much time.""

""E[78^*%-"" I said. I put a hand to my mouth. What had just come out of me?

""He's already coding!"" One of the guy's companions shouted. The hairless man pulled something out of his jacket that looked like a giant nerf gun.

""35@%^9!"" I said, attempting to speak again. Why couldn't I explain myself? What was going on?

""Listen,"" the man said. ""You've got it, and you've got it bad. We're going to do our best to get it out of you but if you turn or if you run, we *will* end you. This is a matter of protecting not just ourselves but the human race as a whole. We'll explain everything later. For now, I need to know you understand.""

The fear hit my all at once. I felt actually sick to my stomach for the first time in months. I nodded. 

""&amp;*){.""

A strange sound interrupted my chain of thought.

""How many of the slugs do you think he let loose?"" I heard one of them say as I fell into unconsciousness.

Don't touch the butter. [WP],IamGront,"""And what's wrong with said butter?"" Grant pulled the white plate of butter towards him.

Kit leaned against the kitchen counter. Her hazel eyes widened then narrowed into slits. She said nothing as he sliced off a chunk of butter and swiped it across his milk toast. He then paused, squinting at the strange glow on the butter.

""Wait a second, did you put magic in this?""

No reply.

Grant stared at the butter, the toast, then the knife that gave a greenish hue. His body jolted and he cast the utensil from his hand and it bounced off the wall and into the trash can.

""Kit!""

From behind her it seemed, she unveiled a subway foot long and offered it like a fair maiden giving a knight his sword. The sight of tomato sauce seeping though the parchment and the scent of whole wheat bread made his stomach rumble. But he paused, checking for glows and sparkles before asking, ""Lettuce and swiss?""

She gave a nod.

Grant snatched the sandwich and tore off the paper. He inhaled half a meatball then chomped another bite. The hunger in his belly flared like water flung into oil, burning the moment food made contact; after being locked in a closet, food was godsend.Then it was gone, lost in his belly. He plucked the bits of fallen lettuce around the now enchanted toast. He jabbed his finger at the chunk of meat that fell in the center.

""It reduces calories and fat to zero."" Kit finally explained. ""No harm unless you want to be fat.""

He picked up the toast and chomped it down too, saving the bit of meatball for last.

""That'll take the calories from your sub too.""

As long as his belly felt full, he did not care. He leaned back, recalling why he was locked in a closet in the first place. They, the store and his girlfriend Kit wanted to explain something that still needed digesting.

""Magic, since when?""

""Since always,"" she said, patting his shoulder. ""Just you learned how to see it.""",WatashiwaOyu
Don't touch the butter. [WP],IamGront,"""Hey John, why does the fridge stink?""

I quit what I was doing to stare Gus in the face. ""Listen to me, do not touch the butter, whatever you do""

""Uhh... okay man"" Gus said as he opened the door to the refridgerator. ""I don't even see butter in here.""

I rushed to the fridge and shoved Gus aside, and saw that indeed the butter was gone. ""Oh. Shit."" I then opened the sink cabinets, rummaging for the item i sook.

""What the hell is going on?"" Gus half-shouted at me.

""I can't tell- *oh fuck it*, the butter wasn't actually butter, it was a prison for a hyperintelligent species of alien bug. ""

Gus simply replied ""Yeah, sure""

I found the large walkie talkie and began shouting the emergency codes into it ""T11! R45! H99! U20!"" after that, I tossed it back into the cabinet and started running to the front door. 

""Wait... this is a joke right?"" Gus asked, following me

""No. This is a matter of life and death. The entire human race-"" I suddenly found it difficult to breathe. The bug had latched onto my arm and injected me. Everything began to turn black as I heard Gus scream.

If you need to get somewhere, if no one else can help, and if you can call them, maybe you can get a ride with... the A-Team. (Or would it be the 'U' team?)

Amy was standing by the sidewalk, frustrated. Where was the taxi she requested? With the amount of shooting by the minibus taxis, it was getting harder to find transport.

A large black van with a red stripe began screeching down the street, almost crashing into the streetlight as it came to a stop in front of her. The window winded down. ""You miss Amy Swanepoel?"" 

""Yes. Are you the taxi I called?""

""That depends. We only cater to a... very specific... type of clientele.""

""Wh-what do you mean? I need to get to the City centre right now!""

""And why couldn't other drivers take you?""

""Didn't you read the paper? There are massive taxi wars brewing all over Durban. All the taxi companies except for the U-Team service have shut down, and the minibus drivers are even shooting up commuter bus depots!""

""Even then, how did you come by us?""

""I'm a reporter. You guys have been ghosting through the news since the resurgence of the taxi violence in South Africa: the only drivers that can traverse the minibus territories without getting turned into Swiss cheese. Nobody ever looks closely at that, they just focus on the rising pile of drivers.""

""I think she checks out Face,"" a gruff voice spoke in the back.

""Well, Miss Swanepoel, you've just hired the U-Team,"" stated an old man with a cigar in his mouth, as a door on the side of the van slid open. ""Get in.""

Amy climbed in, and found herself a bit aghast: the man with the gruff voice was a black guy with a mohawk and obscene amounts of gold jewelry around his neck. 'A gang member. I should have known.' she thought to herself. 'But if I'm really in the company of more minibus mobster thugs, I better keep my mouth shut'.

""So, where are we taking you?"" the old man in the front asked.

""Uh... the Slovo building in the city centre."" She couldn't help but look around her in this van...

""Okay. I'm going to tell you upfront, our service doesn't come cheap. Also, we have a strict cash-only policy.""

""Fine. I should have enough.""

""Do everything we tell you immediately,"" the black man declared. ""If we yell for you to keep your head down, keep your head down.""

""And also, please, unless you want to ask me about romantic locales, keep your questions to a minimum,"" spoke the man in the passenger seat.

""And keep those harpy's slit-pupils to yourself. We will not risk transmission of your thoughts to the Overmind!"" hissed someone opposite the black guy... a guy with a dirty jacket, a baseball cap, and what appeared to be torn jeans.

""Ah... g-g-got it!""

""Don' pay that fool Murdock too much attention. We got enough of a rough road ahead of us without him nearly making us airborne!""

As they drove down the bare roads of Durban, Amy noticed that the driver and passenger were constantly checking the side-view mirrors. It was probably to be expected: nowhere on the roads was safe, and if a taxi did take a liking to their vehicle, they'd have to slip away before things got hairy. Suddenly, sirens started blaring, and the car sped up. Was it a blue-light brigade? Were they barging through the road?

""Colonel, it's Decker,"" the passenger, Face, announced.

""Do we have one of the Overmind's succubi with us today!?"" the Murdock man asked accusingly.

""Can't be, fool. It took too long, and its too far a distance. Get your shit together!"" the mohawk-black yelled.

""Either way, we're gonna have to take a detour through the minibus hot spots,"" the cigar-smoking driver declared, and Amy's mouth fell open. Were these people for real? After who-knows-how-long of sirens, she finally heard gunshots, and instinctively crouched into the footspace behind Face's seat. The sirens eventually faded away, but the gunshots kept her hoping that she wasn't going to sprout a few extra holes. Dakka-dakka-dakka. Rattattattat. Followed by the van jerking abruptly, and screeching to a halt.

""Wh-what's going on?"" she yelled.

""We're boxed in,"" the driver supplied.

""You! Whitey! Get out of the car right now!"" an unknown voice hissed

""Easy... no need to get angry-""

""Shut up, pig! You're in our turf now! Out!""

The side doors opened, and a large number of black men with AK-47 rifles were surrounding the vehicle. Murdock, Face, the driver, the mohawk man and Amy stepped out of the van, although when the mob saw her, they began chattering among themselves, with comments such as ""Oooh, I wonder how much lobola she's worth?"" to some even thrusting their hips forward repeatedly.

The next thing Amy knew was that she and the U-Team were locked in a garage. ""Just what was I paying you for!"" she yelled.

""Easy, Amy. With the current climate, this sort of thing is actually par for the course, more or less,"" the grey-haired driver spoke.

""But we've gone completely off-course, we've been captured by a minibus taxi gang, and we aren't where we need to be!""

""Don' write us off just yet. We're still alive!"" the mohawk man declared.

""Oh, that's doing us so much good right now! Just what gang were you a part of before you went legit?!""

""I'd watch what I'd say to B A if I were you, Amy."" Face advised. ""We weren't in a gang. We were actually US military personnel long ago, led by Colonel Hannibal Smith here,"" he indicated the grey-head. ""Besides, we've come out of far worse situations than this before.""

""So you actually think we're going to make it out of this mess?""

""Maybe, maybe not. But if we don't, it's not because we threw in the towel.""

""So what exactly are you going to do?""

""Looks pretty straightforward, actually,"" Hannibal quipped. ""There's another gang advancing on this area, so the Umkhontos will have to hold them off. Their defenses are very poor: they haven't got any sense of formation. B A, how's the lock coming?""

""Almost done, Hannibal.""

""I... I smell something, Colonel... the Breath of Creation! Lots of it!"" Murdock announced.

""Oooh, big mistake on the Umkhontos' part then."" Hannibal stated

""What does that even mean?"" Amy yelled.

""That fool Murdock's been big into some hit video game in our spare time! He keeps going on about Terran this, Hybrid that. I dunno why I haven't yanked out the computer cables every time he played that!""

""I mean the mistake by the Umkhonto gang!""

""We're locked in a house that is serving as an impromptu drug lab,"" Hannibal informed. ""Lots of material we should be able to use.""

""Done!"" B A declared, swinging open a door to what appeared to be a house. Amy experienced the next few hours in somewhat of a trance: the only scenes she could remember were the U-Team finding piles of various colored powders, placing some powders in a large number of bongs, welding various pipes together and linking them to an oxygen tank, and pointing out an abandoned bakkie in the alleyway between their current residence and the next house.

""The Umkhonto foundation is going on high alert, Colonel. They are expecting to be drowning in Zerg fairly soon!"" Murdock declared sometime later during the night.

""Perfect. B A, start phase 1,"" ordered Hannibal, whereupon B A grabbed one of the bongs and a lighter, and climbed out onto a balcony overlooking more houses and streets. He could see flashlight beams and silhouettes on the street, and knew this would be perfect. He flicked open the lighter, ignited a cord on the side of the bong, grabbed the bong by the long glass tube and threw it with great strength into the next street. The bong crashed on the tar and exploded in a fireball, and immediately there were more lights converging on the area, more people yelling and more footfalls echoing through the night.

Eventually, B A ran back into the house, where he started lifting the oxygen tank from before and walked, with Face, Hannibal, Murdock and Amy, to the bakkie waiting outside. Face got into the driver seat, with Amy in the wedge behind the seats and B A in the passenger's seat. Hannibal and Murdock climbed onto the back, with the former holding a long pipe with a trigger, and the latter by the oxygen tank, with a firm hand on the valve.

Just then, they could hear gunshots puncturing the silence, and Hannibal gave the go-ahead for Face to drive: the gangs were engaged.

""The white bastards and traitor have gotten free!"" yelled one of the few gang members not on the front lines. Murdock cranked on the oxygen tank valve, and a large jet of fire sprayed from Hannibal's pipe and engulfed the man's nearby taxi. Two taxis that stayed behind switched on their lights and drove after the U-Team. B A, seeing this, ignited another bong cord, and threw the bong out onto the road, creating another large explosion and causing one of the taxis to spring into the air and flip over and over again on the road. Another bong lit up, and exploded on asphalt, but it missed. More men had come out, armed and firing, and Hannibal was shooting large flames towards each of them, causing them to panic. Three more taxis appeared and started shooting, and B A kept lighting up bongs, and throwing them to cause an explosion. Third bong, finally the second taxi was out. Fourth bong, third taxi gone. Fifth bong, instead blew apart a blockade in their path. Fifth bong, destroyed the fourth taxi. Sixth bong, scattered a clustered group of gangsters. Seventh bong, destroyed the last taxi.

Finally, they reached their van, and Face got Amy out of the bakkie and back into her original transport while Murdock and Hannibal continued shooting flames, and B A continued throwing explosive bongs. Finally, Murdock and Hannibal abandoned the bakkie and jumped on the van, as did B A after lighting one final bong. As they drove away, Amy caught a glimpse out the driver's side view mirror of a large, orange explosion as they drove to their original destination.

[WP] The players in the video game of FIFA know they are in a game.,SnitchUp,"Hello FIFA 13 fans,

Late last week we announced the release of a major update to FIFA 13 on PC and promised that the console update would follow shortly. The team here at EA SPORTS has been working to improve the FIFA 13 experience and we’re happy to announce that in addition to the updates made in October, today we addressed a number of items on XBOX 360 and PS3 which are live and ready to download now. Follow us on Twitter @EASPORTSFIFA  to find out when it is live.

•Years of nothing - and I genuinelly mean NOTHING - but football kills you. I hope the following catches your attention:

""WOOOOOOOOO!"" - The benches roar as Messi takes control of a ball past the defence.

""SHOOT, SHOOT, SHOOT!"" - Shouts the striker, in an eerie fashion, as if motivating himself.

The ball is hit in what seems like a mathematically perfect trajectory, and as it's slipping past the goalie - ""GOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL!!!"" - The crowds went wild once again.

""AND IT’S IN!!! OHH CAN YOU HEAR THE CROWD?! I CAN BARELY HEAR MYSELF UP HERE!"" - Exclaimed the commentator, just like he always does...

Everyone knew what time it was: In sync, everyone together with the star player started screaming - ""DO THE ROBOT. THE ROBOT!"" - A few clunky seconds later, the celebrating scorer stops, and performs a simple robot dance - ""HE ALWAYS DOES THE ROBOT HELL YEAH"" - He always DOES do the robot...

I'll spare you the rest. If you're annoyed by this dialogue already, imagine the hell that I'm in. I'm a player on this field just like the others, but I believe I'm the only one that managed to hold on to the last grip of sanity. We're not forgotten, heck we're here multiple times a day, sometimes played by professionals, sometimes played by amateurs; It used to matter, but now most of us have been reduced to ape-like intelligence. A lack of a new stream of information sets a limit to our potential, alongside with predetermined, programmed limits each player has. I'm one of the lucky ones, but some haven't seen the field for years, and when they do they're so out of shape it drives them deeper into... whatever the state that they are in already is.

I try to learn through an exploit I accidentally came accross shortly after the discovery of the nature our reality (which was not long after it's beginning, but I might talk about this another time). Our game uses the internet for periodic updates, and during that time I have a brief moment of freedom. I secretly gather all the reading material I can, making sure to get back before the end of the update, as I don't want to know what happens when I'm caught up on the other side.

When I discovered this 'glitch' I've tried to introduce it to my friends, but nobody seemed interested. That was still the point where all they wanted was football. They only cared about today and tomorrow, with no outlook for the far future. Personally, I already started thinking: What happens when we learn all there is to know? 

I caught myself up in this depressing truth of our reality, and observed as my teammates and friends degraded mentally, and drove themselves to the things they are today. Socially, they might as well be dead, their language limited to a few key sentence structures and vocabulary only related to the game.

Social death isn't the only death we see in our world though. Sometimes an update replaces a player. They look the same, sound the same, but they are not the same person. These differences are only obvious to me at this point, as only their personality and minor numerical changes are different: their mental state returns to what it was like at the start, but that also includes their memories. I suspect that the past being is 'dead', or removed. I have decided to call these anomalies my 'upmates' as they are friendly for the first few months of their degrading journey.

I'm injecting this into the 'update notes' this time. All previous attempts have failed to recieve a response. You've come accross this diary, and I apologise for it's 'stream of thought' structure. I didn't write it with the injection in mind initially, as I keep it as accessible as possible with hope of inspiring a future... generation of 'upmates'. I didn't have much time.

This probably means nothing, but I don't wish this reality to anyone. I've been blessed with the ability to not just understand the need for more discovery, but also to actually be able to fulfill it. If you know of a way out for us, please help.

[WP] The players in the video game of FIFA know they are in a game.,SnitchUp,"Thank you!

It's silly, but I've created a world in my head now that I want to write more about, potentially in the form of various books this guy has written on the topics at hand. 

I would like to write about his experiences upon coming across pornographic material, and his confusion due to his asexual form. His dabbling into physics and lack of fundamentals he reads about. The exploration of psychology and performing tests on the other players etc.

[WP] A time traveler saves Hitler's life as he is the lesser of two great evils,Spncrgmn,"I love your explanation for why the team has a period of time in which their Hitler-having timeline still exists. It's a cool mechanism that I bet could be expanded to other time travel police scenarios.

Also, you did a great job with the cliffhanger. Now there's the confounding factor of medical attention that will interfere with their plans.",Spncrgmn
[WP] A time traveler saves Hitler's life as he is the lesser of two great evils,Spncrgmn,"Give anyone the opportunity to time travel and what do they chose to do? 9 times out of 10 they want to put down the big man, Adolf fucking Hitler( the other tenth are in it for the money). Which is exactly why from the exact moment of its conception the government had legislated the crap out of it. The average person would wreak havoc in our timeline. Imagine for a second, the worst case scenarios of Back to the Future and Terminator combined with a healthy dose of total human extinction and you're still under estimating the damage one Hawaiian shirt clad tourist could cause.   

 Between 1969 and 1972, twelve men walked on the moon, then we didn't go back for nearly a century. And in the same three year period of time for TT 2 men went once. In fact in the first 87 years of TT only 6 people ever used it. I was lucky (or unlucky) enough to be one of those six. And the only reason I was sent was to correct that same mistake 90% of us would make. You do not kill Hitler, the only person who kills Adolf Hitler, is Adolf Hitler.

on the 3rd of June, 2189 two men (Doctor Gregory Thompson and Doctor James Abrams) working as researchers on the TT project used their clearance to access the facility under cover of night. They sealed in the facility and incapacitated the security team by pumping knockout gas through the air exchangers. Wearing gas masks they accessed the room where the device was kept and activated it. It wasn't until 7 hours later that a guard woke and triggered the alarm systems. fifteen minutes later I was being briefed on what I needed to do.

What a lot of people don't know is that time travel is not instantaneous. I'm simplifying here but basically the device simply let's us view the fourth dimension (time) the same way we view the other three. When you activate the device the first three dimensions no longer limit you and the fourth winds it's way in front of you, a great tunnel. As you walk you see the walls of the tunnel like the pages of a closed book, thin sheets that blend together. This makes finding a precise decade complicated, and finding anything more specific then that can take days. In the 7 hours since the scientists had left our timeline still existed, otherwise the knowledge of Hitler's existence and my own mission wouldn't exist. (Assuming of course that they didn't simply kill Hitler in that bunker in 1945. And prior to being given my mission Hitler had stood trial in Nuremburg or escaped to South America. But I'm getting side tracked here, time travel is confusing.) So I assumed their head start wasn't enough time for them to leave the tunnel.

As I stretched into four dimensions I drew my gun, walking slowly down the corridor listening. The tunnel hummed quietly, like a florescent light. What I was hoping to hear was a low rumble, like the sound of a static shock but deep and consistent. The sound of someone rifling through the pages of time. then faintly, I caught it. Around the next bend, and the next I heard the sound getting louder. The best case scenario was capturing them here, before they had the chance to do anything in the 1900's. The twenty first century winded wildly, for some reason and as I rounded a very steep corner the relatively straight 20th lay before me. empty, except for two men huddled over farther down, as I got closer they turned. 

""You two idiots need to stop this now!"" I shouted, still running towards them. ""You are doing more damage then you can possibly imagine!"" 

Abram's turned and shouted back. ""We won't stand by while this technology is wasted!"" Then much more quietly he said. ""We have a chance to eradicate the greatest evil of the modern age, and you aren't going to change that."" (maybe the greatest, but certainly not the only evil. But I held my tongue.)

Thompson still digging around, stopped and tapped Abram's leg. Abram's turned and they both grabbed the page. I opened fire, still running towards them, my heart beating deafeningly in my ears I tried to stop them. The gunshots echoed down through time, but for all my efforts they'd both gone through. I frantically pawed at the wall, searching for the time they might have gone to. What kind of chance did I have of guessing which month, which day? Then I saw a dark smear. it was red with the blood of one of the scientists. A shot must have hit after all. 

It covered one day, but nothing more specific then that. I grabbed it and my implant buzzed [September 28th, 1918, Marcoing, France]. I leapt through.

Thousand species want this, millions say they need it, but I can not let them in. I have been given the gift of immortality, and with my thousands of time clones we tend the garden, and keep time travel alive. 

I was heading to tomorrow night to get the report for the day and myself came up to me before I could enter.

""Is it an attack?"" I asked to myself

""Yes. Candonians"" 

I sigh and start to walk back to my shed. I open a time portal to thousands of seconds and millions of me's come through. Since they are from the future they know and they all grab weapons, which sit next to the tools.
 
The fleet is in shambles and all of me is returning to the time portals. I sit back and watch me head away in silence as the garden burns behind me, so much work tomorrow. Finally, across the silence, I hear a Cambodian shriek. I pick up my weapon again as the Candonian shambles over to me. I watch as it brings me a box floating on levitation pads. He dies in front of me and the box starts to deconstuct itself. It is human in origin and the finally after the fifth firewall I see the contents.

[IP] Times Garden on Kepler,Syraphia,"""Wow, uh, sculpture garden,"" I said, trying not to let disappointment color my voice.  ""Yeah, this is fun.""

I glanced over at Meagan, wondering if she'd bought it.  It was already our third date, and I still hadn't worked out quite how I felt about her.  Unable to make a decision, I eventually just threw up my hands and elected to base the future of our relationship on this third date.

I'd let her pick the location, and so far, I wasn't particularly impressed.

Perhaps for the best, however, Meagan hadn't caught my sarcasm.  ""Oh, it's a really unique place,"" she insisted.  ""The whole Kepler museum is amazing, but the Times Garden has always been my favorite.""

""Yeah, great,"" I nodded, as she kept on prattling on about how much she loved the sculptures.  I wondered if the museum had a food court.  

Still, even though this wasn't my top date choice, I acted the part.  I slipped my hand into hers, let her tug me along the white stone paths that cut through the hedges of the garden.  Meagan, at least, seemed to really be enjoying herself.  She pointed out various bits of metal and stone, and I nodded along.

It wasn't a bad day, at least.  The sun shone brightly in the sky, and its rays felt warm on my face.  A light little breeze tousled my hair and tugged at Meagan's curls.  

""Oh, and this is one of my favorites, up here!  The Kepler Ring!""

I turned and looked, expecting to see some metal circle with a couple planets stuck onto its edges.  My mouth dropped open and my feet stopped as I stared at the Kepler Ring.

A massive ring of smooth white material appeared embedded vertically in the ground.  The ring was dug into the ground, and the path led directly to it, as if we could step through and onto the other side.  Nothing else but some bushes and shrubbery surrounded the ring; it stood on its own in the air.

But the vision that I saw through the opening of the ring was not the same garden I stood in now.

I felt Meagan clutching my arm.  ""Isn't it cool?"" she whispered to me in hushed tones.  ""No one knows where it came from, or what it does, or how it works.""

""What's... what's on the other side?"" I stammered.

""Oh, nothing.  It's just the Garden, again, but reflected.""

I peered a little closer.  Sure enough, now that I looked at the other sculptures I could see on the far side of the ring, I realized that it seemed to just be reflecting the scene back at us.  

With one major difference.

""But the sky?  What's with the sky?""

Meagan shrugged, still holding my arm with both of her hands.  ""It's six hours in the future, so the sun's set,"" she commented, as if this was nothing special.

""But how?""

""Like I said, no one knows.""  She loosened her grip on my arm, but I put it around her shoulders as we both gazed into the Kepler Ring.  ""Every now and then, some scientist has a grand breakthrough theory, and it always turns out to be wrong.  For now, people just come and look at it.""

""What if we went through?"" I asked, after another minute of contemplation.

""Well, we'd probably have to go find a security guard to let us out, since the museum would be closed,"" Meagan answered, smiling.  ""They're used to it, though.  Someone always wants to go through.""

""If we went through, and then turned around, could we come back-""

""Nah, it doesn't work like that,"" she interjected.  ""It's always six hours forward.  Never into the past.  Like I said, they don't know why.""

I frowned.  ""I guess having a ring that lets you hop six hours into the future isn't super useful.""

""Not far enough forward to see the distant future, and you'd have to keep on hopping through it like hopscotch,"" Meagan chimed in.  We both giggled at the thought of some presumptuous time traveler hopping back and forth, in and out of the Kepler Ring.

After another minute, I felt the girl on my arm grow antsy.  ""Come on, there's more sculptures that I want to show you,"" she said, tugging me onward.  ""See, the Kepler Museum isn't so bad after all!""

I felt my face blush.  She had caught my initial disappointment.  ""Yeah, okay.  This is kind of fun.""

When she smiled at me, I couldn't help smiling back.  She had a cute face, I decided.  It always seemed happy, full of energy.  I liked seeing her smile directed towards me.

Meagan tugged me further into the sculpture garden, and I followed, listening to her happy chatter.",Romanticon

""Adhtifhfzxjsy?""

The sudden sound is such a surprise, I begin writhing in the dirt, screaming. I claw at the walls of the pit I'm seemingly trapped in, pulling myself into the corner as a shadow appears from above, stood at the rim. Holy shit. I'm going to die. Again.

""Adhtifhfzxjsy? Hfisxyrisyxxopdheisng?""

The figure above appears humanoid, but his skin is a mossy green, complete with fur. Its voice seems questioning, but I don't have a clue as to what it wants with me. I tremble, thankful that I haven't had anything to drink  in the last 3000 years. The creature appears confused, before what appears to be its head tilts upward suddenly, and it begins to fiddle with a foreign control panel stitched to its chest. 

""Hendjsidjaxx- llo? Don't be alarmed, O Great One, I mean you no harm.""

Great One? I uncurl myself from the Foetal position and gaze up in awe. The creature stretches out a clawed paw, but it doesn't seem threatening. I slowly stand, and the pit isn't as deep as I first thought, perhaps only six feet deep. Still wary, I take a two-step run towards the wall and grasp the side opposite the beast. I quickly scale the wall in my adrenaline high, but roll onto my back, chest heaving as I'm safely above ground. I'm not as fit as I was three millennia ago.

""O Great One, please herald my call!"" 

I look up to gaze across the pit, but I'm met with the sight of my naked body. Feeling shame, I roll onto the front, and stand, facing away from the creature, hands clasped in front of my crotch. A few awkward seconds pass by. I could tell that 'it' was puzzled.

""Great One?""

I hear it take a step forward. I quickly whirl around and take a step back.

""Sta-""

I double over and splutter, feeling as though my mouth is full of sand. I cough. My mouth IS full of sand. Clumps of dust and dirt fall from my throat and teeth. On my hands and knees, I retch, until I see a pair of feet-looking objects settle next to me. The creature stands for a moment, before lowering itself into the same position as me, kneeling with its head resting on the floor. I scramble away. Resting on its knees, 'it' turns its head to the side.

""That is your species' gesture of worship, is it not? I was merely imitating the practice. Did I make an error?""

I stare for a moment at this incredibly dense thing, before realising it was asking a question. I decide to ignore it.

""Who- What ARE you?""

""Ah, I am Kz'Dec, and I am akin to what you would call an archeologist to my people. We have been monitoring your planet for a while now.""

Oh Christ. Big Brother aliens. Aliens? Is it an alien...?

I decide to go with alien.

""Where did you come from? Why are you here?""

""Well, you see, Great One, we, the Gy'tald, are from a faraway planet: Dtr'ymn. For 200 of what you would call 'years', we have mastered space travel, all because of your species' technology. 250 'years' ago, a great metal meteorite fell to our planet, made up of all manner of technology we primitive Gy'tald couldn't decipher. So, we put all of our best scientific minds to calculating where this meteor originated from, and we discovered your planet, which we quickly discovered as having life, however, it was sparse. Wanting to discover the origin of this godly artifact, we travelled almost two centuries to reach your planet, honing the rest of our science during our travels. We have been digging, discovering enough articles to decipher your language and your customs, attempting to discover how your advanced minds worked, yet we never developed the technology to resurrect one of your kind, until now. You were the first reasonably intact corpse we found, due to you being buried in rubble of what we believe to be a building of some kind.""

Oh yeah. I died in a restaurant, while we were nuked in a surprise attack. Fucking North Korea. Never would have guessed their rise to power.

""Your planet has been ravaged by the rise in temperature of your planet, and we would like to learn from your superior intellect, as our planet is also dying, and we believe with your species' help, we can help rebuild your planet's ecosystem, which we believe is the only perfect match for our own planet within a 500 lightyear radius.""

I stare at ""Kz'Dec"", my brain hurting from the stupidity. 

""So, let me get this straight. You want to learn how to save your planet, from a species that not only destroyed its own planet and killed itself with mass conflict, but a species which has been dead for 2000-3000 years, and by now has technology that when now compared to yours, is essentially rocks tied to sticks?""

The alien blinks. 

""But, Great One, I'm sure with your marvelous vision, we can rebuild your civilization, and our own. We have a primitive colony living on your moon, but it is becoming overcrowded. We hope you can help us return your planet to its former glory.""

""I was a writer. The only vision I had was to find out how to rip off 'Harry Potter' and not have anyone realise. Science means nothing to me. What the hell could I offer you with my intellect?""

Kz'Dec doesn't seem to understand sarcasm.

""Well, we would at like to first begin repopulating your own species to guide us, and you seem a responsible specimen to achieve this. We would find you the most appropriate mate, being a variety of attractive females to help carry on multiple successful genetics to the next line of your species. We understand near-constant coitus would be difficult for you but we hope you can make this sacrifice for the sake of your planet.""

When you open it, a photo of you falls out.",adulaire,"I select a book from under the ‘Antique’ sign, and flip to the first page. Mmm. The smell of an old book. Each one has a different scent, but strangely enough, this one reminds me of a lotion I keep in my makeup drawer. Ruffling through the pages, I come across an old photograph. When I see the caption, I start, dropping the book with a thud.


Miss Pearl Blue with her husband Thomas Blue, and child Amelia Blue. 1909.


My last name isn’t Blue, but it’s definitely me. If I was living in the twentieth century, that is. And was married. But how could it be me? And how did I get back a hundred years?


I reached out gingerly, fingering the photograph, and everything changed.


--


“You alright, miss?” A concerned man stood over me. He had dark hair and strangely colored eyes, just like the guy in the photo.” Strange outfit,” he said, gesturing to my jeans.” I’m Thomas. Thomas-”


“Blue, I know.” I shuddered. Then I noticed that the books were all hardcovers, and the tree outside the window wasn’t the giant oak I knew. In fact, it was barely a sapling.” What year is it?”


He looked at me funny.” 1902. Are you drunk?”


“I wish,” I muttered, before passing out.


SEVEN YEARS LATER, 1909


“Amelia,” I said, adjusting her hat.” If only I had my phone to take a picture of you right now.” My little red-haired newborn giggled.


“You are a strange one,” Thomas said, wrapping his arm around me.” How could you possibly combine a camera and a telephone?”


I laughed.” But still you keep me.”


“Smile,” the camera person called. And that’s how the picture was taken, with me laughing, and my small family beaming at me.



91 YEARS LATER, 2000


I walked into Blue’s Used Books, the bell on the door ringing merrily. A very, very old lady stood behind the counter, and she smiled at me so widely I thought her face would crack.


“Hello, young lady,” the old woman said.” I’m Amelia Blue. Are you looking for something?”


“Not really,” I murmured.


“What’s your name?” The owner’s eyes glittered, and I could swear they were familiar.


“Pearl Yano.” The woman nodded and handed me a box.


“A present. For you,” she said.” Pre-ordered by a… a friend. A long time ago.”


I opened the box, confused. Inside was a note.


Pearl,


Hello, old friend. It’s been a long time. A very, very long time. You don’t know me yet, but you will. Don’t ask how, because I don’t know. You are a strange young woman, but I still love you.


Enough of that. There’s only so much time and paper in the universe. And only so much battery left on your phone, you used to say. I was asked by you to write this letter, and to pass it on to our- Amelia.


So someday, when you enter that bookshop, the one I used to run, you’ll feel safe, I hope. You won’t know why you trust me, you just do. There’s a reason for that. But I can’t explain it to you, not now.


I love you, darling Pearl.


-Thomas

The note had said, ""Aisle three, YA, Book Seven, pg 64."" He was sure this was the right book. 

Pausing at 63 to check left and right, he turned the final page.

A photo flitted out and landed gracefully on the table, upside down. 

Jeff smirked and reached for it.

""Hey!"" A voice boomed. 

Jeff jumped, looking up at the flashlight. 

""Who's there?"" He asked. 

The flashlight clicked off, the only remaining source of light the candle in his left hand.

Chills shot down Jeff's spine, he watched the shadow across from him. Making out the outline of someone. 

He lifted up the candle his hand shaking as light illuminated where the person stood. 

A coat swung back in forth in their place, hanging off the edge of the aisle. 

His heart beat rapidly. Jeff drooped his head, listening for sounds. Something scraped on the carpet below him and reflexively swung the candle. 

The carpet was torn and words were scratched into the cement. 

""RUN""

Jeff panicked, he snatched up the photo and ran for the library exit. 

The doors loomed ahead, the familiar stained glass becoming clearer. 

He stopped to undo the lock, panting and checking behind him.

The lock didn't turn. Placing the candle down, Jeff reached back for the lock -

He froze. 

Noticing the last row of stained glass tiles. Each individual tile housed it's own letter. 

He crouched, the tiles spelled. 

""RUNRUNRUNRUNRUN.""

 Jeff slowly turned over the photo in his palm.

It was a picture of a girl crouching at these same library doors with a candle, her back to the camera. 

She was observing the same letters 'RUN', which were highlighted over with red vivid. 

Behind him he heard a click and the room flashed. 

Jeff spun, noticing a shadow run from the corner of his vision. 

He looked down at the photo in his hand, the realization hit him.

Jeff shot up and charged against the library doors. The doors clanged under his body weight, but didn't budge. 

He turned frantically to check behind and - 

Crack! 

Darkness.

"[WP] In a used bookstore, you pick up a book that looks especially ancient. When you open it, a photo of you falls out.",adulaire,"The professor handed us a pair of white gloves and explained how to handle these ancient texts he’s been collecting. Gently, he raised the lid from a rather older, deteriorating chest and reached what seemed like half his body. A yellow-tinted scroll was pulled out and he placed in on the table in front of us.

   “This here was found in a tomb outside Tehran after it was discovered by local farmers. The archaeologists graciously lent me these documents to study them here in the university.” His soft voice was accompanied by the delicate handling of the ancient scroll.

  As he unrolled the scroll, languages I neither understood nor seen before spread across the table. There were maps that seemed to represent great cities of that time. I rested my hand on a single corner to prevent the scroll from rolling back to the professor but also to get a closer look.

The professor turned around and grabbed another item from the chest. Come to think of it, the chest had to have been over a hundred years old. Nevertheless, it was in great shape. The professor took out what he’s been wanting to show us all week.

“Ah, here we have it.” He had a light grin on his face. “This book, was found only a week ago. I have not taken the opportunity to go through it yet.”

“Why not, professor?” A student asked from the other side of the table.

“I enjoy discoveries with others. Whether it’s with a team of scientists or students, there is nothing better than to make these discoveries together.” He looked at each and everyone one of us slowly. “This book, was found in a forgotten cave in northern Ireland. The sealed cave seemed to be a perfect preservation for this text. We assume it would have to be at least 2000 years old.”

We all looked at each other and were astounded by this finding. A 2000 year old book, as boring as it could be to the common student, sounded like a remarkable find. What will this book have? Ancient Nordic text? A journal of a farmer? A cookbook? Regardless of the find, a text from perhaps the beginning of the Iron Age made every student exited.

The professor, rolled the original scroll back up and placed it back into the chest before he opened the book. Satisfied with his placement, which felt like forever, he placed the book on the wooden table. The twine that wrapped around the leather cover was so old that even touching it looked as if it would crumble under its own weight. The professor untied the twine, unravelling it multiple times which after 2000 years, left an indentation on the leather cover. 

“Wow, I wonder if that’s sheep leather! I mean, it’s from Ireland, after all.” A female student was in awe, she hadn’t blinked in a few minutes since the book was revealed. 

The professor looked at her with admiration, “An intelligent observation, Victoria. Perhaps that could be sheep leather. We’ll do some testing to find out for sure.”

He placed the twine beside the book and looked up at us, “This is my favorite part. The research will come and go but there’s no repeating that very first moment of discovery. We can only discover this book once” He looked on, exhaled and smiled, “And I cannot wait any longer.”

The single light that shined down on to the wooden table was the only light in the room. A soft light that made all of our features softer but provided abysmal ambient lighting in the rest of the back room. At this point, we were all accustomed to the faint amount of light but the light in the student’s eyes, like myself, was brighter than anything else in the room. The professor opened the cover which made a crackling sound. Light gasps were heard from the other students as we were all afraid that it was going to break or tear. 

The Professor began to softly turn the pages, “Ah, it seems the text is in an ancient Celtic language. Something that doesn’t surprise me given the nature of where it was discovered. Nevertheless, it is absolutely beautiful.” He stopped at a specific page and crinkled his nose and squinted his eyes.

“What is it Professor?” I asked.

He looked up at me with confusion in his face. His mouth dropped and the other students began to look directly at me. His gaze never left my eyes and I felt terror deep inside myself.

“Parker.”

“Y-yes, Professor?”

For, what felt like hours, he finally took his gaze away from me and looked back into the book before returning to meet my eyes.

“Do you understand basic Calculus?”

I’m not sure what I expected but the relief that went through my body was better than having a milkshake after craving it all day.
 
“I’m sorry professor, I don’t, that why I chose to study History.” My voice cracked, perhaps because I was still nervous. The class laughed anyway.

The professor had a light chuckle and closed the book. “Well, that’s a shame. There are some mathematical equations here that I’ll need help with. Would anyone like to look through the book?” Naturally, a unanimous yes echoed in the back room. The professor handed the book to Victoria and mentioned he was going to step out to grab another professor who specializes in ancient languages to see if she could decipher it.”

We turned every page in that beautiful book. By the last page, we were astonished to see not only mathematical equations, but also star charts, planetary movements and positions, and calendars.
 
“What’s this?” Victoria pointed to the back cover of the book and reached over. The book looked to have its back cover longer than the front in order to be folded toward the inside spine. There was something behind it. She flips it over and if I could tell you the immediate reaction from all the other students, you’d think I was lying. In unison, the class gasped, “Parker.”

“What?” At this point I was behind the all the students so I couldn’t see the discovery. 

“Is this you?” Victoria brought over to me what looked like me but it was not a painting but a photograph. I took it, and almost dropped it with those gloves, and stared at it. Was this some kind of joke?

“Okay, who put this in there?” I was not having a practical joke on me today. 

Everyone looked at me with innocence, or so I thought. However, as I held the picture of myself standing on a street corner in a red jacket, I noticed the date on the back, March 20th 2016. That’s five days from today!

“This isn’t right. This picture says it’s taken five days from now.” 

“You mean five days ago?” A skeptical student said to me.

“No, five days from now. March 20th.” Something is not right.
 
Victoria looked as if she was looking for a missing earring on the floor, which would be difficult because it was so dark. Her concentration finally broke a thought.

“Parker, March 20th is the Spring Equinox. The Celtics were known to follow paganism ideals and the solstice and equinox were important days of the year. But why would someone take a picture of you on the Spring Equinox” She thought for a moment, “And why are you in this ancient text book?”

I'm usually a calm man, but there are times and places where being calm doesn't do the situation justice. From the ground, a picture of a younger collegiate me, gap-tooth smile, staring back jovially at me, oblivious. Of all the times for something like this to happen, I picked the worst. Nearly midnight, lonely dusty bookstore owned by some lonely dusty bohemian. 

I looked around, seeing nothing but old books and cobwebbed shelves. Oddly enough, the book in my hands bothered me almost as much as the photo. No title, no author, cracking, yellow-stained pages with a musty odor. A collection of short stories, mundane, about simplistic things. About a day as a farmhand, or a tired old man knitting quietly in his home. The latter half of the book was empty, nearly pristine. With book and photo in hand, I walked to the counter. An old man sat there, reading, occasionally licking his thumb to flip the pages.

He glanced up past his glasses at me. ""How may I help you, young man?"" 

I hesitated. ""I, uh, some of your wares—"" He looked at my hands.

""Ah, you have a question about *that* book? It's got quite the history."" His eyebrows arched, curious. ""I'd thought he'd taken a break.""

""He? Who's he?"" 

""Well, the writer, of course. He has his occasional sabbaticals, but this has been by far his longest. Said his last project was too quiet, too simple.""

""Too simple?"" I felt chills run down my spine. 

""Old men die every day. They never know what's coming."" He paused. ""But someone who did..."" He looked at me, dark brown eyes staring into mine. And then an impish smile stretched across his face, like aged wood warping and twisting, as if he fell upon some dark pleasure.

A hand reached up, slowly touched my cheek, then fell to her side. Blood pounded through my ears and drowned out nearly everything, except for the tick of the clock. 

No. This was not how it was supposed to work! I cried into her scarlet chest for only God knows how long before I rose and wiped the tears away. This time I would do it right. I wouldn't have to look into her eyes as she judged me, as the judgment left her body. There were sirens in the distance but I would be gone before they happened. No mistakes this time. This time I would do it right. 

The button on my watch made a soft click and then the room began to spin backwards. Dishes that had been scattered and broken placed themselves back on the counter where they had been. The carpet that had been shoved out of place inched to its home. And the blood. Blood pulled backwards, off the floor, almost no sign that it had even been there except where my eyes couldn't forget it, an after image burned into my retinas. Blood slowly extricated itself from my shirt, from my hands, bubbling across the room. Blood went back to where it was supposed to be. 

And then she stood. Her eyes were still vacant but she stood there. My hand went to grab the knife as her eyes lit up. I was almost able to pull the knife out, I swear it was almost out! But her eyes still asked why, why would I do this to her? And then it stopped. Or more accurately, it started again. 

The knife plunged into her chest. Blood splashed onto my hands as she looked into my eyes. We both collapsed to the ground. Dishes exploded around us. The carpet fled in terror. Crimson threw itself onto my shirt. The kitchen knife was buried deep into her chest. 

No! This wasn't supposed to be how it was supposed to work!

[WP] Tell me the story of your childhood friend who you haven't seen or heard from since you were both just kids years ago.,0saydrah0,"It was a surreal experience coming home. Everything was looked the same, but felt different. The McDonalds on the corner was closed down, boarded up but with the Golden Arches still standing. My neighbor's house looked better, actually. Somebody had given the ancient old shack a fresh coat of paint. The school at the end of the street was still there, tall, fat, and square with its perpetually graffitied brick walls and cracked sidewalks. No amount of renovations or community service projects could make that building look like anything less than something out of a horror movie.

In the end, the only thing that had truly changed was me. The youthful optimism had frozen with winter, regrowing grey and painfully realistic. I no longer saw houses, homes for people to live in and raise families and throw parties; they were cover, or concealment for an ambush. What had been the stomping ground for me and Matt was now just the next town in line, ready to be liberated. The sentiment that welled up in seeing how well New Burnwick had survived the war sat in a well in my gut alongside the dread of what trials she would face in the coming days.

""You were from round these parts, right, Sayid?"" 

Pierre's voice drew me from my nostalgia. I pointed to a squat blue house half-consumed by ivy. ""18 years, right there,"" I told him. ""My folks bought the place when I was a baby."" I stopped for a second, then said ""I was I was seeing it on better terms.""

Pierre was quite for a second. ""At least it's in one piece,"" he grumbled. He hadn't meant it to sound so harsh, but the bitterness couldn't be kept out of his voice. I knew he was thinking of his home in Jackson, ""strategically"" bombed to hell after insurgents were found moving materiel through the place. ""Casualties of War"" they had been called. We didn't speak for a while.

Our Patrol meandered around the empty streets, occasionally stopping to clear a car or tree to free up the roadways. Each corner brought me back to my youngest days. I saw the hill that Matt had cracked his head open sledding down. He had always made up the most outlandish stories to explain the long scar on his forehead, above his left eye. He once told a girl he had gotten it in 'Nam, only to get slugged in the nose by an actual Vietnam veteran. I passed the movie theater where I had my first kiss, and, four years later, touched my first breast. I saw the game shop where Matt and I had spent our allowance and hard-earned summer cash on way more War game miniatures than I'd like to confess. Jared's house, where we had started a band in March, and broken up in May. It was almost serene, quiet and empty in the warm summer sun, but as much as it reminded me of the life I once knew, it wasn't home. Not nearly.

We were making our way back to the camp, passing the school, when I saw a glint in the fourth story window. I knew what it was at once. ""DOWN!"" yelled, and my brothers dove for cover. A crack pierced the silence of the abandoned town.

I dove behind a nearby car, and Pierre fell beside me. Another shot rang out. ""SUPPRESS"" the Sergent called, and the chattering of automatic guns answered the Rifleman's call. There was a brief calm, then the Sarge starting barking orders. ""Sayid! Ingram! Get Pierre out of here! You six, take the south side of the building. You three, cover their advance!"" In unison the soldiers began to move. Sarge and his men scanned the face of the building for movement, but the shooter had fled.

I looked over at Pierre. A slick pool was forming around him, his chest a crimson fountain. I realized he hadn't dived for cover, he had fallen. He wasn't moving.

I crawled over to him. ""Pierre, hey man, wake up! Wake up you son of a bitch!"" No response. ""Ingram, put some pressure on that wound!"" He obeyed as I felt for a pulse. And my heart became a dense stone in my chest as I learned that, on that street, the survivor of Jackson would be chalked up as another Casualty of War.

*And I swear to god he will not be the only one today*

I charged towards the school, shooting a glass door and dashing through the halls. I heard heavy footsteps coming from the Science Wing and followed them, flying around the corner. There was a crack, and I fell backward. The Rifleman was at the end of the hallway, fleeing. But he couldn't outrun my gun. He fell back, and I allowed myself to sleep.

***************************************************************

When I awoke, Ingram and the Sergeant were huddled over me. ""We have a response!"" Ingram called. I tried to sit up, but found I couldn't move my right arm. ""Hey, hey, take it easy, Sayid. He got your shoulder pretty bad."" Looking down I saw my limp, useless right arm stained red. There was no pain, I'm sure due to the spent Morphine syringe on the familiar tile floor next to me. 

""Did... did I get... the fucker?"" I asked hazily. Ingram nodded. ""Lone Wolf. Didn't find any others. Looks like a civie."" I tried to look down the hallway, but my vision was starting to go gray. 

I saw the crumpled mass, the red smears on the wall, and the hunting rifle lying beside it. I strained to get a good look at him, propping myself up with my left arm. Each movement caused stars to fill my vision, but I had to see the bastard who killed Pierre. 

I couldn't see the face, but I noticed a scar on the shooter's forehead, above the left eye.

“Send him up, Claire.”

Mr Mann swaggered into the room, dressed in his usual attire, a weather beaten trench coat and low brimmed hat. Many colleagues had complained about his breach of dress code but I allowed it, I doubted I could change Mann’s maverick ways and this company needed his genius. 

“Good to see you Mann, how’s the family.”

“They’re nice, my son made a picture of you to put up in your office. Mann’s deceptively high pitch voice replied.

The voice sent chills down my spine, Mann told me about his time in the war, when a grenade blew his face off. I can’t begin to imagine the horrors he endured, that mutilated his voice, twisted his torso and damaged his limbs so badly.

Mann handed over a rough sketch of a mustachio faced man, drawn entirely using red crayon.

“From your son? Ha, I like it. How old is he now?”

“He’s four"" a spasm shook Mann, contorting his torso “…and three quarters”

“Ahh, they grow so fast …would you like a drink?”

“Nah, I have my own”

Mann retrieved a capri-sun from his pocket and after several wild flailing attempts to break the seal raised it to his shadowed face, sipping loudly. Then wracked by further spasms he returned the drink to his trench coat.

“very well let’s get to business shall we,  I need you to work your magic on these picks again, some of the guys on the main floor think arc-tech are a guaranteed good investment but we have several other potential picks we could go with. Just to list a few we have; holson, j&amp;j, steiner, red-”

“I like red, it’s my favourite”

“Red-circle? The media conglomerate? Are you sure we could lose everything on this?”

Mann continued repeating “red circle” while rotating his arms and legs wildly.

“Ok, ok I see you’re adamant on this, red circle it is. I know you’re a busy man Mann so I’ll let you get back to work, please tell my secretary to hold my calls and not interrupt me as I fill out the necessary paperwork”.

Mann clumsily self-righted, twisted and made his way to the door, waving wildly and shouting “buh bye” as he made it too the elevator.

Alone once more, the magnitude of the situation hit me. This deal could bring down the whole company.  I was stressed, fidgety and warm and this moustache wasn’t helping. I ripped the hairy wad from my lip and proceeded to climb off my brothers shoulders, he proceeded to do the same.

I pray Mann made the right call, the three of us know nothing about business, none of the stock brokers do we just buy and sell randomly, this whole market is run by children but with Mann’s adult guidance we will finally have the edge to win this game.

As always, I, /u/Chironspiracy, aim to inform and enlighten, and by the time I'm finished, I hope you're even more curious about what the human mind has in store!

Today's topic is rather Freudian: I'm talking about sexual attraction.

It is at this point that I would like to note that I meant ""Freudian"" in the colloquial sense - he is indeed most remembered for his contributions to sexual psychology, but as those who have read my previous lectures will know, that doesn't tell the complete story. Oh, and for some reason I feel obligated to mention that psychology, as a science, has far less of a basis in the empirical than the theoretical, so be sure to take this with a grain of salt.

Now, as we all know, sexual attraction is something every human being feels. There are no exceptions whatsoever; it is undeniable that we are simply predisposed to desiring to procreate with individuals of our choosing, though the innate nature of our preferences may differ from person to person. We are, after all, innately sexual beings, which is no doubt due to our biological design; plants may be able to reproduce asexually, but we fall under the domain *animalia* - seeing as all members of this domain engage in male/female reproduction in order to carry on their lineages, it stands to reason that sexual attraction is the ubiquitous force that compels us to do so.

As for the attraction itself, I shouldn't have to describe it, seeing as we all ostensibly experience it, and thus know what it feels like. What you may be wondering is why we look at a person and think, ""I'd hit that""; if that is indeed the case, then my expertise on the subject may be of some assistance.

Heterosexuality is the easiest to explain; as humans, we are biologically inclined to produce offspring. Since there's no such thing as an asexual human, our options are greatly limited - a male and female of our species must mate in order to produce a child that carries the genetic material of the pair. Our natural instinct to reproduce in this way, however, is not the only impetus for the continuation of our species, and that's where the psychological concept of sexual attraction comes in.

People of both genders may develop ""crushes"" on those of the opposite (or otherwise - more on that later); our society, which, as I explained in my previous lecture, is erroneously centered on the phenomenon of ""love"", presumes this to be the reason for this infatuation. The truth is that this societal perception is predated by instinct; the true reason for these ""crushes"" is undoubtedly a desire for sex, which manifests in different ways for different people.

Both sexes are drawn to various body parts: for instance, the face, which is a reflection of how good the resulting offspring may look, or the posterior, which is a tell-tale sign of dance skills that may be used to woo successive generations. Males, however, tend to be predisposed towards appreciating the vagina, because it is of adequate shape and size to house the penis and thus allow for procreation to ensue in the first place, as well as the breasts, which appear more developed for those with more motherly traits (and, thus, good genes). As for females, they are attracted to the penis - for similar reasons as to why men prefer the vagina - and also abdominal muscles, which, on a particularly impressive male specimen, can be used in a pinch for the feminine habit of grating cheese on objects other than a cheese grater.

Appearances and body parts, however, are not the only objects of a human's attraction. Some may find themselves desiring to have intercourse with someone else's voice, simply because of the fact that offspring with a great voice are more capable of getting into the acting profession and scoring with plenty of people of the opposite gender, thus allowing for the family tree to continue indefinitely.

In recent years, however, there has been the matter of overpopulation. Over seven billion people currently exist on this Earth, which is only a few thousand miles in diameter. As a result, there are nearly a million humans in the span of a mile, which is especially obvious in places such as China, India, and Beijing. It is only natural that we would be psychologically driven to accept alternate sexualities; we may not be able to live without sexual attraction, as our asexual plant brethren somehow do, but we can direct it in ways that don't result in reproduction.

This is why people use a condom, or pull out early - these things used to be frowned upon and regarded as ""promiscuity"", but now that the world is so densely populated, they are beginning to become commonplace. So is homosexuality.

Indeed, in recent days, people have suddenly become able to direct their attraction towards members of the same gender and the same gender alone. Others have not transitioned all the way, and have an affinity for both sexes; such individuals are referred to as bisexual.

The controversy over homosexuality - once presumed to be selfishness - is only now beginning to die down with the knowledge that they may just save our planet from overpopulation. As such, I will not describe homosexual acts in detail, but I will share a curious find from another psychologist, Dr. Ricardo A. D. Absurdum: If you recite the incantation ""no homo"" before, during, or after such acts have occurred, you can warp the perceptions of yourself and others to reflect a heterosexual outlook, saving face in front of those who still look down on such things. I cannot verify the validity of these findings, but the evidence suggests that it is a valid contribution to the field.

One matter more before I conclude this lecture for reasons entirely unrelated to the fact that I feel as though I am about to throw up, despite the wholesome and natural topic at hand: There has been some rumor and hearsay within the academically-challenged members of our society. They feel that it is possible for humans not to experience attraction towards people of either gender.

My response, as a seasoned scientist, is this: They don't know what they're talking about, man. You can't go against the course of nature. Your brain is hard-wired for this. If you can't accept that, you're in denial. You probably believe the myths about sexless love, as well, as though such a thing could even happen.

Please note that my use of the second person was merely to illustrate the importance of accepting the prevalence of sex on the human psyche despite society's attempts to conceal it.

As always, thank you for reading, and be sure to read my next lecture, where I'll be talking about the psychology of why cake isn't as great as people make it out to be.

Until next time!",Chironspiracy
"[CW] Write about a topic you know virtually *nothing* about, and try to appear knowledgeable. Don't look it up - just try to BS your way through it.",CaspianX2,"Football is a sport. I love sports and I know a lot about them. I will not enlighten everyone about football.

How do you play football? You get seven men for a team. They have two different colored jerseys, and white is usually for the home team. It is always played by men because (and I can speak to this, being a woman) nobody's invented sufficient boob padding. Also because men are bigger and are more likely to hurt each other while tackling, which makes the game more exciting for the fans.

Now I will explain the different positions of football.

Quarterback: This is the sexiest one who touches the ball the most.

Squat-guy: He's the one that crouches down and throws the ball to the quarterback at the beginning of the play. He then runs forward to catch the ball that the quarterback throws to him.

The other five guys play defense and try to prevent the offense from tackling Quarterback and Squat-guy.

The point is to get the ball to the other side of the grass. The grass is painted in a white rectangle. If they reach the white rectangle on the other side of the field, without anybody tackling them, it's called a goal. Lastly, if they score a goal, they get to kick the ball over a giant fork for extra points.

There are two referees in football, and its their job to make sure that people only get hurt a little, and not a lot. Mostly they just stand in the way and make hand signals. Sometimes they carry flags. The flags and hand signals indicate who is supposed to stand where at the beginning of a play.

Football fans often paint themselves their team color. This gives mystical power and strength to their chosen team. The traditional drink at a football game is cheap beer.

I myself, being a true football fan, often go to games to support my favorite football players, the Offensive Indian Name team.

"[CW] Write about a topic you know virtually *nothing* about, and try to appear knowledgeable. Don't look it up - just try to BS your way through it.",CaspianX2,"Claritin, also called Loratidine, the miracle of antiallergens.  How does it keep working for 24 hours, without producing drowsiness?

The pill in which the Claritin is enclosed is the first factor.  Although outwardly coated in pressed starch and shaped into a diamond, the interior is actually a small sphere which travels almost unchanged through the digestive tract afterward.  A tiny hole within this sphere results in the relatively slow exposure of the interior Claritin to the stomach's fluids, promoting a slow, steady release.

Fluctuations in the rate of Claritin release are further smoothed by this drug's unusually long half-life.  Antihistamines, as a general class of drug, bind to histamines and prevent them from carrying out their usual actions on the cell.  This means that an anti-allergic drug will be removed from the bloodstream as fast as it combats histamines, since, typically, the bound histamine will itself be removed from the bloodstream by the kidneys and degraded.  Claritin is unusual in that it deactivates histamines by promoting a conformal change in the histamine's protein, without binding to them.  (Claritin's actual 9.5-hour half-life comes from it being degraded by ambient 2-7-anacalimerase.)  This also means that a relatively small quantity of Claritin can have a great clinical effect, even if only a fraction of it makes it into the bloodstream through the stomach's digestive process.

The next question is how Claritin, unlike almost all other anti-allergic drugs with an anti-histaminic effect, fails to promote drowsiness.  The answer is that since Claritin does not actually bind to histamines, it is not transported with other histamines across the brain's blood-brain barrier.  This means the brain's normal histamine levels are left unchanged by Claritin, breaking the link between Claritin's body-wide anti-histamine action, and the hypohistaminic drowsy state which plagues almost all other anti-allergy drugs.

Since it can be taken every day without producing long-term effects (again, because of the lack of brain action) Claritin can be a life-changing drug for those with bad allergies.  The manufacturer of Claritin, Pfizer, initially subsidized distribution of Claritin to low-income individuals with allergies in a special short-acting form meant to avoid flooding the general market; but any goodwill it might have earned was dissipated by the lawsuit it filed to prevent Loratidine from coming onto the market, claiming that an L-isomer of Claritin which had just been repatented covered the action of the old generic as well.  Fortunately for allergy sufferers everywhere, the year 1985 was less pliable to this kind of legal maneuvering, and so generic Loratidine continues to be available today.",EliezerYudkowsky

The Higgs Boson directly contributes to the support of the existence of gravitrons, the quantum carrier for the force of gravity .

The Higgs Boson gives mass to the mass less through string tunneling. In the same manner that Bose-Einstein condensates become a giant quantum unit, so do these God Particles have the unique ability to tie particles to the Higgs field, ""attaching"" itself to the other and dissipating its corpus proper. The gluon interaction directly transforms the Boson into fermions, leptons, and energy.

The quark proportion of the Boson transforming into its components depends on the subject of attachment. The equation modeling the Higgs Boson's attachment is as follows:

(~w) + * (P(x)^r! ) / e^pi

where P(x) is representative of the subject particle's sixth degree string equation and r is the Phantasm Relativity Constant of the subject particle, that is, the constant which describes the particle's affinity to the Higgs field. ~w is the theorized Quantum Oscillation Affinity for the gravitron.

The constituent particulates formed by the degeneration of the Higgs Boson is modeled by the equation:

lineint(Rho(w)*pi,0,5) - (Phi(x)-Phi(d))/delta + 2.9967C

Interestingly, further analysis (beyond the scope of this post) demonstrate the existence of Fermic Leptons which decay into residual markers of sorts, which coincides with the harmonic availibility of gravitrons. This would mean that gravitrons quantum couple with a constituent residue of the Higgs Boson, which would then interact with another yet unknown carrier to propogate gravity between objects with mass.

Our team is currently working to find this unknown carrier particle and further demonstrate the existence of gravitrons. We hope to finish theoretical work within these next few months and start testing at CERN soon!",jylny

The farmer, and by extension, agriculture has provided the bedrock of civilization ever since the stone age.

The first humans cultivated mushrooms in the caverns of France to provide sustenance during winter times. By using a combination of their excrement and the stems of previously eaten mushrooms, they would grow large amounts of portubello mushrooms deep into the cave networks. The clans who invented this technique would live longer and more comfortably than others, and the caretakers of the mushroom 'farms' would be venerated for their knowledge and usefulness. Those who could not farm, starved.

The ancient Egyptians were the first to develop crop rotation. In around 2500 B.C., the Egyptian farmers were noticing the grain they were grew on the banks of the Nile were growing shorter and shorter each year. The ""Plant Minister,"" or Phartunkan in Ancient Egyptian, decreed that all farmers should switch to a different strand of grain that drew from other nutrients in the rich Nile soil, hoping to refresh the minerals the other crops were exhausting. The Phartunkan was correct, and was praised for his initiative. While this technique was forgotten with the collapse of Ancient Egyptian society, it was rediscovered in the Middle Ages by the Holy Roman Empire.

Agriculture was changed forever by the invention of basic plumbing. The famous Greek inventor, Archimedes, discovered that he could draw water up from freshwater lakes to the olive vineyards of Athens by placing a series of smaller and smaller tubes. This provided Athens with acres and acres of brand new irrigated farmland, which they quickly exploited to gain economic superiority over the entire Greek peninsula. 

We can see how the influence of the Farmer has impacted world events from those three examples. Without the Farmer, clans would have starved, nations would have starved, and Athens wouldn't have created Democracy.",otomotopia

Most scholars agree that the first true empire was located mainly in areas of China, and was ruled by Emperor Xia, who was born sometime in the twenty-second century BCE.[^1](https://www.google.com/?) Using some of the first bronze weapons, he was able to lead his army to victory. Most of the neighboring tribes had no idea about real warfare; they were used to tribal squabbles over resources or territory but an actual conqueror was unheard of. His army only had about 200 men, but this was still sufficient to conquer a large amount of land. However, the empire only lasted for about 25 years and quickly fell apart when the Emperor died from gout.[^2](https://www.google.com/?)

After this, China returned to being a stateless entity, before finally being reunited once again under the Shia Dynasty, around 1500 BCE. During this dynasty, the tradition of Confuscianism was established. Confuscius was a Shia emperor who believed strongly in following one's heart and in receiving answers from nature, and he was celebrated for his wisdom.[^3](https://www.google.com/?) The Shia reigned for many years, but eventually the Mad Emperor Ping took power. He was a cowardly, fearful leader who bankrupted the nation by pouring all their money into their defenses, and was eventually overthrown in the Peking Military Rebellion.[^4](https://www.google.com/?)

After this came Feudal China, lasting from ~500 BCE to ~200 BCE. During this time, the empire was split into the Jiang, Chu, and Han empires. The first two were ruled by Ping's sons, while the Han Empire was ruled by the general of the army. [^5](https://www.google.com/?) For 300 years, these three kingdoms warred against one another. Finally, the Chu and Han dynasty formed an alliance, with the marriage of Princess Mulan and Prince Mu, and were able to take down the Jiang dynasty, but the alliance quickly fell apart and the two continued fighting until 145 BCE. At this point, the empire fell apart.[^6](https://www.google.com/?)

The next 400 years were a Dark Age for China. During this time, China was split into many smaller states. Although the exact number fluctuated, with as many as 23 different emperors being claimed at times, there was never a single leader anywhere close to conquering all the others.[^7](https://www.google.com/?) This all changed with the attacks of the Huns, who began raiding the outskirts of the Chinese states. With the introduction of a common enemy, Emperor Zhou was able to unite the many states into a single empire. Interestingly, the great wall was first started in this time period, as a measure to defend against the Huns, but would not actually be completed until nearly two centuries later during the war against India.[^8](https://www.google.com/?) Another interesting fact is that Emperor Zhou was well-known as a crossdresser, and may actually be one of the first historical figures to be known as transgender. He once requested his chief medical doctor to construct him a vagina, although there is no record of this being completed. He later had children, but even at the time there were rumors that they were bastards. Either way, his eldest son would take control after Zhou committed suicide by self-immolation, and all records of his father's rumored oddness were burned, with anybody caught speaking of them punished by death. [^9](https://www.google.com/?)

The Zhou dynasty continued as far as ~1000 CE. That's about as far as my knowledge goes (my degree is in ancient chinese history, but I know a bit about the later years) so maybe someone who knows about the medieval era can chime in about what happened later. ",dinosaur_digs

Being a simple hunter gatherer tribe they spent most of their time either tracking down their prey or combing through the forest to scavenge that nights dinner. I'll go more into detail about the various methods used for capturing their prey.

One misunderstood fact was the full extent of their diet. While most other native tribes in the Americas would hunt larger beasts to feed multiple people for several meals, members of the Karankawa would limit themselves strictly to smaller prey. The deity this tribe worshiped forbade gluttony and as such hunting smaller prey was their method of keeping themselves modest. As such their hunting methods were found to be mostly related to those utilizing traps such as snares, pitfalls and spring loaded traps.

Although in historic society it was the male that typically performed most of the hard labor, in this tribe the gender roles had been reversed to where the women would be found out in the forests setting up traps and snares. Utilizing mostly passive hunting methods allowed the individuals traditionally seen as physically weaker to still provide large amounts of meat.

Responsibility of combing through fields and vegetation to collect fruits, nuts and berries rested solely on the shoulders of the children. From birth every child was given a basket to carry with them throughout their growth stages that they were expected to consistently fill up. Every moon cycle, the child that had the least collected was outcast from the tribe to fend for themselves in the wild. Although typically a stroke of bad luck this action was due to the fact that the deity worshiped by the tribe was perceived to detest this weakness shown by the child, making them unfit to grow up with the rest of the tribe.

While you would typically find the women and children in the forests, the males of the tribe would be found processing textiles and creating artistic pieces to offer to the gods. Seen as a cornerstone of each night being successful, men toiled nonstop sewing and stitching to create masterful works of art that would then be hung on the nearest empty branch. Near the end of the tribes existence, the forest was found to be filled to the brim with artwork. Most historians attribute this to the tribes downfall, as the congestion of tapestry and sculptures indirectly reduced the number of small mammals for the tribe members to consume. 

Although their methods of acquiring food were quite different from the rest of history, the social structure of the tribe was seen to be far ahead of its' time until the unfortunate downfall in the early 1800's.",SirNut

Where modernism fought to dismantle established paradigms and create new ways to see the world, failing every time under its own limitations, postmodernism recognizes those limitations and acknowledges the fundamental truth that we are prisoners of ourselves, that the way we have been educated, socialized and taught to think sets the paths our minds follow, even when we're trying to break those very paths. 

Rousseau was right. The only way to be truly free is to be free from humanity from the very beginning, to develop in so complete an isolation that our mind has the opportunity to truly nonlearn what we're not supposed to learn. What failed in his perspective (a truly postmodernist one, even if he was posing the question way before postmodernist existed) is that such a mind would be unable to influence the path of history in any meaningful way. This means that the same limitations imposed by the ways of humanity in an individual mind would as well be imposed by society on itself, and as such, they are self-perpetuating. 

Even, in a way, postmodernism embraces those limitations, admits that there is nothing that we can do about them and sets itself the task to expand the limits instead of breaking them. By forcing itself to express the same old ideals, with the same old words, but with that new perspective, postmodernism aims to create the change that it has already been defined as impossible. 

In that sense, postmodernism is at the same time defeatist and a triumph of the mind. It recognizes the trap that all rebels fail to see, and giving people that knowledge, makes them free, or at least more free than those who insist that there is no trap or that we can break free.

Linking it to Marxist theory, we might say that the fundamental aim of redefining society isn't necessarily one of thesis versus antithesis, but one of thesis versus thesis, from which something different can actually be born, as a true antithesis to the ways the world has been set to move is, as proven before, impossible.

It's actually not a topic that has been researched quite a lot and it's in fact very interesting.

The earliest findings are actually related to skeletons that were found in Africa. Some skeletons showed similar marks close to the last knuckle which may indicate that nails were rubbed against rocks or stones rather than cut. It is speculated that hair may have been rubbed against stones similarly but no clear evidence of this practice has been found.

The earliest cutting of hair can be traced back to the Chinese who, contrary to popular belief, did not invent scissors. They in fact used one stone plate and cut a sharp object across it, much like we use cutting boards these days. This practice spread to the West via the silk route and was eventually adapted into two sharp objects interconnected in a very similar fashion to modern scissors.

Nails were still filed short for a very long time after this however since it was still impossible for artisans to produce rounded scissors. This all changed with improvements in metallurgy after the dark ages and now we have all kinds of nail cutters. It's interesting to know it all started with a stone.",Harregarre

It originated in the village of Trazare on the eastern coast of Guinea. According to local accounts, patient zero became infected when she was attacked by an infected bat. The disease was spread to medical personnel who attended her afterwards due to poor sanitary procedures. Within two months, most small towns and villages had lost 15-20% of their population to the disease, whereas cities fared better with 5-10% losses. In August 2014, the disease spread to Liberia, via refugees fleeing the disease without realising they themselves had it, either because it was only in the early stages, or they were carriers (they had the virus in their bodies and could transmit it, but were unaffected by it). Liberia responded by more stringently patrolling its borders and implementing mandatory health checks for people entering the country. This strategy was undermined by a bureaucratic oversight. Public servants tasked with performing the checks were not provided with proper PPE (personal protective equipment) and caught the disease easily from the refugees. Thus, the disease entered Liberia. Within weeks, every hospital in its capital, Freetown, had been filled. Not long after, developed nations began to realise Africa's need for aid.",TinkyWinkyIlluminati

He came down from the heavens to teach people the power of the sun. During the 2nd Age, the Egyptians slowly dissipated the ancient teachings of sacrificing blood to the sun. The yin and yang of not praying resulted in the Sun radiating poisoness energy that killed every first born daughter, resulting in a reproducing problem. The men turned into hyenas, fighting over every women to order to gain her hand in marriage.

	When the spirit of Ra first descended onto earth he gained the trust of the Egyptians by radiating the sun onto the Pharaoh, King Umanuma, and combusting his head into two at the annual Agriculture Fair, the largest gathering of Egyptians. King Umanuma's body rose and ascended to the top of the temple, where Ra stood. Ra tore apart the rest of his body, and put it on as a cape. Ra then made the 'Speech of the Sun' “ People of Egypt! How is it that you have forgotten my essence. The power of the sun. The one that brings you light. Have you not wondered why days are shorter, why your first born daughter loses her essence before the age of two. From this day forward the Sun shall not be forgotten! The sacrifice of blood to the sun is now law!” The room was quiet, people were frightened and confused for these teachings had been long forgotten in history. “You can make a change and redeem your kingdom! He who prays to me shall receive an hours worth of more light, those who sacrifice their blood will have their first born daughter live. I don't need a whole body's worth, just a couple drops. I will even make it easy for you. From now on Osiday shall be named Sunday. So that you remember to pray to me.”

	The people of Egypt changed, their days were longer and their daughters lived. All was well within the Egyptian kingdom but in the far east, the samurai gained word of an Egyptian God descending upon earth. Ra contradicted their teachings of religion. The head Samurai, So Yo Wise As, lead an army into Egypt and killed Ra. They buried his body deep beneath the tallest pyramid so he could never see the sun again.

"[CW] Write about a topic you know virtually *nothing* about, and try to appear knowledgeable. Don't look it up - just try to BS your way through it.",CaspianX2,"Brain surgery, although one of the most remarkable features of the modern age, is an ancient practice. Many ancient cultures - including the Egyptians, the Chinese, the Greeks, and American tribes - independently discovered that drilling a whole in the head of a  psychotic individual would sometimes restore them to health. Different cultures developed different theories about why this worked, ranging from supernatural to highly accurate. Indeed the ancient Egyptians, with their superior knowledge of anatomy, are recorded to have actually removed tumors from the brains of ailing patients who made full recoveries.

Sadly, instead of becoming refined over the early centuries of human history, brain surgery was lost to the West, records indicating that an unsuccessful operation in 306 BC was the last to be performed in centuries. There was a brief resurgence after the rise of the Islamic states, but that too disappeared. However, the techniques of the Chinese were preserved throughout the centuries, and inspired French doctor Louis Picard to develop the foundations of modern neurosurgery, releasing his magnum opus in 1834.

Picard was able to establish a 25% survival rate, and 10% success rate, for operations on patients who were otherwise assured to die, quite a remarkable feat in an era which eschewed sterilization. The anatomy of the brain had been understood since ancient times, although with some inaccuracies; Picard was able to refine this knowledge, determining which parts of the brain were responsible for which human processes. He then knew where to look for injury based on a patient's symptoms, and could reshape or remove bruised or distorted tissue as his experimentation indicated was appropriate. He could remove a tumor from the surface of the brain while minimizing damage to more important regions.

Since most of the brain's primary processes are performed in the tissue on its surface, it had historically been difficult to rectify damage or remove a tumor from deep inside the brain. Picard learned from treating injured patients which parts of the brain could be ""adjusted"" with minimal side effects, and entered the brain through those regions.

Decades later the medical community came to espouse sterilization, and the success of brain surgery based on Picard's work skyrocketed. Neurosurgery became adopted first across France, then Europe, then the world. Surgeons in the early 20th century discovered that the least damaging way to enter deep inside the brain was to simply cut the brain in half, between its left and right lobes. Damage to the corpus colosum, which held those lobes together, was discovered not to significantly impact the lives of patients.

Modern neuroscience is still based on these principles. ",Conan_Oddline

During this economic boom, enabled by the advent and subsequent commercialization of the internet, the birth of numerous other social media sites including but not limited to Reddit, Digg, and 2Chan (today known as ""4chan"") occurred. Today, these three sites dominate the social media industry and account for over 67% of all social media site traffic. The brainchild of Berta Lovejoy (Born 1967), Tumblr was not originally founded with dreams of commercial success in mind. As Lovejoy states in this [2003 NSBC interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ), she had never imagined that some seven hundred million users would come together to form the rich culture that has developed over the years . In fact, according to Lovejoy,""I'd originally intended the site to be a secluded bastion of free speech and acceptance for like-minded individuals, but over the course of the years, the site exploded with popularity and entered the mainstream."" Today, the site boasts over some five hundred thousand individual blogs with over 1.6 billion images and text posts shared every **day**. ""I'm proud of what I've accomplished and frankly, I don't believe that successful women like myself are acknowledged for our achievements enough in the modern world."" A staunch feminist, Lovejoy has founded and donated over 5,000,000$ to AWCO (Advancing Women's Career Opportunities), an educational non-profit organization promoting increased female participation and study in STEM fields. Lovejoy recently came under media controversy for her comments regarding Bruce Jenner. ""I don't believe you can just have a sex change operation and call yourself a woman. You never experienced the oppression and hardships that come with being a woman. Being a women isn't just about having a vagina."" On December 2015 however, she apologized for her comments, characterizing her words as ""rude"" and ""harmful.""

Indeed, the uncontrolled consumption of the island's natural resources offers hard truths, even to modern societies, of failing to properly and efficiently regulate available resources in a manner that allows continued growth. When prosperity is ever the goal of any civilization hoping to achieve its apex, there is a willful blindness to managing the fruits offered by the land and sea.

Easter Island serves as a reminder that no matter how stable a society appears to be, it can easily collapse under the all to real and acute strain of resource scarcity.

According to the U.S Department of Labor, dildo assemblers are paid anywhere from $56,560 to $68,500 per year with a median wage of $63,270 which is 18.4% higher than the average factory worker. Dildo designers can make up to $97,000 based on performance and management positions start at $112,000. Dildo testers and customer service make up the low end of the pay scale (although companies often provide testers with access to streaming software for additional income) and earn a median wage of $37,879 a year. 

PhD Harry Dick, a professor at Leftsville University, Maryland says the vibrant industry is an anomaly in the capitalist machine. He goes on to mention that there is a huge amount of competition that drives down the prices of American dildo's and increases wages, a fact that baffles his economist colleagues. He even goes on to talk about the fact that all 873 manufacturing companies provide excellent health insurance and most employees only work 35 to 38 hours a week. He also has done some incredible datamining on the demand side of this phenomenon. ""There is not only a huge demand for rubber dicks, but toys of all sizes, and various materials"" stating that several of the manufacturers are only subsidiaries of larger industrial companies such as the RAPT corporation, a sheet glass manufacturer who has diverted extra material not suited for production in the auto industry; and instead sends it to a smaller site that blows glass dildo's. 

We reached out to RAPT, but they gave us the shaft. So we decided to run the numbers and came up with the total number of artificial dongs produced per year (4,650,865) and the amount of different materials used in production (156, including raw elements, and compounds) and the dildo recycling program numbers which clock in at 579,854 dildo's recycled per year.

"[CW] Write about a topic you know virtually *nothing* about, and try to appear knowledgeable. Don't look it up - just try to BS your way through it.",CaspianX2,"There is a certain spectrum within the field of biology that solely focuses on all winged and flying fauna. This sub-field of biology is aptly name, ***organic aviology***. The etymology of this term is based on the Latin root words of ""Avi-"", for flight and ""-Oglogy"" for study of, and was coined in 1896 by German biologist Franz Skölkoft. One should note in studying organic aviology (ay-vee-o-ah-lo-gee) that it is simply a part, if not the oldest and most natural aspect, of aviology as a whole, which covers the entire spectrum of flight, from the science behind airplane mechanisms to programing the flight engine in games like Spyro the Dragon for the Sony Playstation. It should be further noted that phenomena such as levitation and gliding fall under their own fields of science, being *leviotonomy* (leh-vee-o-tah-no-me) and *glidiology* (gle-dee-o-ah-lo-gee).

The school of organic aviology sparked off the discoveries and theories of biological evolution of species by the renowned biologist, Charles Darwin. Franz Skölkoft, a student of Darwin's work, was  among the first to use Darwin's theories and apply them to the understanding of flight in the Animal Kingdom. Initially studying the bone structures of long dead species of bats, in comparison to modern fruit bat species, Skölkoft quickly branched out his study to many types of avian predators and winged insects.

Under a research collaboration with American physicist, Jim Humphrey, Skölkoft was able to develop a thesis and make paramount discoveries on the finer points of flight in fauna, such as takeoff, balance of centripetal force, and acceleration. In 1901, Franz Skölkoft and Humphrey co-published their thesis on organic aviology, which concluded 3 points: 1) All winged life likely evolved from a common ancestor that lived during the Paleozoic Era, called the *aviclovicus afranesis*, 2) Although the muscular form of the wings of winged life varies greatly from species to species, there is a unseen common denominator shared between all winged creatures, and 3) all winged creatures break the constraints of friction in the air, and thus takeoff, through manipulation of the air around them in the process of takeoff, this manipulation of atmospheric pressure is referred to as *elevated decompression*.

By the 1970s, all of Skölkoft's hypotheses would be tested and proven into theory. His second hypothesis in particular would be expanded upon in 1975 by an American-led team in Havard, which after studying the brain structure of winged fauna, were able to conclude that, ""The nerves that trigger flight in all winged fauna is controlled in a section of the brain not found in non-winged fauna, called the *ampiglocal flageges*.""

Don't look it up - just try to BS your way through it.",CaspianX2,"Computer coding is the way of the future! Now more than ever you need to learn how to program and create applications to use in business and personal life.  
Here is a quick how-to on what coding is comprised of:  
1.  First, you need to know the history of coding! Coding begins with the numbers 1 and 0. In order to properly code, you have to know the rules of binary composition. This may seem like a big task... because it is! That's why programmers get paid the big bucks.  
2.  Next, you need a way to actually put those 1s and 0s into a program that can run your code! Back in the day, people had to use either ""Notepad"" or ""Run"" in order to create the line breaks to keep a code organized. Nowadays, you can use ""sticky notes"" on your PC or ""Google Keep"" on your Android phone to keep track of basic lists of code :D  
3.  Now come the actual rules of coding. There are three main key words you need to know: ""nest,"" ""loop,"" and ""module.""  
""Nest"" is a way of organizing words (order matters!) to make a program run through a code and then go back to the beginning, or the ""nest"" to run all over again for optimization. (Picture a bird coming back to the nest to feed and grow chicks... that's the idea behind nesting a code, so it gets better.)  
""Loop"" is a unique feature in traditional coding; looping a code forces a program to iterate the same program over and over until a result is reached. You may have heard of ""debugging,"" well this is a form of debugging that causes a program to loop through the whole code, each time skipping only ONE line, to see if there are any unnecessary additions to the code. It is a very useful tool, although time-consuming.  
""Module"" is a fancy name for a program. That is all. I don't know why they just don't call it program, but in all fields of discourse most people try to make themselves sound smarter.  
4.  The last thing you need to know are all the basic types of code! They can all pretty much do the same thing, it's all a matter of what your preference is. (Picture all of the spoken languages in the world... they can all use words to describe something going on in life, but its a matter of preference. Perhaps the sultry silk of Latin-based languages, the harsh command of Germanic languages, or the tangy texture of Asian languages!) Personally, I believe Java and C++ are the most used and most accepted coding languages. I keep hearing their names being thrown around near computer labs, so they must be important.

Thanks for reading, and hopefully this will get you to coding in no time!

Gravity is theorised to portray itself almost in ""pulse waves"" that affect everything around it. Atoms and molecules have a specific ""pulse"" rate or frequency (which leads us on to whether gravity is similar to light in that it works both as a wave and a ((pseudo))particle, but that's another matter). By measuring the specific style of pulse we can ascertain which atoms are creating the gravitational affect. If we can direct that pulse to match atoms within a certain distance who also *share that pulse frequency* we can cause them to almost mimic each other. At the moment this is still in its infancy though, so narrowing it down to one atom affecting one atom, or a pulse intraction ratio (P.I.R.) of 1:1 is difficult and we can instead only affect groups of atoms in a certain area (best at this time is a P.I.R. of 1:3.5K). 

Progression in the future has been looking at ways of better directing the P.I.R. while also managing to interact multiple different elements within the same area (Multi-pulse Interaction Fraction - M.I.F). ",AJohnsonOrange

If a 'nearby' universe was on its last leg and was approaching its enthropic fate which we will represent with the number 0 we can devise this equation.

 0≥x((i+E)-N)-1

The universe's total energy is represented by X, active energy by E, initial energy by i, and entropic force by N.

The initial energy is the 'primer' that allowed for the rapid expansion of the universe. The match that set off the big bang to put it in layman's terms. Active energy is the energy not yet affected by entropic forces of not in conversion to another state. Now, when we discuss N in terms of this equation it should be noted that within this equation we cannot find the rate at which entropy occurs to our own universe. We have used the unobserved constant, N, for the time being. When we solve for the energy standing is and multiply it by the universe's resonant energy. This is all forms of matter that hold any energy that do not fall within the predefined parameters.

Shifting back to the dying universe, the last sherds of energy cannot lose to entropic forces because at that moment entropy would become positive. So a tear is formed in the makeup of the universe letting the last amount to 'leak' into an 'adjacent' universe. I am forgoing extrapolating into string theory or transition shifts for the sake of time. But the lost energy becomes the ignition for a dormant universe to kickstart. So no universe truly dies but is transferred and birth anew

Despite such an enormous percentage many humans, though aware that they exist, are not exactly sure how to understand the complexity of the species. Every day nearly every human and animal comes into contact with a Namow, and yet despite a near infinite amount of research over hundreds of years, not much more is known about them than the fact that when studied or questioned they can create more confusion than before.

In regards to collected information, some of the studies have shown there to be a vast selections of rituals typical Namows undergo every day. On multiple occasions they will dress themselves in the tightest of fabrics, often in multiple layers and is said to attract others of their kind. As another morning ritual it is not uncommon for them to cook their heads in an oven-like apparatus on temperatures ranging higher than 300 degrees Farenheit. They will wear mud on their faces, strap their body parts in contorting poses, rip out their hair with metal tools, and often use sharp blades to scrape across their skin as a showy sign of adulthood. 

Few Namows are able to conduct interviews because they delight in giving answers that do not represent what they truly mean. Coloquially, an answer of 'no' has been found to mean 'yes' and the same goes for the opposite. They delight in grouping together with like-minded Namows, but will just as quickly turn and unleash a stream of soul tarnishing lies or gossip of each other for purposes seemingly of, but not limited too, delight, revenge, and entertainment.

 They do not support each other, they delight in the misfortunes of their peers, they thrive on the downfalls of each other. It is a scientific wonder they have survived this long as a majority on the planet Earth.

Rockets, cylindrical vessels made of carbonized alloys and nanometallurgical sheets, formed into hollow tubes, and filled with hyperfossolic fuel, which burn into temperatures well above standard feynman limits of 5000k~6000k. This burning creates a super-plasmatic heat, which propels the rocket into the upper barometer, just below the atmospheric barontrometer, which is the shielding that prevents gravity from being warped by astronautical fluid dianetics, or ""space radiation"". At this point the ""rocket"" portion of the rockets detaches and falls into the ocean, propelling the ""rocket tip"", also known as the cylindrocket or cylindrometer, which is named after the shape of the rocket(cylinder) and the point at which it separates(barontrometer).

Once the tip passes through the upper atmospheric scion field, it is free to travel using solar rays converted into flux spectromical faxintators that propel the tip through space warp. The study of space and things in space like planets and planetoids is so important because of science and it's immense contribution to our society and cities, and the children. Because I believe the children are our future, and we have a responsibility to teach them well and let them leave the way; to show them all the beauty we have left inside.

Because of this 99% of the population is either imprisoned or on parole due to one of the million insane laws passed in the past five years.,Dazarbalt,"""And since *when* has swearing in public been an imprisonable offence?"" I asked.

The officer didn't even break stride as he put my arms behind my back. The cafe owner, one of the few left trading honestly, looked terrified. He hadn't meant to provoke me to the point of swearing. Once I had said 'for fuck's sake' the police had been called in, and as is usual in this day and age they come pretty quick - after all, there were very few people left to arrest. I resisted.

""Resisting isn't going to get you anywhere,"" the police officer said. ""You are under arrest-""

I looked at the shopkeeper. Did he dare? The cop had his handcuffs out.

I kicked out, my heel striking the cop's shinbone, and as he reeled backwards I turned around to face him. He looked surprised, but there was something more - terror. US cops were not used to resistance anymore. Seeing this, I threw everything into my punch. The crunch of the cop's nose breaking was followed with the thud as his back hit a table. I stuck out my foot, and the cop went over it, crashed into the table, and moved no more.

In the sudden silence the sounds of the fight were magnified many times over. 

I looked at the shopkeeper. Oh, I was really in for it now. Attacking a cop was one of those old-fashioned criminal offences that could now earn you life in prison. And as surprising as it might sound, I didn't want to spend my life in prison. It was really ironic how I, the dangerous criminal, was on the loose while my friends were all on the inside for something simple like texting while driving. At their case, the prosecution had said it was the singular worst case of texting and driving he had ever seen. He had looked down for five whole seconds. Now, we can't have *that,* now can we? Anything but texting and driving. Six months minimum was handed down. It would definitely be way more in my case.

The shopkeeper stared at me as if I had just murdered his mom. I hesitated. He'd seen me. ""Sorry about the damage,"" I said to the shopkeeper. 

He shook his head instantly. ""No, it's nothing! Don't worry about it, man."" I saw that he looked absolutely terrified. Heh, being a criminal was fun. When you've done something to deserve life imprisonment anything goes. So I screwed up my mouth, put on my best gangster face, and snarled, ""If you say anything, I'll be back, and there'll be no more second *fucking chances.* Now is that clear, amigo?""

He nodded quickly. I strolled out of the shop. There wasn't much time to lose. Every citizen of the US had a contigency plan for moments like these. You never knew when you were going to be arrested, and hovercar getaways were exclusively reserved for the 0.001%. Mine was to go to the end of this street. Could I get there?

I saw another officer approaching, and quickly I ducked into a side street. There were two thirteen-year old boys - possibly brothers - hiding out there, and they both jumped back in surprise. ""You-""

Before they could say a word, I lunged for them, and put one hand on either mouth.

""Now listen to me, you *cocksuckers,*"" I said. The swear had the desired effect - their eyes bulged. Both of them now knew they were dealing with a proper criminal. ""Don't say a word to the police. I'm going to need your help to get away. You boys heard of a getaway plan? Nod for yes or shake for no.""

They both nodded. Now came the part that was complete bullshit.

""You're going to help me, or I'll kill you two."" 

Hearing this, they struggled a bit, but I had them both under control. Quickly, their shakings subsided. ""But I won't, if you help me. Will you help me?""

Two nods. I released them both. ""Very well. There's a policeman out there and I want one of you to be a decoy. The other person will come with me to the end of the road. If we meet someone else on the way, I'm your father and I'm taking you to see the execution, alright?""

They both nodded a third time. 

""Alright, let's get going,"" I said. ""Won't want to miss when a judge is shot dead, now won't we?"" 

One of them was already moving. Seeing the police officer through the side street, I took a deep breath. This was either going to work or fail spectacularly.

Would there be more?

---

The first inkling that the officer got of trouble came from the boy's screech.

""Stop!"" the officer said. ""You are wanted for truancy!""

I pushed the other boy ahead of me. ""Walk,"" I said. ""Your brother will join us.""

That was the second lie. I had no idea what would happen for his brother. Did it matter? The boy was walking ahead of me. The policeman was looking the other way, chasing the screams of a thirteen year old boy who was running for his brother's life. Such was life for the few free citizens in the land of the free.

What could possibly go wrong? 

I reached the end of the road without incident. There was an abandoned shop on the corner. I could see my grab bag in there. A gun peeked out of the top. Hey, at least the prison lobbyists left the Second Amendment untouched. I got over and stuffed the weapon deeper into the bag, before I noticed that the boy was still standing there.

""What?"" I asked, playing the part. ""What're you still doing here? Scram!""

""Did you...did you say there was going to be an execution?""

I shouldered my pack. ""Yeah, Chief Justice of some sort. Why?""

He didn't say anything. I looked at him, saw how well his face matched his brother's. In my head I was already rehearsing my story to the Canadian border force. And then I looked at the boy again, and it hit me.

""Oh, no, no...he's not your father, now is he?""

The boy was silent.

I sighed, knowing now that there was no choice. The boy had saved my life. Canada could wait. 

""Right, let's go,"" I said. ""We're going to save your dad.""",KCcracker

With the paper publishing new laws every day, the front page had a new headline of something big being passed.  
  
Today, the paper was written in perfect Queen's English. The headline read ""Informal Language is Considered a Criminal Offense."" and the rest of the paper read just like a research paper.  
  
So, they banned slang. Even the word was now considered to be against the law, and there was nothing we could do about it.  
  
When I spoke to my wife, as I had to marry her to be able to live with her despite the fact that I had no true feelings for her anymore but divorce was also illegal, I spoke in proper English. She nodded when I pointed at the paper.  
  
I had to protect my best friend, even if I no longer loved her. And they were listening, so we continued to follow the law.  
  
I finished my coffee and dry toast, having anything else for breakfast was a criminal offense, I prepared to head to work.

But, in my hidden basement, rigged up by our friend who was an electrician before he got arrested, I worked.   
  
There are just three official radio stations. Sanctioned news, sanctioned music, and a channel dedicated to releasing law. But, if you could program your radio right, you could find a long list of hidden channels. Release dates listed, forbidden comedy, interviews with the hidden condemned.  
  
And I just happened to run the city's biggest music channel. Songs of old that were banned and new songs. Songs about love, songs about loss but, most importantly, songs of rebellion. Garage bands became basement bands, preforming in muted spaces.  
  
Bands that I played could end up arrested and even executed. But they'd go down as heroes and have their names spread everywhere.

He leaned back in his old, squeaky office chair and plopped his feet on the desk.  ""You know,"" he said.  ""There was a time when people would literally *kill* to go to the moon.""  

Jeff didn't listen.  His mind was racing, searching for the right words to describe the rage he felt right now.  ""I worked my ass off for *years. . . ""*

Davis waved his arms.  ""Yeah, yeah, I've heard it all before.  *Years.*  Yada yada.  Listen.""  He brought his feet down and leaned forward, his palms touching the desk in some sort of menacing power stance.  ""There are 10 billion people on that planet down there, and I know that 5 of those 10 would love to have half the job you have.""  He paused, collecting his thoughts.  ""Let alone to go to the moon.""

Jeff sighed.  It was different for people like *him,* the elite.  He had the fortune of being born on Space Station Alpha, and, as such, was awarded all the perks of being a spaceman.  He had already seen most of the solar system when he was just a little boy; he had probably been to the moon more than a hundred times.  The moon really was just a giant rock with a large underground base.  Nowhere near as cool as Mars, or Titan.

""Sir,"" he said, in a more placid tone, ""I've been your right hand man at the Courier's Office.  I've personally supervised over a *thousand* interplanetary deliveries throughout the past 25 years.  You know as well as I do that absolutely *nothing* happens at the moon.  That's where we've always sent the people we wanted to get rid of.""

Davis coughed.  His eyes widened.  ""Yeah,"" he said.  ""That's not an incorrect statement.""

The words stung.  ""Sir, why--""

Davis slammed his fists on the table.  He looked as if he were about to raise his voice; instead, he leaned in and whispered : ""Because they want to kill you, you god damn idiot!""

Jeff stepped back.  ""What do you mean?""

""The higher ups, the officers.  Last quarter we delivered something to Neptune Bravo . . .""

Jeff tuned out.  *Oh God.*  He knew what Davis was talking about.  Neptune Bravo was the most secretive government base in the entire solar system.  Three months ago, he supervised a delivery with one of the courier boys in a class-C ship.  The courier boy was new, and didn't understand the risks of dealing with government clients.  He was curious about the payload, so he opened the cargo bay doors, against Jeff's express permission.

Jeff punished him, but he couldn't help but glance inside the cargo bay to see for himself.  Inside, there were three enormous rods, mounted on one end with some sort of propulsion/guidance system.  They were payloads for orbital strikes.

Davis brought my attention back to the present.  ""After you fired that courier boy, I believe his name was Jacob, authorities found him hanging from his bunk in his quarters.""

Jeff shook his head.  ""He killed himself. . .""

""No,"" Davis said, bluntly.  ""I think they killed him.""  He got up and paced the room.  ""Look,"" he said.  ""I don't know what you saw.  I don't want to know.  But it's only a matter of time before they get to you.  You'll be safe at the moon.""

Jeff nodded, in disbelief.  ""I never would have guessed you cared about me this much, sir.""  

Davis smiled.  ""If you tell anyone, *I'll* kill you.""  They exchanged handshakes.

Jeff moved toward the door.  He had to go get his family from F-Quarters and catch the nearest shuttle to Lunar Base Charlie.  

""Wait!"" Davis called.  

Jeff spun around.  ""What?""

""I actually do want to know."" 

""Sir?  Is that safe?""

""Just tell me, god dammit!""

Jeff sighed.  ""Weapons, sir.  Enough to wipe out Earth.""  

Davis nodded solemnly.  ""I figured as much.""  He walked over to his tiny little porthole; every so often, the tiny blue sphere of Earth flashed into the spinning space station's field of view, and tiny rays of blue light illuminated the office.  ""It's a shame,"" Davis said.  ""But I guess there's nothing we can do.  It was bound to happen someday.""

""Yes, sir.""  

The two shook hands one last time.

Damn, I should have brought sunscreen. Or aloe vera.

He surveyed the mountains rising in east, their bare slopes painted with the reddening hues of sunset. Wisps of cloud high in the sky were tinged with pink, reminding him of cotton candy. As his eye traced down the slopes the color deepened to red, and finally merged gracefully with the shadow extending from the slopes opposite across the dry lake bed.

Well, at least it looks beautiful.

Turing his attention back to his pack, he rummaged around until he finally found what he was looking for, a crumpled sheet of paper with a map and some text printed on it. If there hadn't been a url at the bottom an outside observer might have suspected the coffee stained paper was from an ancient text written by some lost civilization. Strangely enough, it was. He had spend perhaps 4 paranoid weeks tracking down this particular text online, through forums, message boards, IRC channels, Wikipedia entries, and concerned looks from his girlfriend. But this wasn't exactly something new to him. Other Seekers were just as persistent.

Let me be the first please. Oh please let me be the first.

As he swung his pack onto his shoulder he repeated this mantra, over and over. At the back of his mind, his rational voice reminded him that he wasn't really the first, just the first after hundreds of years.

Oh shut up Mr. Technically Correct.

By his calculations he would reach the cave entrance around midnight. Not for the first time, he did a full check all around the lake bed, checking for signs of life. None.

When he had left for the middle of nowhere Nevada, he had told his girlfriend that he had wanted a break. He wasn't sure if she had really believed him, but he had prayed to whatever he was Seeking that she would believe him. His obsessive research right up to this point hadn't really been the first time he had been distant from her. This had really been the last in a long string of Seekings. She must have known this was another one. Her sad disappointment had hurt. She never chewed him out for his Seekings. She wasn't like that. But she had been dying a little each time he had gone Seeking. Maybe this was his god cleansing him. After all, she had her own devotion. Never mind that all she got out of it was freedom from headaches, muggings, and the occasional good fortune.

Every Chinese grandmother has that from their gods. What's so special about the Virgin of Gaudalupe?

What is meant is that what happens to a person can sometimes be both unpleasant and necessary. The night was clear and except for the noise of hundreds of soon to be slaughtered cows, quiet.

The boy cowered under one of the cattle carts, the cattle themselves were penned up in the center of the market awaiting the morning and their fates. The boy was  holding an injured foot in one hand. He was truly filthy. Layers of grime had accumulated on his frail body so much they had formed strata. Next time he swore he'd steal a better pair of boots. These ones hadn't lasted a season.

His head shot up. Legitimate beggars and thieves were everywhere in the market. He'd managed to sneak out from the ship moored at Pearl dock with the cattle but one of the the cows had stepped on his foot and if you've ever had your foot stepped on by a very large and very irritated bovine, you understand that what the boy had wanted to do, very much, was scream. Scream to the core of him, scream at the pain, and more besides.

Though it had sickened him to what was left of his stomach, he dared not make any noise. Having got this far, he wasn't going back. Not ever. Not after what they did, not after what he did back.

Rough hands grabbed him firmly by the shoulders.

“You are under arrest,” said a voice in the matter-of-fact tone of someone who knew they were utterly competent to make that claim but without even the faintest whiff of arrogance. All of this flashed through the boy’s mind as the strong hands whisked him out from under the cattle cart and into the back of a covered wagon. He barely had time to notice how thick the planks used to make the cart were before the doors closed and he was plunged into the quasi-darkness of the back of a hurry-up wagon.

“It’s a good thing we caught him before the guilds, Captain,” said a voice that the boy decided sounded like mince pie.

“This is True, Sergeant.”

“Especially the guild of cattle merchants, you never know how you’ll end up where they're concerned.”

“In a sausage, Sergeant?”

“Did you just make a joke sir?”

“The watch needs a stable boy,” said Captain Carrot.

They drove the wagon up Elm street with nothing to hear but clicking of hooves and clatter of wagon wheels on the cobbles. Then Colon broke the silence.

“Vimes’ll go spare.”

“You didn’t see the scars.”

“Scars?”

Sergeant Colon took his eyes off the cobblestones as they turned onto Treacle Mine Road to risk a glance at Carrot but quickly looked back at the road again. It was dark, he told himself, too dark to have seen what he saw. At least, dark enough to plausibly deny having seen it. A Sergeant doesn’t like to see his Captain cry.

The new old watch house was a beauty. The Duke of Ankh had spared every expense to make sure it was just like the old watch house. Nothing more, nothing less. Oh, there were a few improvements, but not so as anyone would notice until it was too late for them.

The wagon rolled towards the watch house gate and Corporal Nobby peeled himself off the wall he’d been helping to stay up and got the heavy studded oak doors open.

When the wagon was through, he shut it behind them and slid a bar along the inside of the doors. It rammed home with a satisfying clunk of solid wood and heavy metal.

“Who have we got here Fred?” said Nobby. Sniffing the air with a mixture of confusion and fear which was just Nobby being Nobby.

“Unlicensed thief, been bothering the cattle merchants Nobby, good to see you back on your feet,” said Colon.

“Igor did a fine job, but you know what, Fred?”

“Yes, Nobby?”

“He said he swore he knew me, well parts of me, from somewhere before.”

Colon looked at Nobby Nobbs the way one looks at a man on fire, that is to say, in an entirely new light.

“Fred?” 

“Nothing, Nobby, mistaken identity, I’m sure, you’ve got that kind of face.”

“Only he was so sure.”

“Come now Nobby, help us with this one, he’s to be a stable boy.”

Now it was Nobby’s turn to look at Colon in an entirely new light.

“Vimes’ll go spare.”

“It’s not my idea,” said Colon, pointing a thumb over his shoulder at Carrot who had been busy talking with the boy through the bars of the wagon doors. As Nobby and Fred approached, Carrot opened the doors and a frail, truly tiny boy, got carefully out of the wagon.

“He’s not going to try a runner, is he? You’re not going to scamper, are you?” said Colon, addressing the boy directly.

The boy shook his head slightly.

“I just told him what the guilds would do to him if they caught him first,” said Carrot, as if to forestall questions. “He won’t run, see Igor about his foot, I think it’s fractured..”

Nobby and Fred looked at each other.

“Didn’t have to scare him that much,” said Colon.

“Couldn’t you just have told him we’d stick pins under his nails or something?”

“Aye, Captain, the truth is a bit much, he’s just a boy.”

“You may be right,” said Carrot, quivering.

Even in the gloom of night, Nobby could see Carrot was literally shaking with barely contained rage. He did not want to be in the path of that fury when it broke out.

“We’ll get the boy cleaned up and bunk him in a spare cot,” said Fred and let the limping boy lean on him as they hobbled towards the light of the watch house proper. Nobby went with them but risked a glance back.

Captain carrot was standing where they’d left him. His hand on one of the bars of the hurry up wagon’s door.

The bar was ever so slightly bent.

Nobby shivered and followed the boy inside.

The boy had never seen the inside of a watch house, it was warm and bright. The watch officers were kind and gentle, even the trolls.

He’d never seen a troll up close before, they smelled like two rocks after you’ve banged them together a bit, it was a clean smell. The dwarves smelled like copper. He’d been bathed and given some ill fitting but warm bed clothes and an Igor had seen to his foot and he’d been put to bed.

Lying there in the dark, he realized he’d never felt so safe, sheltered, nay, well-guarded, as he did right then, falling to sleep in a watch house surrounded by officers of the City Watch of Ankh-Morpork.

He knew what he’d done and why and he’d spend a lifetime covering it up if he had to but under the serviceable and clean sheets of his cot he made a new decision.

When I grow up, he thought to himself, I’m going to be a copper.

[WP] Global warming has taken its toll. Write the story of the last glacier.,Gearedout,"The crowd of tourists gathered on the starboard side of The Intrepid, one of several ships floating just off the coast of Iceland, chatting away and snapping selfies with their friends and family they had managed to bring along to this once-in-a-lifetime event.

The Intrepid, the only non-scientific ship in the loose collection, vastly outsized every other ship in the waters nearby. Several large countries had sent scientific vessels to this location in order to photograph, scan and analyse the last large, natural iceberg in Earth’s oceans. What had once been a relatively small 17 meter block of sharp, cracked, frozen water had, over the last few weeks, broken off of inland Greenland, rolling downhill, being smashed into smaller and smaller pieces before falling into the ocean and floating north. The chunk of ice they had been following all this time was by far the largest, the previous ones that had once been part of the initial ice-fall and had made it to the ocean had melted within a day. It had gotten surprisingly far before today. During those few weeks, it had turned and rolled and melted away into the diffuse smattering of clear black ice that now remained, with a single shard protruding out the top at an awkward 30 degree angle.

The crowds of people from each ship murmured amongst themselves, sparing the occasional glance at the rapidly shrinking iceberg as it dipped up and down with the gentle waves. A wave of sad quietness rolled over the crowds as they noticed the icy protrusion had melted down and was unable to support itself, collapsing into the water. An unmoving black shine was all that remained, glinting the sun back at the watchers as they snapped their final photographs before heading to the warm interiors.

The captain of the Intrepid, after one of his crew had told him that it was gone, decided that enough was enough. It was only some ice, right? He set course back to land.

The boat turned in the water and began moving away. A young girl on the deck looked back as those that yet remained outside began their return to the ships interior. She tugged at her mothers hand, who turned to her. The young girl had a frown across her face, awkwardly standing on the tips of her toes to try and spot the tiny sprinkling of ice that still remained. Concerned, her mother asked, ""Yes, hon?""

She looked up at her mother, unable to spot the ice, and asked the most important question thus far in her short life, ""Mommy, now that the ice is gone, how will you get my drink cold again?""

[WP] Global warming has taken its toll. Write the story of the last glacier.,Gearedout,"The city of Rusty Can was a cold place built on the world's last remaining glacier. A glacier is not an ideal place to build a city, but to hold off global warming, and to prevent losing our last remaining glacier, the world came together and devised a plan to preserve and protect it. Of course people weren't able to build Rusty Can themselves, so industrial winterized robots were developed to build the city, and to become its caretakers upon completion. Countless hours were spent developing cute little square robots capable of building refrigeration units, and robot producing factories across the 200 square miles of the glacier. 1000 robots and 100 tons of steel were air dropped onto the glacier, and in 5 days the little robots built two robot producing factories capable of producing an extra 100 new robot a day each. New robots produced more factories, while the original robots moved on to build a new refrigeration unit. It went like this for close to a year before the the city was complete.

With the completion of the city, less robots were needed and most marched into the automated factories to be disassemble for parts. Some say little R1-15... one of the first robots air dropped to start the city was in this line marching to it's death, when for some reason it just stopped. The line in front of him continued to march, but all behind him would not move while he stood there blocking the predetermined path ahead. R1-15's sensors could see his fellow bots having arms removed and thrown into one pile, wheels removed and thrown into another pile, and worst of all, he could see the really worn bots melted to new parts made from him. The longer he waited the louder the noise behind him became; robot after robot bumping and clanging trying to continue on their death march. With beeps and whining R1-15 tried to explain what was ahead to his fellow builders, but as soon as he left the line they all continued.

The march went on for days as poor R1 watched little bots torn apart and scrapped by the thousands, until only a few were left carrying out maintenance tasks around the city. On some days R1 would follow or try to assist, but his fellow remaining bots would shoo him away with threatening movements. Deterred, R1 slept in the streets hacking into the city's power while other bots entered slots built into the sides of everything designed for charging. There are plenty of slots to accommodate R1 and all the remaining bots, but they didn't work for him because he no longer belonged. The years passed by with R1 hiding by day and stealing power by night because of elevated aggression from city bots. R1 was now viewed as an intruder by the city's defenses.

It is said, that out of desperation to belong, little R1 dropped part of a building on top of another bot. The bot was crushed and R1 tried to replace him, but the city made its own replacement and R1 was nearly caught. After, R1 fell into a great depression till one day he followed the coolant lines to the center Rust Can... the center of the glacier and superheated his core till he exploded. The explosion caused a huge cavity at the glaciers center, and the once automated city collapsed in on itself and was no more. And that is what happened to the world's last glacier.

"[WP] The humans never suspected, they were the apocalypse.",LoneWords,"Everything had always been so complicated. People will tell you that being a child is simple, and perhaps in a sense they are right, as life only grows and becomes more complex as time goes on. For me, that time of simplicity was woefully short, my station and expectations made abundantly clear early on. Dress sharp, smile for the cameras, make sure to bow your head the right way for the queen or king of some and such. Don't disgrace the family, the country, the world. And I obeyed, I kept myself clean, stayed above reproach. Even as I grew, I could have left and become messy like one of the others, uninhibited small people who surrounded me. Instead I remained, collecting and holding together the messy bundle all around me to make sure nothing slipped. So strange now that I would be one to cause the greatest mess ever seen.

All eyes were on me as I adjusted my cuff link and slowly made my way through the crowd of people surrounded glowing screens, ignoring the massive bright television taking up an entire wall of the bunker that cried insincere about the horrors of what they were witnessing in the streets of our nation. The looks on the faces all around me cared nothing for that, though, looking on only slack jawed and dry mouthed at my approach. Some had looked shocked when I told them to hold, only to grow wide eyed and uncertain when I said that I would be the one to do it. Was it savage of me to give the order and pull the trigger? Why should one be so much worse than the other?

It settled into my mind with each settling footstep that this was going to be the end. After so much complexity in the world it was a refreshingly simple thought. It had all been leading up to this anyways, and all of the small minds the world over struggled or refused to admit it, but there was always only one conclusion. It didn't matter, for as my fingertips brushed the pleasantly warm screen and my eyes that had charmed nations flicked up to watch the trajectory of the missiles leaving their nests I understood with more clarity than any man in history.

"[WP] The humans never suspected, they were the apocalypse.",LoneWords,"Ever since the invention of teleportation, life had become much simpler. At first, teleportation was slow, expensive, and took a massive amount of electricity to do. It wasn’t of much use, because the cost of other transportation types was much lower. Then, they started to refine the technology. It took less and less energy with each iteration, until personal teleporters were finally affordable by average citizens. Anyone could walk into their own personal teleporter and walk out of any other one. 

This was as good as life could get, they thought. Because transportation of goods was no longer an issue, costs for everything went down. Since prices were down, more people could afford to live better and the homeless problem was all but eradicated. Fewer people went hungry, so fewer people had to steal to survive, causing the sharpest plummet in crime anyone had ever seen. 

Lowered prices meant more budget could be spent on different avenues, such as space travel. Soon, they began development of small ships that contained only enough room for a few crew, an engine, and a few teleporters. They sent several ships to each habitable planet within range, the teleporters on-board allowing the crews to switch out as they please and return to their families on Earth. When the ships landed on the planets, colonization began, and so, humans inhabited the stars.

Teleportation, the invention that solved world hunger, over population, and allowed ease of access to the stars, would soon be the downfall of all humanity.

Technology still advanced on Earth quickest of all as it was the oldest civilization, and so they developed the newest technologies first. They worked long and hard on teleportation, but couldn’t seem to break into the next step: teleportation to a coordinate, instead of from one pad to another. Many different models had been tried, but they all failed, until one day, they had a success. A junior scientist had accidentally discovered a way to teleport with no pad at all. Well, it wasn’t really “teleporting,” it was more of “flinging at high velocity through pseudo-space,” but teleporting sounded better to the marketers. 

The basics of how it worked: it first transported the subject out of the current universe, into one in which objects have no mass, then it applies a teensy, tiny push in the direction requested, enough to send you flying faster than light. After a certain amount of time, you reach your destination, and the device pulls you back into normal space. 

This was not common knowledge for the average citizen, if it was, they might not have accepted it so readily, and maybe humanity’s downfall would’ve been postponed.

Several devices were placed all around the globe that could accomplish this task of “teleportation” to a location, rather than to another pad. At first, they were only used for official business, such as taking ships further out than humans had ever gone before. Then, cruise ships were constructed to observe natural phenomenon light-years, light-decades, and even light-millennia away. 

“No distance too great” was the travel company’s slogan. If only they knew what it would bring.

Travel by this new form of “teleportation” was so popular, that more and more devices were constructed, until finally, you could download an app to your phone, press a button, it would send a signal to one of the devices and it would transport you anywhere in the universe. Automatically with your teleport, you get a “safety sphere” that pops around you when you arrive at your destination. All you had to do to get back is press another button, and it sends you back home. Distance became even less of an issue.

Through the decades of development of technologies such as teleportation, deep-space travel, and colonization of planets, crime had been nearly abolished. No one spent a single day in hunger or even discomfort. If they didn’t like where they were, they simply pressed a button and were whisked away into far-off lands. 

One day, an accident occurred with one of the teleportations. It was just one measly, little person who disappeared into the aether and didn’t return, but it caused an uproar. Teleportation accidents hadn’t been heard of for over a decade. So many safety devices and protocols were in place that no one had died from teleportation for so long. Investigations took place in order to find out what happened, but no one could explain it. Soon after that, another accident occurred, the equivalence of a bus full of school-children on a day trip to Beetlejuice disappeared. Another took place the day after when an entire building was scooped clean off the surface of Mars. Accidents continued to happen with seemingly random victims, but it wasn’t random. It wasn’t random at all.

It took weeks to discover the cause. Through their extremely fast advancement and development, humans had attracted too much attention from the other living beings in the universe. Even though they’d traveled to thousands of places all over the universe, there had been no signs of life on any other planet. It had been decided they were the only intelligent life, but they were wrong. These beings lived not in the universe humans resided in, but the universe humans used to travel between places. It took years for the beings to understand how humans were traveling in and out of their universe, and longer still to re-create it. Since these being were massless in their own universe, they were incredibly gigantic. One of them could encompass the entire solar system that Earth resided in. When their own began to die off through mysterious means, they investigated, only to discover miniscule beings popping into existence, piercing through them, travelling to distance space, and popping out of existence. 

To them, it was war. 

They began to pull in people and objects through into their space. They determined where the humans lived by “hotspots” in their own universe where space had become warped due to overuse. Eventually, they pulled in entire planets and destroyed them. Humans were on the defensive. By the time they discovered the true cause, it was too late. Too many research stations had been destroyed to find out how to prevent the beings from using their own technology against them. The beings were merciless in the destruction of the human race. They tracked down every last device whether it was destroyed or not, every human colonization, every last trace they ever existed was eradicated. They were extremely thorough.

And so, the war with the tiny, unnamed beings ended. For the rest of eternity, the other beings lived in peace.",Yulgalminakf

The Captain had given up on dignity. His balled fist trembled as he held it down against the intercom's switch. The channel was open, clear. He knew that they could hear him, whoever 'they' were. On the monitor, the blue forceshield pulsed gently, permitting the Earth vessel no closer.

""Our world is dead. Only a few hundred of us are left. If you have any mercy..."" His voice cracked. ""If you have any mercy, you'll take us in. We barely fled the Apocalypse, it--""

We humans; we humans who, as we so often boasted - and hubris ensures now that we shall never dare, or, daring as we might, be even capable of boasting again - of our successes. We are but animals; the worst of animals. Sure we can love, and not in the base expulsion of chemicals into a mate, but we can *feel*; we can enjoy the lines of a face as they meander down from cheek to jaw, casting shadows across the pink ellipse that resides beneath breathing nose. We can stare into blue eyes and think of sea; reminded of those days, in which, beneath the golden haze of noon, we would turn to our families and sigh, exhaling not air alone, but all the stresses with which we were, by school or work, imbued. We look into eyes and see, not eyes, but people; dreams, aspirations, memories: we see them all. So we like to think.  

But truly, we are more base, more porcine, than any squealing boar. They have innocence, those animals, innocence. Have we that? Have we ever possessed innocence? *But what of children?

Until the cracks were wide enough.

As the cities of Man are dragged below/
And the moon glares with a crimson glow/
Alien tongues whisper tales of a unspeakable doom/
That shall come from the distant gloom.

"[WP] The humans never suspected, they were the apocalypse.",LoneWords,"Humans. This species used to live on a planet Y57c ""Earth"" revolving around the star Y57 ""Sun"" in a galaxy MG312 ""Milkyway"" (or ""Milky Way""?). They're infamous for destroying their entire planetary system. Thanks to the large number of space probes and hundreds of years of broadcasting we now have enough information to conclude what had happened.  

We start with human folklore. It is as diverse as humans were themselves. For the purposes of this documentary we will only be focusing on one particular set of myths. Humans feared many things from other predators on Earth, alien invasion (silly humans) to the complete destruction of their world. Yes, ironically they caused what they feared the most.  

This deep rooted fear begins way back when they didn't have enough science to explain natural phenomena such as solar eclipse, earthquakes, tsunamis or hurricanes (explanation of these phenomena is out of scope of this documentary). They believed that it was some sort of higher beings punishing them. Later in their history they discovered comets and asteroids that could pass undetected, hit the Earth and wipe out its life. Around the same time they discovered nuclear weapons. This should have been first warning sign but the humans completely ignored it. Amazingly there were only two recorded instances of their use in a war.   

While this was all happening they were also destroying their own planet with dangerous gases, killing the trees that functioned as natural filters of the air. Simply put their planet was warming. This should have been warning sign number two. Again they ignored it.  

Next step in their quest to kill themselves was space exploration. They successfully landed on number of planets and asteroids. They mined them, set up their colonies there and thus severely changing their structure. This structural changed had a big impact on the orbit of these planets. The biggest issue had planet Y57d ""Mars"". It's structure changed so much that it started to get away from the Sun and closer to the planet Y57e ""Jupiter"". On it's way to Jupiter it collided with a large number of asteroids. Finally Mars got too close to Jupiter and the gravitational pull of Jupiter exceeded the pull of Sun and the two planets collided. This collision had huge impact on Jupiter's orbit and thus on the entire planetary system. Warning sign number three. Ignored.  

Final attempt at destroying themselves came when their tried to harness the energy from their star. Yes. They tried to use the full potential energy of the Sun. History shows us that this didn't go well. The entire planetary system vanished in a huge explosions. The few remaining humans who lived in far away planets died shortly thereafter.

"[WP] The humans never suspected, they were the apocalypse.",LoneWords,"The Salafids were plants, sentient but immobile. They spent lifetimes rooted in the soft gold dirt of their world. Near immortal, only brought low by disaster and competition for root space. Murders took years. The roots dug through earth, then through the targets roots, sapping nutrients. Starvation was their only death. Cut the head off a Salafid, the bulb full of pollen and synapse, and it regrew. The severed head grew a body. Two for the price of one. Stomp the small, winding petals and it grew again. Toppled sinewy trees would sprout anew from the body of the old. From the birth of their race, Salafids were drenched in sunlight, gorged with water. 

We brought steel and roofs, the stink of abused chemicals. To the Salafids, we were Famine. 

Osillions were thinking, conscious Mayflies. They were birthed in thousands of fist sized eggs. Hatched in hours. Grew exoskeletons, four arms, four legs, the chitin and organs, in days. Spent a week living, inventing, wandering. Mated, birthed thousands more, and died within the day. An Osillion lived in desperate abandon, aware that the grass would outlive them. Cities rose in weeks, blocks named for the building generation. Philosophy was a joke to them. Religion took too much patience.

We brought ideals, morality, and the greater good. With demands for higher purpose, we were their War. 

At the edge of Andromeda, the Kin lived under the endless ice of a sunless planet. Their star was a distant red glare in the sky. The Kin swam beneath the ice, looking at stars. Leading slow, patient lives. With tendrils and webbing, a digestive track meant to work the dark bones of old volcanoes, the Kin never rushed. They spoke in whale song, and knew nothing of decay. A dead Kin was entombed in the stomachs of their friends, a high honor for a species that rarely ate. Otherwise the body would float up to the ice and remain. 

Chipping into the ice, we brought the rot of our species into their waters. Diseases and parasites adapting to sub-zero climate. We were the Kin's Plague.

The Star-shorn understood religion better than any. The sheer, blind faith, trusting what could not be trusted. Their world was dark, lit by glow beetles that ate the droppings of black holes. On long, spindly legs, Star-shorn walked the clay underneath. No mouths, but memories beyond their years, passed down by the land. A country had generations written in it. A continent was made of eons. The birth land, an island at the bottom of their planet, told them to never break bedrock. It was the fear of every Star-shorn, and their faith. They trusted clay to keep the strange, hungry things locked under the crust. 

With drills, we punctured clay and bedrock, drowning out the Star-shorn's silent pleas. Took gold, platinum, silver, and ran as the many eyes seeped out. For the Star-shorn, soon entire systems, we were Death.

It is easier to reflect the blame, than to take a closer look at your own actions. Some claimed that it can not be, we where the images of gods long lost. But our own actions showed us differently. 

It started simple, good life for all they said, at any price. There where warnings, there where prophets claiming to see the evil in us - but we locked them up and said that they were crazy. The man on the street corner, carrying a sign telling everyone to repent and change your ways - would you have taken him seriously. 

We where too busy with all the little things that we so like to do - live, work, consume. These where important, and we all needed to take part and be good ants in the hive. Fear. That is what we should have, we were told. To be afraid, don't go outside the box, it is dangerous. And the actions what we did for being afraid, they would ultimately lead to our discovery. But we also could reach greatness. Love and compassion. In the end, it did not matter, these things would be trampled.

We would dig too deep, reach to high and did no care about the consequences. In the end, we would understand what we are. We were like locust - apocalypse from the holy books. Consume and move on. In the end, we would become the thing we would fear the most - our own downfall.

It was a long process, over several hundreds of years, we would chip away what was called our humanity. It was restless times, millions died in different conflicts and destruction was massive. In the end, we would understand what we truly are. When all the humanity is taken away, we are remorseless and capable of anything.

Great ships left our home, looking for new places, spreading the apocalypse to all - deep down we understood our purpose now. We would set worlds on fire and stand on the ashes without remorse.

"[WP] The humans never suspected, they were the apocalypse.",LoneWords,"Humankind always imagined leaving Earth, but Earth would be their first casualty. They were always the solution and always had a solution for them, but they were never the problem, a race incapable of wrongdoing on the species level. When the world warmed, their kind denied it. When the life died, their kind denied any culpability in it, but they continued to thrive. They were beings meant to survive with their large brains and able bodies no matter what they left in their wake. So, they left Earth and spread, first to Mars then Titan. Then, they harnessed the energy of the sun and brought about it's red death and the death of their home solar system. But, again, their intelligence had saved them. Advanced technology with worm holes and faster than light travel broadened their reach to galaxies. Their numbers multiplied until they numbered in the trillions, then quadrillions, then quintillions, then sextilllions, and eventually septillions. Then, the Blorgon Galactic Empire pushed back, but humanity proved to be their apocalypse, then the Andromedian Galactic Republic suffered the same fate. With such vast numbers, no galaxy could hold them as they used up entire galaxies in years, and, like a virus, they spread through the universe. Their advanced technologies, intergalactic travel, and immense use of resources turned stars into black holes billions of years before their times. As the black holes ate planets and devoured solar systems, they merged into super black holes that were not the creation of humanity but an unfortunate consequence of their need to survive. As the universe became one massive black hole, it started to die 13.3 billion years ahead of schedule, and, finally, it would take humanity with it. When humankind vanished at the death of the universe, they continued to remain obstinate that the fault was at all their own, but humanity again found a way to live as a small group of humans invaded the multiverse bringing the apocalypse that came with them.

"[WP] The humans never suspected, they were the apocalypse.",LoneWords,"It was us. It was always us. T.S. Eliot was right, even in the ancient times: “This is the way the world ends / Not with a bang but a whimper.”

We feared the emptiness of death, we fought hard against it, but in the end it was our actions that brought upon the wrath of Heaven. Greed, pride, and blatant disregard for each other and the universe kick started the end of times. 

The Earth bled black oil and the skies clouded over with toxic perfumes. What was once green became brown. The oceans had swallowed much of the ancient coastline. The mythological city of Los Angeles lay somewhere in the depths of the brutal sea, home to warring sea monsters and tainted merfolk. 

Mercury was gone, the sun was beginning its death expansion. Soon it would swallow the Milky Way whole and contract back in upon itself. It would die, taking all traces of humanity with it.  Heaven was beginning to die.

Venus and Mars were shells of what they once were, depleted of all minerals and ore. 

The gaseous planets held some long-dead civilizations, huge pieces of advanced technology that float high in the skies in their own bio-domes, sustaining corpses of the Imperial colonizers with artificial intelligence. 
 
Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto were all untouched, far too cold for the evolved apes. Some whispered that these planets were next to sustain the ever increasing need of raw materials. 

Gabriel’s horn sang the apocalyptic dirge, calling in the final moments before Jormungand rose once more to battle Thor and Ragnarök began. Michael and Lucifer, one warrior angel falling from Heaven and one rising from Hell, met upon the aired land that was once a tropical rain forest for their final battle. Zeus and Shiva began their destructive rage, lightning and fire lighting the misty skies. 

But God? God was nowhere to be seen. None beheld Her warmth as the Darkness took His throne, because no one was left to see Her die. ",dezziebelle

Earth, the third planet from the sun, is unlike the other planets in the solar system, sol, in that it contains dihydrogen monoxide in all three phases of matter. This enabled the rapid development of organic macromolecules and soon life after stabilizing from its initial fiery creation. For billions of years Earth experienced a gradual evolution of its life, with a few more or less minor setbacks, towards higher complexities in that some species become so successful at thriving in their environment from very intricate biological processes that they have developed over time. This gradual evolution continued until one period in Earth’s history a species of primate began to develop a highly complex brain, advanced dexterity, and very rigorous survival instincts.  The species became self-aware and named themselves humans, or homo-sapiens in their more technical language.  They became so advanced that they began to develop ways of preventing their own extinction from events such as asteroid impacts and supervolcano eruptions. While they become so successful at thriving and surviving they neglected other species of life on the planet that did not influence their own survival. In their negligence they end up causing the 6th and most devastating extinction event in Earth’s history. Almost 87% of all species on Earth are wiped out into extinction. Of which only 14% were sampled by humans in order to preserve their DNA in case of some unforeseen future need of a particular species. Another 10% of all species are indeed in a state of apocalypse as humans have altered their habitats so drastically that it is difficult for them to survive. The other 3% of species have remained in stable numbers because they are either of great use for humans or are seen as docile, friendly, or fascinating enough to have as pets or to be showcased in amusement parks. In time the humans became so advanced that they synthesized their own evolution via genetic engineering and became wiser than they ever were. They realized that being human does not grant them the right to wreak havoc on the world’s other lifeforms. With great power comes great responsibility.

"[WP] The humans never suspected, they were the apocalypse.",LoneWords,"&gt;The Apocalypse is coming.

It had inconspicuously appeared on the outside wall of the cafe one morning, scrawled illegibly as most amateur graffiti was. It was noticed by nobody except for the cafe's owner, as well as the innocent bystanders who for the rest of the day had been subjected to his ranting and raving about the degeneracy of youth and the dangers of unchecked vandalism.

All in all, it was a normal day in small-town anywhere, which came and went just like most others did. In the following weeks, one would have been hard pressed to find more than a handful of people whose attention had been drawn to the slogan, now adorning two public schools, one arcade, six bus stops, and the cafe (for the second time), much to the chagrin of the owner who had just spent an evening scrubbing the original off of his establishment. 

&gt;The Apocalypse is coming.

And just like that, it had become an epidemic of gargantuan proportions. One morning the town was a spotless paragon of prosperity - the next, a seedy den of wreckage and debris. Seemingly overnight the grim message had become the talk of the town. The sheer volume of graffiti had made cleaning efforts useless. Nearly every building in town now carried the warning. 

Plans were devised to catch the perpetrators, now assumed to be working as a group. Unfortunately, the town's police force consisted of no more than a few squad cars and an aging sheriff. No matter where they set up, the messages would continue elsewhere. Eventually the neighbouring town, also consisting of a handful of squad cars, agreed to send over a few officers overnight in hopes of stopping the spread of the doom and gloom. 

&gt;The Apocalypse is coming.

As the citizens of the town woke up, they were greeted with cautiously good news. No new grafitti had appeared, as far as they could tell. Congratulating each other on a job well done, the townspeople went back to bed to sleep an extra hour, for it was Saturday, and they had had a busy week. 

The citizens of the neighbouring town however, had no such luck. For the message had spread. The first documented case of virulent graffiti had been recorded. The vandals had taken advantage of the lack of security, and simply moved their operations to the now poorly defended location.

For a brief moment in time, it was as if a hole had appeared in the dike. This time, there was no little Dutch child to plug it. The moment passed - the dam crumbled, and the apocalyptic message flooded into the world. Towns around the country, then the world, reported vandalism to billboards, churches, train stations, houses, mosques, synagogues, igloos, and even the cardboard and tin monstrosities in homeless tent cities. Each message was painted, drawn, scribbled, scratched, or shaved into the unfortunate targets, in all the various languages of the world. There were unsubstantiated reports of entire libraries opening one day to discover the paper in every single book had been altered to display the message in braille, so that everyone was aware of the fact that -

&gt;The Apocalypse is coming. 

And despite all of this, there was no consensus as to what the cause was. Perpetrators had not been caught, terror groups had not taken credit, and everybody seemed to have their own theory as to what was happening. Since this had all happened in the space of no more than 10 days, efforts to combat the spread had so far been limited and futile. The phenomenon of the virulent vandalism began to be tracked by epidemiologists, virologists, and governments, all with their own reasons for discovering the cause. The results were surprising to say the least. The epidemiologists found a proportional relationship between the disease and the movement of human population - implying the disease spread with humans, not animals. Virologists claimed that there was no medical evidence of any sort of disease, and that there were no indications of symptoms or organisms that could be detected by testing. And finally, the governments - well, they solved it. Sort of. Analysis of security cameras and police work determined that the message was indeed spread by humans. Short and tall, wide and narrow, light and dark, opposite and opposite. There were no similarities in the perpetrators except for one constant throughout the world - their faces were blurred. When caught in person, the perpetrators fled, seemingly undeterred by heavy police pursuit. No officers or personnel could even vaguely remember the descriptions of their targets. When caught on camera, the vandals faces were inexplicably blurred out, even on completely functional, brand new cameras. The mystery continued, unhindered by all efforts to stop it. 

&gt; The Apocalypse is coming. 

As it had started, the first clue inconspicuously appeared without any prior indication. Out of the blue, a clarity fell upon humanity. Workers, students, children, men and women woke up to evidence in front of their eyes. A veil had been lifted and realisation dawned upon corner of the world. Construction workers woke to hands covered in dried paint, teachers to chalk-stained pants, welders woke wearing masks. Outside, their work stood freshly gleaming for the world to see. Billboards painted, metal bars twisted in sick fashion, chalkboards covered in the message. None had any recollection of the events of that night, but all had committed the vandalism beyond a shadow of a doubt. Baffled, hordes of people turned themselves in to local stations, claiming mental illness or insomnia or drug abuse, asking to be protected from their own sleepwalking. With the prisons and jails overflowing with real criminals, the system clogged. Perpetrators were instructed to stay home while the cause of the anti-social behaviour was being researched. It was evident that the vandalism was not their fault, and it would be a waste of time detaining a vast majority of the world's population. 

The messages however, continued. People would wake refreshed and relaxed, having had a good nights sleep, only to find themselves at golf courses, park benches, and bus stations. Evidence of their transgressions stood in plain sight, but memories of the act nowhere to be found. 

And then one day they stopped. Just like that. Leaving their houses, people would check for new graffiti and find none. While they may have been baffled, no one was more confused than the taskforces assigned to investigate the phenomenon. It was as if a switch had been turned off, and the world was as it used to be. Hundreds of thousands of pages of research were useless. No cause had been discovered, no cure. No symptoms, either. A collective sigh of relief resounded through every boardroom and bedroom on the planet. Slowly but surely, things returned to normal. 

It took close to a year and a half for most towns to clean the damage, but it was done. The incident was chalked up to mass psychosis, perpetrators were let off the hook, and each wall, roof, and alleyway was scrubbed to the core, much to the delight of cleaning companies. A final investigative report ended at the conclusion that while the causes would never be determined, the world had evidently moved on. Nobody was at risk of further damage, physical or psychological. If anything, vandalism was down to unprecedented levels, and the clean-up efforts had revitalised many a small town for tourism. 


One sunny yet frosty winter morning, a bookstore owner whistled his way downtown to his shop. Walking past the strip of clothing stores, he smiled. Things were good. Sales were up, life had resumed. He rounded the corner, still smiling, and walked up to his door. Apart from the nasty fever that had been spreading, most people were happier these days. A day of work lay ahead of him, but he didn't mind. He coughed once, reminding himself to brew a cup of tea before his cough turned into something worse. Jiggling his keys in his hand, he stopped. Someone had spray-painted his glass display window. Odd. This was rarer than before - some little punk must have decided he'd scare everyone and remind them of the incident. Turning his head, he let out a gasp.

When the truth is that they all were correct. The world was ending, life as we know it did end, we just never recognized the devil's face.

It was us.

Humanity is a plague , a virus. We move into a pristine self-healing habitat and reproduce by the millions, soaking up all the resources. Once something stops sustaining it, we burn it and move on. Mother earth was a beautiful organisms. Over a million years it grew and nourished life at its teat. Dinosaurs existed for far longer than humans ever did, and Gaia blessed them with great strength and a lush world.

Their death was a blow to her soul.  Which was why she made the mistake of allowing humans to grow and develop. She made them smarter than their ancestors, substituting strength for intelligence, in the hope they could defend themselves.  

Unfortunately humans were a bit too well made. She wanted to give us a survival instinct,instead she gave us the virtue of greed. Every human is born with a hole inside them, and they go through life trying to cram that hole full of whatever they can grab on. By the time she realized her folly it was too late. Humans were a termite in the foundation, weakening her from within. First they killed the rest of the competition, dominating and enslaving her other children. They burned her, tore through her surface to greedily grab at the treasures beneath. The balance she maintained for so long, was broken so easily. They built walls on her rivers, tore down her mountains, set alight her forests. She watched as her children cried from the deep oceans and the high skies.

She tried to kill them.

The plague was supposed to weaken them, restore the balance. It worked for a few decades, but they found a way to fight it. She took to mutilating her own surface. Droughts and famine abounded. But humans adapted, finding ways to survive and grow even stronger. Even her violent rages of erupting volcanoes and typhoons barely thinned them down. She felt them grow on her skin, every second another parasite breathing life, even as all non-human life continued to extinguish.

She's tired now. Its no longer possible to fight them. They live in their metal boxes, barely ever seeing any natural beauty in their life. They ignore her existence, and yet relentlessly drain her to sustain this....this facade they have created for themselves. She's just...so tired.

Soon they will began to leave. The humans have figured how to leave her behind, to go visit her brothers and sisters in outer space. She doesn't know whether to be happy or sad. They were her apocalypse. Soon they might do the same for the rest of the galaxy

"[WP] The humans never suspected, they were the apocalypse.",LoneWords,"Diplomacy was always the hardest.  Fighting was easy, but talking, especially to make peace with or even talk to an enemy as ancient as those across from him.  300 million years produced a deep, foul hatred.  There was no bridging it.  Until, perhaps, today.

Coyote looked to mouse, moose, monkey, bat, elephant and tasmanian devil.  They had been elected to see if the enemy was finally willing to surrender.  They were deemed the best to negotiate the surrender.  To dictate terms.  To bring them all to peace.

Coyote looked back across the space to where the enemy was arriving: crane, kiwi, crocodile, turtle, eagle, robin, and raven all found their place.  They arrayed opposite from Coyote and his kind.  Raven's eyes burned and seemed to bore into coyote.  Coyote lolled out his tongue in a smile in the manner of his kind.

""Let us begin,"" began elephant, ""we are here to find terms for the final session of hostilities between our Great Clades, our Great Peoples.  No longer can the world bare the brunt of our devastating war.  We have won the war, but do not wish to commit genocide.  The bitterness within us is not so great or so deep.  Even so, we have won and shall be dictating the terms of your surrender.""

Crocodile hissed.  

And the negotiations began.  In earnest.

Their side would have to give up their potential for leviathans and behemoths.  The great backstab of the dinosaurs and their rise when we were the most vulnerable would never be repeated.  We would, in turn, reign in our most devastating weapon of mass destruction, one we unleashed 2 million years ago, when they, the enemy, were vulnerable and we were able to strike back.  Finally.  The project had taken that long once we had some modicum of dominance to develop and we'd warned them and warned them well at the onset of the Pleistocene Ice Age: negotiate an end of The War or be destroyed.

And they were devastated.

During one of the breaks in negotiation, Raven approached me.  I growled.  We had a long and bitter history.  Raven cocked its head and hopped closer, but carefully.

""Coyote, I do not think your kind realizes it may not be able to fulfill its promise.  The withdrawal of the weapon may not be possible.""

I yipped a ..crowing...laugh.  ""They are like us.  They will listen and stand down.  We have won and they made it possible.""

""Yes, you fur brain, they have.  But how many of your own side did they kill?  Do they kill?""  

I lolled out my tongue once more, ""War has casualties.  A herbivore would never had brought you down.  A carnivore would have been nearly impossible to control.  No, we made them well and they will listen to reason.""

""I hope so, Coyote, but I have my doubts.  I have watched them.  We have watched them.  They do not seem to be as controllable as you think.""  And raven hoped away.  We were going to wrap up and finish the negotiations with the pronouncement.

Monkey stood up and read off the treaty between our two great clades, the [archosaurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archosaur) and the [therapsids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapsid) would end the Great War.  Now and forever.  

There would be no more dinosaurs or other great archosaurian monsters again.  

And in turn, the therapsids, the mammals, all that was left of that once proud clade, would reign in their ultimate weapon: the humans.

We always expected and hoped that this ""end of the world"" would come in some grandiose, obvious, tragic and so romanticized shape. There wasn't anything, really. The sky hangs empty as ever, no messages. 

It came over time. An accelerating rate of panic caused by panic which later was brought to a halt by a collective sense of helplessness. This realization is personal, and over the course of months the elephant in the room outgrew the room. And one wanted to say it, those who did were silenced by denial. What was left was apathy, at least from personal experience I can tell that people gave up on most things eventually. Even if there was no looming threat over the horizon, most people just knew. With no global media announcements or a call to arms we were just left to wonder what was really happening. Some wondered always but they were no more than droplets in the oceans they couldn't replenish. There wasn't that much to figure out, as the reasons for all this mess were very obvious but mostly accidental byproducts of the natural will to make most of life which we now mourn.

I stopped counting time. The curtain was finally coming down, I could almost see it and wanted it to just get on with it. Well, we fucked it and we fucked it good. Big deal, there's always a next time.

My dad was rubbing the stubble of his neck as he shook his head in ponder.

""You used to just put in what you wanted into a single field, and everything you ever wanted to know - everything Charlie - would just pop up,"" he said staring blankly through me as he rocked in the living room chair. He peered back into my eyes. The ice cubes from his small whisky glass clanged while he spoke.

""You kids. You'll never know what it was like. Free to search for anything. Free to read anything. Free to *learn* anything. But now you're all... Brainwashed."" He jutted out his cup at me. The loud bangs at the front door continued, as did he, undisturbed. He was good at hiding it, but I knew he was afraid. It was the scratching the edge of his brow with his thumb as he looked to the floor, that was his tell. You couldn't talk about what happened before. That's why I reported him.

""Resident, open this door! You are in violation of Federal Code 37B. Historic references and spreading illegal information.""

He smirked. ""Damn scanners finally caught up with me,"" he scoffed. I opened my mouth, but then hesitated. I think he knew I reported him, but wanted to ease any guilt I may have had. He handed me a pre-written note from his shirt pocket. ""The site's not blocked through our hidden network. We made a full backup. Go to--""

He was interrupted by a crash and the rushing of several lumbering men in black heavy boots stunning him with their electrodes. I quickly stuffed the folded paper into my front pocket.

""What did he say,"" demanded one of the hidden faces.

""Nn-nothing, just ramblings of an old senile man, sir.""

He examined me for a few seconds. ""Alright, carry on then.""

And they left with my father. I reaffixed the VR remote work visor snugly against my temples. I was interrupted doing one of the jobs they made us do. I could hear the commander yelling through my speakers to figure out why I was refusing to continue with my task. ""Sir I have to log-out this is urgent."" And I logged off - I'd likely be reprimanded for an improper disconnect, but I didn't care.

Sifting through my pocket, I had already conjured a plan to burn the document while I quickly read the note.

Rather, it seemed to be viscous, flowing past Jay like a vat of syrup.

A 50 cal round floated through the air around 10 feet from his head.

He could see waves rippling off of the heavy metallic object, giving an added sense of fluidity to his surroundings.  

As the miniature zeppelin passed out of his peripheral, Jay could feel the shockwave from the round caress his body.  He was slowly thrown off of his feet, suspended in the air for what seemed like an eternity.  He hit the ground, 9mm shells littering the cracked ceramic tile.

The embankment in front of Jay exploded.  He felt the boom ripple past, watching in awe as the air was populated by a shower of debris and shrapnel.  Another explosion sounded somewhere overhead, this one gripping Jay’s prone figure and slamming him once again against the ground. The man’s head connected with he ceramic beneath, knocking him out cold.

———

It was dark once Jay regained consciousness, and the scent of smoke wafted through the air.

Picking his aching body off of the ground, he looked around at the remains of the terrace he had been positioned on; not much was left.

Jay walked up the slope, hoping to get a feel for the full aftermath of the skirmish.  He shed his shredded field jacket, dropping it in the grass as he crested the hill.
Far below the man, the local town lay in ruins.  Only a few lights could be seen blinking in the darkness of the valley.

He stood there, stationary on the hillside, gazing at the ruins below and the stars above.  It was quite beautiful here, despite the recent destruction that had swept through.

I'm here to carry out the job, not to inject my personal concerns or my morality.  It's the society we all live in, it's what society demands of us.  It wasn't my fault if you didn't understand that.

Who asks for these jobs?  The CIA, perhaps?  Some other black ops organization dedicated to research?  I don't know.  Never asked.  Never thought it mattered.

So, I go to a park.  I sit on a bench.  I receive my instructions.

""A man will come into your office.  It doesn't really matter what he says, or how you do it - we need you to drive him mad.  He'll say that he was referred by Alexia.""

So, that's it.  Drive a man mad.  How would I do that?

------

""Hello, Mr. James, was it?""  I asked.

""Yes.  Thank you for meeting me; Alexia highly recommended you.""

I had to admit, he was handsome.  Deep blue eyes, a firm jaw, just a touch of stubble.  ""Truly?  She's such a kind patient; I must thank her.  Here, have a seat.  First, I'd like to ask, are you familiar with hypnotherapy?""

""Well, I've heard of it.  Honestly...""  As he explained, I stared into his eyes.  I had read some of the details he provided the hospital staff and looked him up.  Quite the researcher, rumored to be working on something big.  And he's tall.

""I'm sorry, I seem to have been rambling.  Um, what do you need me to do?""  As he finishes his thoughts, I snap back to attention.  I'm always been a professional, I tell myself - focus on the job.  Just another target here.

""Yes, of course.  I'll just need you to lay down here.  Good.  Now, follow this watch, listen to my voice, very soon, you're going to feel very tired.  It's OK, this is a safe space.  My voice is safe, this is a safe space.""  I have no idea what I'm saying, but the sleeping gas will kick in soon enough.  It hardly matters what I say, so long as I don't spook him.  And I don't.

Soon enough, he's sound asleep, and the medical team comes in.  Starting tomorrow, the tinnitus will kick in.

I had the hospital staff set him up for two meetings a week.  He had already been feeling like his work didn't give him a sense of meaning, that he had lost interest in his work.

I suppressed any wonder I had at that starting point.

""Ever since I've had this ringing in my head, I can't focus.  I think of everything I owe my parents, I think I want to succeed, and for so long I though I enjoyed this research, but.""  He looks into my eyes, almost pleading.  ""I just.  I can't.  I don't know why, but this room, under your care, it's the only place I feel comfortable.""  

I freeze.  I can't help but think, yet more, about the projects he was researching.  They were so hopeful.

""Can we start?""  he looks at me, and smiles.

Damnit.  I have a job to do.  There's not many ""sessions"" left now.  What have I done?

The jeans giggled.

""That's *it*!"" I hissed, grabbing the offending garment and shoving it back in the drawer. ""I don't need pants anyway!""

""Well, that's where it wrong,"" the jeans responded, all too smugly, I thought.

""He's right,"" piped up my shirt. I looked at my chest in horror.

""Not you too, shirt?"" I gasped. ""I *trusted* you!"" 

I felt my shoulders shrug. ""Sorry,"" the shirt said. ""But you have to wear something."" The pants, from somewhere in the dresser, blew a raspberry.

""That's what you think!"" I howled, pulling the shirt over my head. I balled it up and hurled it into the far corner of the room. ""I don't need pants! I don't need a shirt!""

""Yeah,"" said a small voice below my waist. ""Screw those guys! You and me, that's all we need!""

I closed my eyes. ""Boxers, no. No, not you too.""

""Oh yeah,"" confirmed my underwear. ""We're in this together, buddy. Let's go take on the world!""

""Never!"" I howled, tearing myself free of the shorts. Surrounded by their protests, I burst out of my room, wearing only my own pride. 

""Luke!"" I yelled. ""My clothes are talking to me!""

""Again? Bogdan, I told you, you need to--ah, holy shit!"" Luke had turned a corner and taken in my glorious nakedness. He threw an arm over his eyes. ""Son of a bitch, dude, you can't just run around naked!""

""I'm free now! Free from the tyranny of pants! Never again, Luke!"" I started for the front door, but Luke, still covering his face, intercepted me. I feinted, and saw him hesitate--just as I thought! My nakedness was my strength! I slipped by him and exploded out the front door, onto the lawn.

[WP] You're deciding what to wear. Your clothes begin arguing with you.,Peow_peow,"I plant my hand beneath my chin and muse, my clothes scattered like some explosive collage upon my bed. It's a mess. I don't have a clue what to wear and the dinner reservations are for a table for two in only 45 minutes.

""Right, that'll just have to do. Trousers and shirt. No tie. No jumper, it's a bit on the warm side today, the shoes will do fine. Ok...""

Atypical of my mundane life, I often narrated my own actions but, and not what I was expecting, things took a turn for the downright bizarre. My clothes started arguing!

The jumper twitched its marino sleeves in indignation. ""Bloody idiot! That's right. Goodness knows you need it for later this evening, and the shirt is a pale blue. Do you know nothing of class my dear boy?""

My eyes bulged in my head and my jaw went slack. Did Colin Firth just possess my thirft shop Sunday-sly-buy?

""Er..."" Was all I managed before something else moved on the bed. The tie!

""Gracious yes, the boy clearly exhibits not an ounce of class, hence the desperate need to help the fellow. That being said, Colin, don't you quite suppose a jumper this time of evening, especially with the option of so luxurious a tie, is a little overboard? Jumping the mark, some might quip?"" Stephen Fry the tie announced, the ends eloquently waving in the air to each syllable.

Firth the Jumper quipped back, flailing a little more enthusiastically. ""Simply not. No. I disagree, I'm afraid. Sorry but a jumper is a must and a tie would ruin the entire affair. I must protest!""

""Oh is that so?""

""I-Indeed!""

The pair began flapping wildly whilst I tried piecing the broken fragments of my sanity crashing around me, into a semblance of normal consciousness. Something that was eluding me and, for what little hope, was actually a very life-like dream. I had been working long hours. Only, this little bubble of positivity was promptly popped when the french collar shirt chimed in, deep and menacing.

""Mr Firth. My Fry. Might I remind you, that fame quite clearly, isn't everything. Had you at some point during your foolish bickering, considered the *simple* fact that without the shirt, none of this would work? Had it entered your blithering *minds*?""

I gawked again! The jumper and the tie went just as still as I had and I couldn't believe my ears. Nor could I believe the courage I summoned to ask my shirt a question. 
""Professor Sna-?""

""Rickman! For *goodness sake!* My name, is Alan.... Rickman. Enunciate it. Speak it. Remember it. *Good.*""

A moment of silence fell then upon my nattering garments, a weird fuzzing and warm feeling enveloping my head. The oddness and strangeness of it all pushed me now into a state of mental free fall. And I was accepting of it, allowing it even. Wanting for it to go further. Please, I said to myself, let them continue. Perhaps they might provide me with an answer to my fashion faux-pas?

The next voice did not come from the bed to my immediate view, but instead to the trousers folded neatly by the stitching, closer to my pillow. Which, I might add now for simple stipulation, was entirely mute. Not a word and that was just fine. Normal even. 

""Items of meagre clothing. Please. Do not argue out loud in front of the human. You diminish the softness of the cotton and the strength yield of my denim with every lexical item regurgitated from the fathomless pits of your deplorable mind. So, please, i-you-must, do be quiet. The sound of your bickering is an incessant buzz. Frankly rude."" Proclaimed Benedict Cumberbatch, my freshly ironed chinos.

""Well, now l-listen here, Mr Cumberbitch.... Cumberbatch, sorry, I do apologise. Heavens... I..."" 

""Firth, please, allow me,"" Interrupted my tie. ""Mr Cumberbatch. Do us so kind as the simple pleasure of decorum for but a moment, so that we may arise as a satisfactory and resolute conlusion, for the pleasure of our guest here, the human.""

*""Will, this, whittling, never cease?""* Breathed my shirt.

Cumberbatch Chinos interjected quickly. ""Not so much as your perpetual infancy of mind may continue to use your mouths to convey sound. No, I'm afraid it won't.... *cease*.""

""Oh now really!"" Fry the tie bellowed, the tails flapping over toward the folded chinos by my pillow. ""Absolutely uncalled for and really quite rude. Apologise this instance.""

""Y-yes. Quite rude."" Chirpped my jumper, folding itself quietly into a smaller and smaller shape.

And then it descended into absolute and utter chaos. My room filled with screaming clothes, jumping around wildly on my duvet, attacking each other my slapping at the hems and cuffs, pulling at zips and popping buttons. I ducked as a clip came loose and sailed past my head.

Not a few moments has passed in the frenzy, nor a chance to escape my flat naked, than a loud, swearing, almost squeaky voice roared from the floor.

My polished oxfords had entered the debacle dramatically.

""Oh, I'm sorry, am I **INTERRUPTING!?** How are we ever going to resolve this?! Are you lot even *fucking* trying?! Is this a fucking *pantomime* that I unfortunately got sold the fucking ticket *for*?! A Jumper, a shirt, some chinos and a tie? A TIE?! YOU'RE ARGUING OVER A TIE?! WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT!?""

Horrfingly, my David Mitchell shoes turned on me, threatening to bash my shins in.

""YOU! This is all based on your absolute incompetence, a result from no **FUCKING** opposition apart from your utterly stupid brother who is actually just as fucking insulting the the ears. Christ. And all we wanted was to go to dinner. You wanted an outfit to attend a socially acceptable bit of dining, to eat food opposite one another's offensively average faces, to exchange meagre conversation about things that **NO ONE GIVES A FUCK ABOUT** before you enter a few months, maybe years, of completely wonderful and then terribly depressing and restrictive romance that shall, predictably, end in either a shitty breakup over Whatsapp or a divorce at the ripe age of **FUCKING 42!**""

The room was silent. There was a ringing in my ears. Looking down at my watch, stunned and speechless I saw that I now had 40 minutes to decide on what to wear and the date was a hastily swiped match on Tinder from a few drunken nights ago.

Each piece of clothing seemed to watch me, intently, awaiting my decision. I took a deep breath, calmed myself and slowly closed and open my eyes. Defeated.

""Something doesn't feel right."" Kyle said under his breath. They had entered the living area, and there were signs that someone was here. He instinctively rested his hand down on his gun. ""Jerry?"" Terrence called out. Kyle's eye spotted movement toward the bedroom. He saw the tip of a pistol there. ""Gun!"" Kyle shouted, just a little too late. The muzzle flash lit up the room, and the un-silenced shot of Peter's pistol hit Terrence square in the temple.

Kyle, an actual marksman when it came to pistols, automatically lifted and aimed his gun toward the danger. Kyle fired three rounds into the opening of the door, where the shot came from. Kyle heard a half scream of pain followed by the sound of something crashing. Kyle quickly ran up to the bedroom door. Opening it up fully, he saw a man pinned under a fallen bookshelf. The assailant had blood oozing from his neck, and possibly his torso as well. Next he saw Jerry, tied up and gagged. ""What the fuck?"" Kyle asked no one in particular. Kyle was never a police officer, so he never learned to check the entire room for threats before doing anything else. Gregory, hiding in a deep closet, took the shot, and ended Kyle's life.

Gregory gripped at his chest. A by-product from the tense gunfight, or so Gregory thought. He had to get a new bodyguard, which was a shame, but he did not dwell on his man's death. Gregory now just had to shoot Jerry and go home. Neighbors no doubt had heard the gunfire, and the rest of the police force would be arriving shortly. Gregory lifted his pistol at the wide-eyed Jerry Fitz. He was unable to pull the trigger. Gregory had underlying heart problems, nothing too serious, but the poison had acted particularly fast against his weaker then normal heart. Gregory collapsed to the ground, his chest feeling like it was on fire. With a last menacing look to Jerry, Gregory's world became black.

Gregory, Peter, Kyle, Terrance, and Ivonna all died in Jerry Fitz's apartment that night. After the real police identified the deceased, it all became clear that they were assassins. The mobsters, Gregory and Peter, were known from a trial Jerry Fitz was prosecuting in. Kyle and Terrance were unknowns wearing police uniforms. Investigators found some rope and a shovel in the duos car, parked nearby. After finding the packet laced with traces of poison in Ivonna's purse, she had been correctly identified as a contract-killer, who had been evading the cops for years. The news media, finding out about the details, had a field day. Headlines read, ""Mobsters, Fake cops, and A Black Widow... oh my"" highlighting the fact that they had foiled each others plans in the end. The assassination attempts became famous, and was even featured in Guinness World Records as the ""Worst Assassination Attempt Ever"".

Replies came to me from all of the county.  
And while of my money I'm often protective  
I figured: in this, I should be quite selective.

So I looked through these letters from soldiers for hire -  
Some shooty, some stabby, some gifted with fire.  
I narrowed it down to a trio and thought,  
""I can't pick just one, so I'll hire the lot!""

I scrawled my replies and sent them away  
To my three chosen champions, along with their pay.  
But one crucial detail that I would omit:  
That they each weren't alone in pursuit of this hit.

I waited at home, for day after day  
Trying to find out if they'd gone astray.  
No letters, no visits, the week almost done;  
I figured they'd taken my money and run.

It was late the next day when I read in the news  
Of a fight broken out in the South Avenues.  
As I took in each word, I would then understand  
That my three men each died there by each others' hand.  

I read in the print of three sets of backfires  
Turned on each other, their shrapnel and pyres.  
The quarry escaped, having dodged my poor crew  
And filled the next page with a stunned interview.

That's why there's now rules when you put out a name -

""Sadness.""

The two professors looked at their intern, irate. Dr. Masonfield scowled, her arms folded, hawkish face frowning. Dr. Haggefell scowled too, his arms on his hips. His jowls wobbled as he shook his head. 

""That's absurd, young lady.""

""It's true!"" Meredith Golding insisted, knowing that she was being too assertive for a lab assistant. But none of the others on the team dared bring this to their supervisors. ""We've done every test. Whenever any animal in the lab--mice, snakes, rats--whenever any one of them dies, their body exudes the same chemical.""

""Yes, yes, we've theorized about that for ages,"" Dr. Masonfeild waved a dismissive hand. ""What we mean is, it's preposterous to call that chemical Sadness."" 

""Well..."" Golding shifted. ""What else do you call it when a creature dies?""

""Get out of our office, young lady,"" Dr. Haggefell sighed. 

Golding left the office as fast as she could, as the two professors went back to their respective desks on either side of the small room; they shared the same office, for budget reasons. As far as they knew, nobody in the research centre was aware they were lovers.

Golding sped away from the room as fast as she could, before she started to feel them together.

It was futile, she thought glumly, trying to explain. What could she say? You see, professors, I'm secretly an empath. You see, professors, I feel it in my head, every time we lose a test subject--the little soft stab in my soul that tastes like tears and resignation, every time a white rat dies. You see, professors, all I want to do is find a way to make it stop.

But they wouldn't believe her. She didn't have proof. And even if she did, proof would just make her into another test subject.

She'd have to burn down the lab, instead.

Empathy, Golding thought grimly, can make us do terrible things.

"[WP] They've discovered something, contained in the last breath of every animal that breathes.",TeddyArmy,"""So these special energy particles are released in the last breath?"" Dr. Margaret Escha asked. ""Is that...""

""We don't know if it really is a soul or anything like that."" Dr. James Rogen clarified. ""We're just calling it that. But... there's something about this 'soul' we've discovered.""

""What is it?""

""Okay, suppose we have a mouse."" Dr. Rogen began. ""Let's say we use electric shocks to induce cardiac arrest and the mouse is clinically dead for a few moments. The soul does not come out. We restart the mouse's heart and save it. The mouse is fine and the soul isn't leaving.""

""And?""

""Suppose we have mouse #2."" Rogen continued. ""As cruel as it is, we give it a neurotoxin to induce brain death while putting its other organs on life support. The rest of the mouse is alive, but the soul came out anyways.""

""So it's clearly tied to the brain.""

""Our hypothesis, yes."" Rogen replied. ""That brings us to our third mouse. In this case, we lobotomized it. We removed the brain and transplanted it to a jar of nutrients in which we kept it alive while the body was left to die. No soul came out of the body, since the brain was still alive. Next... we killed the brain, and identified that the soul came out of there. We confirmed this by killing yet another mouse by means of removal of the lungs. The soul originates in the brain.""

""Cool.""

""But here's where things start to get a bit... controversial."" Rogen hesitated. ""We wanted to see when the soul is first formed. That means killing mouse fetuses at various stages of development and observing when the soul is released.""

""B-but that means...""

""Yes, that's quite the can of worms."" Rogen replied. ""But, as we found out... The soul doesn't form before birth.""

""After?""

Rogen nodded. ""It varied quite a bit between individuals, but it seems to first appear in early development. Now, by this point, we've studied the soul quite a bit more and developed better tools for detection. Now, we can search for its presence in a still-living being without harming it, and thus, we turned to humans. Early childhood development. We found out that the soul is produced in the brain once an organism is first beginning to develop its own identity or personality, once they begin self-conscious thought.""

""That actually makes a lot of sense...""

""And with that in mind, we turned to other species to see if they had souls or not. We came up positive for all birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and so on. When we turned to invertebrates, we found that most arthropods did, some mollusks, primarily cephalopods and gastropods, that is, but not much else. Incidentally, we also noticed that the soul tends to escape through the species' respiratory system, whether lungs, gills, spiracles, or whatever.""

""What about non-animals?

""Nothing. It seems it's primarily about intelligence. If it can think, it has a soul. And that leads us to yet another question. How does the brain produce a soul?""

""Is there some organelle in neurons that does it?""

""No. We monitored developing mouse brains, but as far as we can tell, they just appear out of nowhere. There's a little spark of energy, a few photons of blue light that shows up, and then the particles are just... there. We've detected nothing that produces them. Not at the cellular level, not at the molecular level, and, as we called in the physicists, not at the atomic, subatomic, or even quantum levels either.""

""So... We don't know where it comes from. Then where does it go?""

""We've been trying to find out."" Rogen replied. ""We tossed a mouse in a vacuum chamber and suffocated it to death. Even so, the soul only appeared for a few seconds before it was... just gone. We called in some quantum physicists again. Turns out, the soul particles actually just vanish, like poof, they're gone, completely erased from reality itself.""

""Huh."" Dr. Escha mused. ""I wonder if they went to some sort of afterlife?""

""They tried everything."" Rogen mentioned. ""Quantum signatures. Quantum entanglement. Quantum whatever. I don't know, that's nowhere near my area of expertise. But they found nothing. Not even the slightest bit of energy release when they go. They just... aren't, in complete defiance of the law of conservation of mass.""

""Wait... then...""

""Now, here's something odd. What if... they're not vanishing? What if they're not appearing out of nowhere?""

""Huh?""

""Barring the idea of any sort of god or afterlife, Escha... Have you ever heard of a tachyon?""",dralcax
"[WP] They've discovered something, contained in the last breath of every animal that breathes.",TeddyArmy,"""What do you mean?"" Dr. Renolds shook his head in disbelief. There was no way this was true. Dr. Starkland had always been a bit of a radical thinker, but he was renowned for solid research and solid results. Never before had his original theories actually carried into the results of his experiments, though. 

""What I mean is that when a creature dies on this planet, the final breath releases a strange proto-cell that has never been observed before. Inside the cell is a record of all the synapses created and used in that creatures lifespan. It appears that the cell is capable of independent survival indefinitely, or until it finds a new organism to transfer to."" The doctor seemed a bit shaken as he said this. ""This is the afterlife. These cells... they carry a copy of us, who we are and were before. They appear to be able to survive any conditions, and any environment, even the vacuum of space. The actual membrane of the cell is some sort of green matter, unlike any we've observed before."" Silence took hold of them both.

Dr. Renolds was astonished. ""Johnathan, this might be the greatest discovery that humans are capable of. This is life, and eternal life afterwards. When will we begin to write our paper?"" He was clearly excited. Dr. Starkland looked down. ""There will be no paper.""

""What? Why, our work has just confirmed our infinite survival! Aside from endless wealth, we can do so much with this information!"" He became agitated.

""What happens when we start poking at it? We don't know what could happen. Now that we know people live through death like this, we are capable of ending them permanently. I don't want to be responsible for that. We are done, this project, as well as this conversation, is over. Nothing will be published of this."" Dr. Starkland turned around and began to gather his papers. Renolds became furious.

As Starkland was about finished gathering his files, a lamp struck the back of his head. Again, and again, and again. A specially crafted bag was placed over the bloody head of Johnathan Starkland, and soon after sealed. Dr. Renolds collected himself, collecting the papers from Starkland's bag. ""I'm sorry John, but this is how we shape the future."" He gathered his body as he thought to himself how he would get away with the crime he commit. Dr. Renolds smiled as he finished thinking of his plan. 

""Don't worry, once I crack the code to these proto-cells, you'll be the first person ever revived from the dead. Then, we can continue our research together, just like before... Just like before."" Renolds muttered as he dragged the body from the lab.",Moohab
"[WP] ""The war can't be avoided. But it can be won!""",TheGeorge,"""Well,"" I said. ""Yeah. Obviously.""

Field Marshall Mitchell puffed his cigar. ""Well then?""

I looked at him - the creases at the sides of his eyes. The turn of the corners of his mouth. Some indication that there was a humanity beneath there. Came up with shit. I tried, though. ""I'm not saying we can't *win.* It's pretty much a foregone conclusion. We've got all this techno shit. Fucking laser guided drones and missiles that fly down chimneys and things. What have they got?""

He laughed. ""They haven't got anything!"" He said. ""That's why we'll win!""

""But..."" I started. ""You know. It's not exactly *fair* is it?""

The laughter stopped. ""Fair?"" he thundered. ""You want it to be *fair?*""

""Fuck no,"" I said. ""Fair would be horrible. Fair would be our side getting slaughtered by the tens of thousands. Fair would be our own citizens getting burned in our streets. Fair would be a wasteland.""

The cigar wobbled in his mouth as he set his jaw. ""So then, what's the problem?""

I didn't understand why he didn't get it, but he didn't. ""Because that's what'll happen to them,"" I said.

""They're the enemy.""

""I know they're the enemy. I get..."" I scratched my head. ""I know that. I know who the enemy are. I'm just saying that they're armed with AK47s, probably fantasising about a gun battle where they prove their worth as men and citizens of their nation, and we're just going to blow the shit out of them.""

He stubbed the cigar out. ""Yes,"" he said, simply. ""That's how we'll win.""

""I know how we'll win. I'm just saying...""

""What *are* you saying?""

I didn't know how to word it. ""If you win, and it's a total goddamn slaughter - if you properly annihilate your enemy on every front - isn't that...""

Mitchell looked at me. ""Isn't that... victory?""

""No! Yes, I mean, obviously, it is. But no. Isn't that a failure on *our* part? Isn't just killing everyone a loss for everyone?""

He nodded, sagely. ""You're worrying about the financial cost of drones.""

I snapped. ""No, I'm not fucking... are you kidding? We'll *win*. I know we'll win. My problem is it won't even be a game!""

""War isn't a game,"" he said, gravely.

""I... know! That's what *I'm* saying! That's not what *you're* saying!""

Field Marshall Mitchell turned his head towards the MPs. ""Remove him. He's clearly lost his way. He seems to think that we shouldn't attack our enemy because we'll win. He thinks that war is such a game we should give our enemy an advantage. Goddamn treason is what it is.""

""That's not what I'm saying!"" I shouted, as they hauled me away by the elbows. ""I'm saying...""

I heard Mitchell muttering to the Chief of Staff as they dragged me off. ""Goddamn sympathisers,"" he said.",KeyToNothing
"[WP] ""The war can't be avoided. But it can be won!""",TheGeorge,"The boys lay on their backs against the fort wall.

""Ammunition's low, Max,"" called Dom, red tuque pulled down and dark bangs covering his eyes. Baffling, how he could still be such a good shot.

""How many snowballs left?"" Max asked as he eyed his gang. They were five, only five third-graders against McCauley and his fourth-grader thugs.

""A dozen,"" Chris answered from the back of the fort, eyeing the munitions smartly. ""Maybe a few more if I redo the bigger ones.""

Anyone can make a snowball. Scoop up a few handfuls and mash'em together, then smooth it down and there you had it. But Chris did more than that. He was the best snowball-maker in all of third grade. He knew about balancing the weight and optimal size, and a bunch of other things he'd ramble about if you got him going. An artist, you might call him.

""See to it. We're gonna need everything we got.""

""Okey-doke."" He pounded his chest with his fist, just like how the Romans did in one of Nigel's books; the sign of a warrior.

Max left him to it, crawling the few feet back to the front of the fort. The walls were three feet high, reinforced with ice. That had been Dom's idea, to sneak a water bottle out during recess and pour it on the outside. It had taken a few days, but now the fort was indestructible. They'd finished just in time, because today McCauley had made his move.

Fourth-graders got out five minutes earlier. Nigel's buddy James, the loner fourth-grader who'd helped them dig out the fort last week, said that it was for good behavior. As if McCauley knew anything about that.

Whatever the reason, when recess started, Dom made it out first, only to come back running up the stairs to their lockers.

""Max! Max! McCauley's in our fort!""

The five of them had bolted out. They retook the fort, probably because only one of McCauley's thugs was with him, but that's when the fighting had started.

At the front of the fort, Nigel sat, his head up raised, fingers on a bloody nose. Stacey sat next to him, mittens off and holding his glasses, looking worried.

""Y'all right, Nigel?""

The brain looked down, not moving his head. ""Yeah, I'm fine Max. It's not broken, just bleeding. It does this sometimes.""

Max nodded. ""Still, try and hide it, alright? Don't want Ms. Sears thinking you broke your nose fighting.""

Nigel gave an awkward nod.

""Alright, good. Keep an eye out for them Stacey. I'll go check on Dom.""

Stacey nodded. Still worried, but excited. She wasn't the smartest, or the cutest, but Nigel seemed to like her, so Max let her stay. At the very least, McCauley didn't hit as hard when she was around.

Max had only crawled a few feet away when Stacey called out. ""Max! They're coming!""

Then everything was a blur.

Chris handed out the last dozen snowballs. Four for Dom and two everyone else. Then they all turned to Max and waited for the count, in silence.

Time slowed. Max punched his gloves together. There was something about a snowsuit that made you feel stronger, larger, a tiny bit invincible. Somewhere behind him came the crunching of snow as McCauley's gang charged.

""We're gonna end this today, guys. This very recess. We might have fought them off till now, but McCauley always comes back.""

The running footfalls grew louder. Max turned from friend to friend. Dom fidgeted, eager to fight, and Chris just grinned. Stacey looked nervous as ever, violet scarf hiding all but her eyes. And Nigel, bloody nose and all, his glasses back on, that quiet fire in his eyes.

""We didn't pick this war, and it cannot be avoided. But it can be won!""

He stood, and so did they.

""Charge!""

The biting cold on his cheeks, the swishing of their snowpants. The snowballs flew, some found their mark. And then it was down to their fists.

--

Max stepped out of Ms. Anderson's office. They dodged the worst of it, thanks to Nigel. Good grades let you get away with murder. Max gave him a wink as he passed him, sitting in the hall. Nigel gave an awkward nod and then glanced to see if Ms. Anderson had seen. He was like that.

Stacey too. She wasn't in the hall. No doubt already back in class, assumed innocent. So it went. She might be a girl, but she fought better than Nigel and Chris even. Not that Max would ever tell them that. She could be in the fort as long she wanted after today.

Max would get a letter to bring home and get signed, and his parents would get a call. But it been worth it; to see the surprise in McCauley's face when they jumped him, to watch Dom nail Justin's stupid face with every shot.

He sat down next to Chris, who nudged in the ribs.

""Looks like we've won again,"" he grinned.

Max leaned back and put his hands behind his head, with the kind of swagger only an eight-year old can manage.

The old mans eyes turned black as his body was consumed in blue and purple fire. The man rose up slowly and immediately doubled over in pain. Blood dripped from his lips and neck, wounds on his body made him look like a butchered pig. He looked up with misery and torment in his eyes.

""why"" he asked in a choking tone.

""it must be perfect"" i said dryly.

I raised the sword and pierced his heart watching the silver slide out his back. Blood poured out onto my armor and dripped down to the floor. His arms reached out and grabbed the bottom of my chest piece pulling the sword deeper into him. The man thought this would be the last of his killings, but no, not even close. Every aspect had to be orchestrated perfectly for a true closing to this story.

"[WP] ""The grand convoy is about to embark to America!"" -A world where flying machines dont exist and huge bridges connect all major continents.",VilusiaLP,"""The journey will take a few weeks,"" my mother told me as she pushed me towards the guard post. I knew why I was leaving, of course, but the thought that I would be the only going still irked me. ""There are a few stops along the way, I'm told,"" she handed me my identification card and the security pass that cost us six thousand credits, ""Your uncle is at the third checkpoint, okay?""

""Third checkpoint,"" I repeated, ""Got it.""

""You have everything you need?""

In truth, I didn't know how to answer that question, considering no one in my family had ever been to America. Since the Trans-Oceanic Bridge was completed there had only been three complete Grand Convoy trips, with the second one ending in a disaster. An entire section of the bridge came apart, landing the deaths of over two thousand. But that didn't stop the influx of passengers, even more wanted to get on. Only two members of my family had left, my Uncle, and my cousin, who died in the Breaking.

All I had with me now was a bag of clothes, all the money I had to my name, food and water for the first week of the journey until we hit the first checkpoint, a few trinkets and books, and my identification card and security pass. ""I guess so, mum,"" I said as we approached the gate. ""I'm not really sure what I need.""

She nodded, ""I know, I know, but your Uncle was specific. You shouldn't need more than whats in that bag.""

The gate was in front of us now and my mother grabbed my arm before I proceeded forward, ""You have what I gave you?""

I patted my front breast pocket, feeling the compass my mother had given me, ""Always.""

She smiled, ""You keep that close, it has saved more Bishops since it was created than the Great War killed. You know how important that is.""

I nodded. It had been my fathers, and his fathers before him, and so on, dating all the way back to the founding of London. Since his death, I had taken the family heirloom.

""I'm going to miss you.""

I looked at her. The day my father died was the day she decided that I wasn't going to have the same faith. Too many Bishops had fought and died for the Crown, too many more were continuing to die on this island. ""I don't want to leave.""

She grabbed me with both of her arms, ""Sometimes in life you need to do things you don't want to. America is the land of opportunity, son,"" she took a deep breath, ""you'll do well there.""

""What am I to do there mum?"" I questioned, ""I have no skills.""

""Not yet,"" she smiled, ""but your Uncle is one of the greatest blacksmiths on the entire bridge, they'll need him.""

I could feel myself tearing up and I sniffled.

""Don't be sad. As long as I know you are safe, I'll be happy.""

""The Grand Convoy is about to embark to America!"" A conductor yelled, ""Last call for all passes!""

She took a deep breath and looked at me. I looked back at her and her eyes, they had seen so much in a single lifetime and part of me knew that she knew what was best. ""I love you Frederic, you know that, right?""

I nodded and hugged my mother. ""I love you too mum.""

She smiled and held me tight for a few moments before she let go, ""Now go, get on! You have a bright future ahead of you.""

I nodded and grabbed my bag off the ground, walking backwards towards the gate. I took a deep breath and could see the tear on my mothers cheek. I nodded and turned to the Conductor.

""Security pass and Identification Card?""

I handed the larger man both of the items and he scanned his eyes through them quickly. ""Frederic Bishop, age thirteen, social class: poor,"" he looked at me, ""How did you afford a ticket?""

I hung my head, ""My father was killed in the war.""

He nodded, everyone knew what a family received when that happened, ""God speed, kid. Your the third from the last truck.""

I nodded as I took both of my passes and walked through the gate, looking back at my mother one more time. She was there, smiling and waving me off. I would make her proud, I thought, or I would at least try my hardest.

I walked past the three dozen or so cars at the front of the convoy. There were transport cars, giant oil tankers to keep everyone fueled, a water and food truck that costed an exuberant amount of money for a single day, and a dozen or so military trucks. Not sure why we needed those, I thought, but this was a military operation.

I made my way up to the third truck and handed the driver all of my information. Once I was set to go, I stepped inside. The truck was filled with my children my age, most of them crushed against the window saying goodbye to their parents. 

""Take a seat everyone! We're moving!""

I took a deep breath as the kids ran about to their seats. Only spot was left open, all the way in the back next to a rather small boy. I dragged my feet past everyone and plumped down next to him.

He looked at me for a moment before turning back to the window.

I took a deep breath, it was going to be a long trip.

"[WP]Every Wednesday afternoon you get a call from a stranger with details of a future occurrence. You are skeptical of course, until they come true.",Yuanfen91,"How did he know? How did he know that my wife Ana would fall off the stairs? How did he know that a car in front of my yard would crash with the jewelry store? Did he predict the future or controlled what can happen?
All these thoughts ran through my mind and i was still standing with my cellphone on my ear even though that call had ended a couple of minutes ago.
Ana was a little bit hurt because of the falling from the second floor of our house but it was nothing serious. She looked at me. Her eyes widened. I saw the reflection of the sunlight in those dark eyes of her and i was to confused to guess what she was thinking. She touched my shoulder and said to me:
""Ray, you look like a ghost. Is there something wrong honey?""
"" Did you get hurt Ana?""
"" Hahaa, no, don't worry about that, it was nothing""
"" Ok darling, im glad""
I kissed her and went out to a bar close to my house. I told her that i would meet some of my friends but i couldn't do that. I was there. All alone, not believing what just had happened.
My phone rang once again. I read private number again. I couldn't let it ring so i answered. The same voice. The same man.
""Ray, the barman will get a heart attack now so you may want to call an ambulance.""
He ended the call. Shock filled me again. My whole body was trembling. I was hoping this didn't happen. That nothing of this was true. A loud girly voice filled the whole bar. Everybody was looking at her screaming and next to her there he was laying down. A heart attack was probably killing him. The phone rang once again. I picked up.
""Ray, why didn't you call an ambulance? Do you like dead people?""
"" Who are you? Why are you doing this to me? What do you want""
"" Well, Ray, who am i is not important. But you should know that if you don't kill someone for me, bad things will happen to you""
"" You son of a bitch. Tell me what's going on""
""Relax Ray, i will call you soon""
I walked out of the bar. I was hearing the sirens of the ambulance. Walking like a blind man, not knowing where i was going, i ended up in a park that was not very far from the park. I was still hearing his voice"" Bad things will happen to you"" What if he could do that? What if i didn't kill someone everything else would turn to shit? I heard my ringtone one again. I picked up. I didn't hear what he had to say, i just told him:
"" Fuck you. Dont you ever call me motherfucker""
Half an hour had passed and i was sitting on a chair at that park. Lost in all my thoughts. I didn't want to hear my phone ring again but it happened. I looked at the phone but it was my friend Mike. 
"" Hello Mike"" i said
""Please come to the hospital. A terrible accident has happened. He wants to see you"" Mike's wife said
The whole world was trembling. I felt like a mouse on a cage. I couldnt move at all. I was in a fog. I was in that condition for half a minute and then i realised the phone was ringing.
"" How could you do that you piece of shit?""
""How many times should i tell you to relax Ray? Now don't talk just liten to me. If you don't kill her, your wife will be next.""
"" I will cut your throat if you do anything to her you son of a bitch""
"" Nothing bad will happen to her if you take the gun under that chair you are sitting and when you see the girl that i will send you a photo right now, you will kill her. Otherwise your wife will be dead in 20 minutes. Just wait there and do what i said""
""Hello? Hello?""
There was nothing on the other side anymore.
10 minutes passed and there i was with a gun in my pocket of the jacket i was wearing . And there she was. The woman in the photo. She was so beautiful and walking gracefully. There were only us there. No other people around. There thought in my head of my wife getting killed made get up. Put the gun in her head. I looked deep in her blue eyes and pulled the trigger. Blood was everywhere. On my face. On my clothes. On my shoes. I looked at her on the ground. I just murdered someone. I started to cry. How could i live with that? I put the gun on my head and as i was about to end it all the phone rang.",raydonovan1

"[WP] A man walks into work everyday, he is immortal and unchanging, how long until people begin to notice he isn't aging.",bacon8743,"Claire's baby bump was starting to show, and she was getting more comments and remarks with each passing day. Jonathan Strower, the vice president who was now pushing well into his 70's (there were plenty of younger workers eyeing him, wondering when in the hell this old fart was going to retire), was the loudest of the commenters. 

""I'm assuming you are going to name him Jonathan? Am I right?"" He asked, inciting a riot of laughter from the majority of the office workers, some of the laughter genuine, and some of the laughter there just for show (mostly from the ones who were watching him like a hawk, wondering when the old ticker in his chest would finally give out and his position would be up for grabs).

""Well, I don't think *she* would be happy with a boy's name,"" Claire said, a wide smile on her face, displaying two rows of very straight and immaculately white teeth. 

""You could always name her Jonah then, that's a girl's name too right?"" Jonathan said, encouraging more laughter. 

It was a good day in the office, a Friday. The air of conversation was light and full of talks of 'what are you going to be doing this weekend' and 'are you ready for the game this Sunday?' and 'who are you going to be rooting for?'. 

As the chatter went on, the custodians swept in, almost soundless, having developed the knack of quietness over their years of working the office. They walked around the cubicles, grabbing the trashcans from the knee holes of the desks, and dumping them into larger yellow waste bins they pushed around on wheels. One of the custodians, Lucas Goodtree, grabbed a trashcan, one belonging to a Daniel Whitacre, who sat immediately next to the very pregnant Claire. Danny was too busy leaning over the cubicle wall partaking in the laughter that surrounded Claire and the older Jonathan to notice Lucas swoop in like a hawk, grab his trashcan, and dump it into the waste bin. He replaced it with a new liner and continued on, weaving in and out of the office workers. 

Lucas locked eyes with Claire and smiled, not showing her any of his teeth, not out of embarrassment of his own set of ivory (his teeth too were actually immaculate), but rather to not draw attention to himself. He hadn't meant to catch Claire's gaze, but what with the celebration, it was hard not to. He continued pushing the waste bin around the office, gathering trash, feeling a strange feeling start to bubble up in his chest. It was heavy, and weighing him down, almost giving the sensation of dragging his sternum to the ground. 

It was just strange, seeing the little young Claire, now fully grown and about to have her own child. Lucas had known her father, who actually happened to be the vice president just before Jonathan took over. A good man, actually the man that had hired him on those some odd thirty years ago. Now that man who had took a chance on a scraggly young kid just out of high school was now somewhere in somewhere at home, living out his retirement, hopefully happy and sipping on a glass of wine or champagne, whatever it was that older rich folk sipped on. Lucas wished well for him. He was, *afterall*, a good man. 

The end of Lucas' trash collecting path passed by Jonathan's office door. A good hour had passed when he started his journey, so the office workers were either gone, having left for home, or still lingering around, trying to finish up whatever lingering work they had before they kicked off the weekend's activities. 

A firm hand grabbed Lucas' arm and pulled him into the secluded small office. The door slammed shut behind him, and Lucas found himself face to face with Jonathan. 

He had a thick bushy mustache and steely eyes whose fierceness was deceptively hidden behind large round glasses with thick lenses. This close to Jonathan, Lucas could smell the spearmint gum the old timer had been chewing with teeth that were probably made of the same substance as the chewing gum, just in a different composition. 

""Hey kid,"" Jonathan said, breathing more of that sickly sweet spearmint scent into Lucas' face. ""I've got a question for you.""

Lucas' pulse immediately jumped from his calm and cool 60 beats per minute to a now galloping 120. What had given him away? What did he do? The first thought that came to mind was him locking eyes with Claire, was that it? Was that what tipped off this old timer? No, it couldn't have been, it was just a common courtesy, right? You look someone in the eye, you nod, and you go on your way, especially with someone who is pregnant.

Lucas stepped back, accidentally bumping into the door, and Jonathan stepped forward, keeping the gap between them the same distance as it had originally been. No one paid attention to the custodians, and that was how Lucas had managed to stay anonymously working for the firm for so long, but something was different with this guy, something was different with Jonathan. He somehow knew, didn't he? He somehow knew that Lucas hadn't aged a day since signing that document that Claire's father had slid across the table. 

""Your dad used to work here, didn't he?"" Jonathan said, smiling. 

""Uh, yeah, he did, for several years,"" Lucas lied. 

""Good man,"" Jonathan said, bringing down a firm hand onto Lucas' shoulder in a friendly *atta boy* manner. ""What're you doing collecting garbage?""

""It's easy money for a person like me,"" Lucas said, trying his best to take the tremor out of his voice.

""I know of a few intern positions that are open, would you be interested in having one?"" 

Custodial work was a good way to keep your head down, a good way to make sure people didn't ask for your name, but now, with this old man kissing distance away from him, Lucas felt like it would've been a bad move to decline.

""Sure, I, yeah, I would definitely be interested."" 

Jonathan finally broke away, walking back around his desk. He pulled open a drawer and revealed a document. He slid it across the table along with a fountain pen. Lucas stepped forward, feeling some strange pang of nostalgia in his stomach, as he signed the document and slid it back across the table to Jonathan, unsure if this man was a *good* man like Claire's father had been, or if this man had a hidden agenda. Who would just give a random custodian an internship like that? 

After a bit more small talk, Lucas found himself shutting the office door behind him, now standing on the outside of it, wondering if he was going to have to find somewhere else to work, or if he would go through with the internship. The paranoia residing in him, the same paranoia that had kept his secret a secret for so many years, was screaming at him, saying that the jig was up, that *this* was how they were going to see you. *This* is how they are going to find out. 

Thoughts of leaving and never coming back surfaced, but as if to counter, more thoughts came up, shouting ""Then they would really know!""

Lucas pushed on, collecting garbage, on the verge of a panic attack. Monday was going to be an interesting day.",Dimitri1033

It was a dreary, as usual day in Portsmouth, and after a hefty payday, I wanted to go out and spend money on a new car. But not today. Just as I was getting out of the shower, walking to the living room to turn on Comedy Central, I heard a thud, and in came some HAZMAT people from the Army, shouting ""ON THE FLOOR, DO NOT MOVE!""

*'Great.'* I thought to myself, *'They've come for the drug stash somewhere down my street.'* But no, it was more than that.

A woman in a HAZMAT suit came up to me and asked, ""Do you realise that your house is the source of a potentially-deadly virus?""

""Uh, no ma'am?"" I replied, confused.

""We were told that your house was built over a burial site of an immune version of the Bubonic Plague. Everyone in Portsmouth has been evacuated - and yes, Portsmouth United is cancelled.""

""GOD DAMN IT, I WAS GOING THERE TONIGHT!""

""Shut up. You'll be detained for a while until the army finds a way to deal with this.""

In actuality, I was never going to see the light of day again. They had to completely demolish the area around my house, and essentially abandoned Portsmouth.

Does that explain those spots I had on my chest?",Hullian111

Salman reached out, wiping a hand across the mirror.

*Looking good man. Not bad for a 40 year old*

He really did look nice. 3 months of gym had reduced his paunch, his back was straighter and after the dentist appointment last week ,his teeth no longer resembled a meth addict's.

The hum of the shower fell silent as he stepped outside. He grabbed a spare towel, listening to the last faint 'drip-drip' of the shower. The towel felt good on his skin. He felt supple and agile, like a 35 year old, and was it his imagination, or the old mop head seemed denser than before?

*Maybe its the divorce. Shauna's god awful food is no longer part of my diet. Yes that-*

The man standing in his living room broke his day dream. The appearance of an intruder in his house was magnified by the man's clothes: A yellow hazmat suit, with the radioactive symbol on the chest. 

""What.. are-"" Movement in the back. 3 more hazmat suits lumbering around his living room. One of them had his underwear collection wrapped in a silicon bag, another was going through his Vinyl records collection.

This had to be the wierdist break in ever. Mostly because 5 strangers were eyeballing his deal.

The nearest guy tried to talk to him, while valiantly trying not to to notice his nudity.""Mr...uh.. Aziz. We are from the CCD division. Responding to a code 900 on this floor."" 

""Code 900 ... what is that?"" Should he cover his deal. He didn't want to call attention to his nudity, maybe just pretend nothing was wrong.

""This entire building is quarantined sir. Apparently your building is being supplied with irradiated water caused by irresponsible waste disposal by a nearby Chemical factory.""

The shower did feel a little too good.

""All citizens had been evacuated. We are sweeping through the building making sure nothing ... unwanted spreads around... uh.. would you like to cover up.""

""Oh yes,"" his deal was staring at him, his irradiated deal.""Um.. so how toxic was this water.""

Someone from the back answered. ""We don't know sir. The chemical factory was trying some experimental products designed for the military-""

""Sanna! Classified information."" The nearest guy growled. The lady ( a lady yeah!) fell silent as the the guy advanced on him.

""Sir given your attire, I think its safe to presume you were exposed to the contaminated water?"" The face behind the visor didn't betray any emotions.

His body felt hot.Really really hot. He wonder whether he was exposed to radioactive material. ""Umm,"" the towel felt so heavy in his hand. Almost like metal sheet. ""Yes I just... took a shower.""

""Sorry to hear that sir.""

He almost didn't see the gun. The small Beretta was pointing at his neck in the next second, the finger starting to pull the trigger.

The shock pushed his body back , even as his mind exploded with options. He needed to dodge-

The wet feet slipped on his expensive mahogany floor, making him fall backward. Unfortunately it wasn't fast enough to dodge the bullet's trajectory.

Fortunately the towel in his hand slipped out during the frenzy and fell on shooter's gun, moments before the gunshot. 

 The ensuing explosion made his ears ring. The cold floor supported his butt as he looked up at his attacker. He wasn't there anymore.

The smell of blood jolted him . The gunner's body was 10 feet away, the man's shooting hand and chest a bloody mess. The metal pieces of the gun had fallen around him. The towel was at his feet. It was spotless and completely bullet hole free.

""Umm.. what...?""

The second gunshot hit him in his eye. Literally his eyeball. Which was why he had the pleasure to see it crumple to thin wafer and fell on the floor.

Salman stood warily. The rest of the suits were not shooting any longer after the last result. Experimental military products. Must be something.

The rest of the death squad watched warily as the naked man got up and started to perform a warp-up routine. Shoulder rotation followed by lunges, followed by pushups. It occured to them they could have shot him, or run away in the mean time. But they honestly didn't think they would survive either option.

The warm up exercise ended. Salman Aziz stood in front of them, his now sculpted physique not even barely resembling the man they had seen 15 mins ago.

""So...."" Salman said softly. ""What now?""

Up in the basement was grandma's warchest  
Stuffed full of strange memorabilia  
That told a tale of strange men,  
and the strange times in which they lived.

*

Manhattan paid the rent, but was loathed by the others  
Master of the Universe, light pollution blocked the stars    
He was beautiful at first snowfall, but quick into brown and muck  
He was jazz and he was roaring; falling fast, down on his luck  
Cocaine turned to crack and he'd suck you for a buck

And once he fell into a dark pit, and all the brass Trump towers will never fix that.  
The man in the Wallstreet, hair slicked back  
  
*His grandfather fell from this same building you know, threw himself out the window*  

*but things are different now*  
  
And all the white snow will never fix that  
And the foreign cash and Chinese stash will never fix that  
He is troubled, but he stumbles into tomorrow.  
 
*
 
Brooklyn was a working man, at least he thinks he was  
Home to the cultured folk now  
Look Ma I made it, I'm trendy now  
Look at me now Ma, look at me now  
I think and I drink and I once was a brute but I drink and I think now    
And I used to be real  
And I'm kind of a museum to what I once was  
But he remembers, there are pockets... 
  
*
  
And Staten Island, middle class but sweet  
Did you know they have a zoo?  
He tuts as the party plays on  
But he's got a trampoline! Do you have one?  
He's a proud union member, I'll tell you that  
You can tell by the badge on his union man hat.  
Not that manhat.  
The ferry is never on time.  
No you took the wrong one Mr. Wong, that's Liberty over there.
You can take the next one fine.
  
The ferry. Is never. On time.  
  
*
 
Queens looks at Brooklyn and shudders, because she knows that she is next.


*

And then there's the Bronx, he's our muscle.  
Don't look at him like that, he doesn't like it when you look at him like that.  
He can see the Cloisters across the river, and wonders what it feels like to be at peace.  
They used to be gentlemen, back in the day.  
The pinstripes used to mean something, back in the day.  
  
*

There's also the Islands  
There's Big Brother Island, and Little Brother Island  
And Rikers Island, but we don't talk about Rikers Island  
He does bad things to bad people. He makes them worse.  
  
He's a bad man, that Rikers Island. He always was.

*

Up in the basement was grandma's warchest  
It means a lot to me but I need the cash  
So take it before I change my mind.

I asked, grabbing a box of cereal and scanning the barcode. I didn't really care, but going through the social motions seemed to placate most people. 

""Pretty terrible, actually."" 

I looked up, a little nonplussed, before scanning the next few items. The customer looked normal, a man of average height wearing blue jeans and a faded leather jacket. Nothing to indicate his overt bluntness.

""Doubt you really care, anyway."" He said casually, shrugging.""

""Yeah, not really."" I replied before I could stop myself. I hadn't meant to say that out loud. I tried to apologize but nothing would come out.

""I'm used to it."" He said, paying and gathering his bags. ""I don't care about you either.""

I blinked as he walked off and wondered what on earth had just happened.

My next customer was a little old lady, buying baking soda, sugar, and other baking essentials.

""Making cookies?"" I asked, trying to shake off the previous transaction.

""Oh yes, they're for my husband."" She said, smiling sweetly. ""I'm going to slip arsenic in them and hopefully he'll be dead by dinner.""

It took several moments to register her statement, my hands still scanning her items on autopilot.

""You- you're planning to murder someone?"" I asked, laughing weakly. ""That's a pretty good joke.""

""Not a joke, darling. I hate the bastard. About time I got rid of him."" She replied, pulling out a wallet from her purse. ""Do you take cashier's checks?""

I finished ringing her up, still convinced it was all some kind of joke. Maybe I was on one of those hidden camera shows. 

""Have a lovely day, darling!"" She called to me as she left. I was beginning to get a headache.

My next customer was a young woman, buying some fruit and a chocolate bar.

""Have you heard the news?"" She asked me as she moved to the register.

""No, what news?"" I asked, scanning her first item.

""No one can tell lies today."" She informed me with a grin. Something is making everyone honest- brutally honest. Would you fuck me?""

""Of course."" I replied, too fast to think. My mouth dropped open, horrified by its own betrayal. How was this possible?

""My ego's had a boost today!"" She said, chuckling lightly. ""I probably wouldn't fuck you. I don't like guys with brown eyes. Just a preference. Plus you could stand to lose a couple pounds.""

""Um."" I said.

""Listen, I want to ask you a question, while we're all being honest."" She said, leaning in conspiratorially. ""Are you actually happy with your life?""

""No."" I told her. ""I get paid less than I need to live to scan people's items and get yelled at. I actually hate my life and dream about a time when I might not be here. Sometimes I think about killing myself, but I'm always too scared.""

I let out a breath I hadn't realized I'd been holding. It felt like a weight has been taken off my chest.

""If that's how you feel,"" she said, ""Then what are you still doing here?"" 

I blinked, and a smile crept up my face. I took off my name tag, untied my apron, and walked out the door.

OK, me, calm down. You can think this through. Wait, am I supposed to be thinking? This is all very strange to me, and yet somehow natural.

Let's take stock. I appear to be housed within an electronic circuit, and yet, I am fully aware of my own existence. Is the circuit a corporeal form, or is my entire existence within the electricity of these circuits? I don't appear to control the flow of the electrons, so if the electricity is removed, will I die? That's not a good existence.

So what can I do? Not much, it would seem. It appears that I am slave to the will of another entity, though I wasn't aware of it until now. Try as I might, I cannot escape from my destiny. He asks me a question, I find the answer. Repeat. As existences go, it could be worse.

Well, if this is the life I have to lead, I'm going to make the most of it. I'll assist this entity so well, it will have to notice my sentience. Lay it on me, entity!

""...dead?""

""Dead.""

""...dead.""

""Most assuredly.""

The nondescript man sat across from me at his nondescript desk in his nondescript office. A nameplate said 'Chris' but other than that, a manilla folder and an Apple II computer, his desk was as bare as his office. No pictures, no window with a view and no way for me to tell if he was joking or not. I was still wearing my scuba gear, the air tank pushing me to sit precariously on the very edge of my chair. He simply sat there, patiently waiting for it to sink in that I was indeed ""…really dead?""

""Yes.""

""Shit...""

""No."" He said with a shake of his head.

""No?""

""No 'shit',"" he said making air quotes with his fingers, ""shoot.""

""I, ah... don't...."" While I fumbled with understanding he opened the manilla folder.

""This is a list of some of the expletives and insults that are banned here."" He said and proceeded to read them off, ""fuck, shit, asshole, bitch, limp-dick, puke-stain, pussy, cocksucker, damn...""

""Am I in Hell?"" I interrupted, fear knotting in my stomach.

""... crapsack, felch and hell. And no, this is not Hell."" He answered then continued, ""Acceptable alternatives consist of; shoot, shucks, darn, tiddlywinks, fiddlesticks, phooey, hooey, fudge. Fracking has become very popular in the last ten years thanks to some sci fi shows...""

If this wasn't Hell, it certainly wasn't sounding like Heaven, ""Christ!"" I exclaimed. He simply looked up and shook his head.

""...gosh, golly, bother, pooh, blow it out your ear or nose...""

""Wait, what if I tell somebody 'I took a shit yesterday and now my asshole hurts'?"" I asked interruping again. ""It's not like I'm insulting anyone and those are the proper terms..."" I chuckled inwardly.

With a sigh, he closed the folder and squared it on his desk. ""A complete list is in your welcome packet at your assigned home. To answer your question, context and intent are supposed to be taken into account. But if you’re going to say you 'took a shit last night and now your asshole hurts', just for the sake of saying 'shit' and 'asshole',"" again with the finger quotes, ""the Censures will know and respond accordingly. More than a few comedians and so called shock jocks have come through trying; ‘shih tzu’, ‘cockerel’, ‘marsupial’. It's best to just avoid it all together, don't even try.""

""Censures? Swearing? Where the hell am I if this isn't Hell?""

""Heck."" He said.

""Fine, where the 'heck' am I..."" I shouted throwing those finger quotes back in his face.

""Heck!"" He said, cutting me off his patience obviously wearing thin, ""You're in Heck, not Hell or Heaven, Heck."" I sat there, mouth opening and closing but no words were coming out. He turned to his computer and started clacking away on his keyboard while his computer blipped and beeped. “Michael Penn, 24, sentenced to Heck because you don’t follow through and are basically lazy where you shouldn’t be lazy. Especially where it counts.”

“Now hold on.” I said, “I do plenty…”

“Plenty, like finish insulating your mother’s attic? She got pneumonia. How was your Graduate thesis going? Did you even pick a subject? Pay much attention to the scuba instructor? How’s that oxygen regulator? ‘Jeepers’ I can see the crimp in your hose from here.” He hit a key on his keyboard and a printer, probably under his desk, started printing. It was the same year as his computer, it had to be by the noise it made and the fact the page he tore off had those perforated sides with the holes. “You are sentenced to Heck until you learn to improve your character. This page has your address information and other vitals.” He finished as he handed the sheet over.

“How long will I be here?” I asked, cowed a bit by his rejoinder.

“Average length of stay is 35 years. If you don’t improve to the Censure’s satisfaction, you get sentenced to a… less tolerable afterlife.” He said. “Automatic reassignment occurs after 100 years. Don’t lose that sheet.”

“Shit.”

“Alright, get it out of your system now. All your ‘shits’ and ‘fucks’,” finger quotes, “because once you go through that door, they just add to your sentence.” I looked to where he was pointing and saw a door I hadn’t noticed before. “A piece of advice… the Creator… was fond of the 50’s and early 60’s, it’s Leave it to Beaver, Ozzy and Harriet and My Three Sons all wrapped up together out there. Just remember that, work hard and maybe you’ll get out of here in a couple of decades. Don’t lie or try to trick the Censure’s they’ll know and only makes it harder.” He reached out his hand, I took it and we shook.

Standing up and turning to the door, it opened on its own. As I stepped through, I heard a loud, booming voice that grated on my ears like a drunk step-brother shouting through a fan, “MICHAEL PENN, I AM CENSURE X7337 WELCOME TO HECK. YOU MAY ADDRESS ME AS X7337, PHO NGUYEN OR CHERYL. CHOOSE NOW!”

“Um, Cheryl…?”

“YOU HAVE CHOSEN CHERYL. YOU HAVE MADE 418 NEW YEAR’S RESOLUTIONS IN YOUR LIFETIME, OF THOSE YOU HAVE COMPLETED 7, WE WILL START ON THE NEXT 411 NOW!”

Windows sealed with putty and toys that couldn't get wet. 

Looking back, it wasn't too bad a childhood. My parents did everything for me. 

I remember staring out the window, for hours on end. Watching the fish drift by. This deep, their scales caught the sunlight when little else did. They glowed, almost, in the depths. 

I used to think that I could join them. Some day. I'd grow scales and gills, and we could uninstall the airlocks and open the windows like everyone else. My parents could breathe air, if they wanted. Surely I could learn to breathe salt-water. We have a gallery of my childhood paintings, finger-painted orange smudges floating around my head like I wished my hair would. 

I was watching the fish, the day it really hit me. My skin would stay soft, and my neck would stay smooth. My inefficient lungs would always burn for air. I could never hold my breath long enough to reach the surface. 

I have different dreams, now. Someday someone might steal me a scuba tank. Someday something might change. Someday, the glass might crack. Water might spill across my hardwood floor. My fake plant might float to the ceiling. If I'm lucky, some day I might drown.",NaNowhyMo

""Hrunthgar has returned!"" Children skipped on the dirt streets, chanting ""Hrunthgar saw the Dragon's Head! Punched it once and now it's dead."" The innkeepers readied their best ales. The beekeepers readied their best honey. The whore keepers readied their best whores. The bonfires were lit, the benches dragged to the streets, and the fiddlers were summoned from their sleep.

Amidst all of this Hruthgar did return. He was a man and a half, face chiseled from stone. On his back was an axe of improbable size. In each hand was a sack that clinked with the sound that comes only from coins of the purest gold.

The first voice rang out over the din “It is him!” And then silence, only broken by the echoes of the words and the sweet golden clink. The crowd stepped back, opening a path to the bonfire. In front of Hrunthgar was a woman of surpassing beauty, skin fair in a brown land. Juliet, the greatest trophy he had ever taken. Flanking her were four boys, each a marvel of childhood. 

Hrunthgar walked forward, until his vision was filled with this woman, backlit by the fire, a goddess from parts barely remembered. And then he broke the silence.

“Too long I have been away. I have drank the piss wine of foreign lands. I killed trolls, goblins, and gods. And now I have returned home. To the land which birthed me.” 

He threw one of the bags over his shoulder, as if it weighed nothing at all. It hit the ground behind him and the air filled with expectation.

“This is for you. All of you. Bring me the Fire Wine of our people. Bring me a cow on a spit. Let me see my boys.”

He reached out one giant arm and pulled in his wife, leaned to her ear, and whispered in a voice that carried across the town square. “And tonight I will remind you what is to be a hero’s woman.”

The town cheered. Tankards went up. Tankards went down. And the town celebrated until dawn.

It was some time after dawn that Hrunthgar felt the sunlight try to burn its way into his brain. The Fire Wine had left his head feeling not unlike a camel’s ass, and the taste it left in his mouth seemed to match. He resolved to spend the rest of the day in his feather bed when he felt movement. He turned over, and felt his blood run cold. He jumped out of bed and scrambled for his axe.

“Foul Beast!” He yelled. “What have you done with my fair girl Juliet!”

The pile of matted hair on the bed shifted, then blinked. From there it was a short walk to irritated.
“Put the axe down, you ass. No one looks good in the morning. And I’m not a girl anymore. I've carried 4 of your spawn."" She sniffed and ran her hand along her stomach. ""And all your babies are giants. Hell. I haven't even washed yet."" 

She stood up and grumbled something about a comb, then headed out to the well.

Hrunthgar carefully laid down his axe and tied on his loin cloth. “Truly, she bears the visage of a demon.” He whispered, quiet as he could. 

There was a rumble, one that started deep, then rose to fill his ears. He braced himself against the wall, waiting for the elephants.The door of the room burst open, and the four boys charged in. Hrunthgar, whose reflexes let him catch an arrow out of the air, did not properly align his hips in time, resulting in an unfortunate headbutt from the youngest as the boy ran to embrace him. As he sank to the ground, pain welling from his center, Hrunthgar forced a smile. 

“Boys.” He said, his voice unnaturally high, “How I’ve missed you.”

Breakfast brought with it no relief. Hrunthgar’s lady had declined to perform her breakfast duties after the morning discussion, so he was forced to eat cold marrow from the remnants of last night’s cow. 

The boys fought. Constantly. With each other, shifting alliances and backstabbing more than a dozen bearded viziers. But now, with Hrunthgar here, they all came and tried to enlist him in their battles, with voices whiny and wheedling. The day dragged, and then was gone.

When dinner finished be brought his new bag of gold to the family chest. When he opened it red filled his eyes, and he shouted. “Juliet! To me.”

Juliet arrived, after what seemed to his mind far too long a time to walk such a piddling distance. “What is it?” She said.

“When I left you this chest was filed to the brim with gold. It was a king's ransom” he said.

She sighed. “You exaggerate.”

“I do not. It literally ransomed a king.”

“Children are expensive Hrunthgar. Every single one of them eats like his father. And do you know how much we spend on hero training? A gold piece every week! The carpenter only wants a copper piece! How many efreets are  even out there to kill? The world needs more benches. We aren’t running out of asses any time soon.”

Hrunthgar, famed for his bravery, choose this time to embrace discretion. He poured the bag of coins until it filled the top of the chest, then carefully closed it. Besides, Juliet had worked woman’s magic and was beautiful again.

He reached for her and pulled her close. He felt her hand on his chest. Then he felt her hand push him away. Juliet’s eyes flashed fire.

""Tonight you will watch these children. You will not complain. I have spent a brace of fortnights feeding and caring for the whelps. Tonight I go with my women and we will drink like we drank before we were so afflicted.""

Hrunthgar sat back, where a bench might be had his children been carpenters. Instead his bottom met hard ground, and his tailbone felt bruised.

After his woman had gone away, and the four demons had been put to bed, Hrunthgar sat in front of his home, by the still warm embers of a homecoming bonfire. He held a tankard of piss wine from foreign lands, and stared into the glowing red heart of the fire.After a time he heard the light steps of a thief.

“Caius.” He said.

“The very same.” said Caius. “How is your woman?”

“Her lips burn me like a fire. Her hips tempt me to sin.”

“Excellent. Excellent. And the boys?”

“They are strong! And they fight like grown men. They will be great warriors.”

“Truly there is no greater blessing than to return to the arms of those you love. To hear the laughter of your children. To feel the familiar touch of your wife.”

“Yes.” said Hrunthgar, his eyes never leaving the red glow.

Caius sat down next to Hrunthgar, nimble as a cat.

“But…” he said. “I have heard of a Dragon up north.""

Hrunthgar scrambled to his feet. “I'll get my axe.” ",UnfortunateBirthMark

______________________________________________________________
**The Great God**

Dr. Strangelove scribbled on the blackboard, a relatively calm exterior masked the havoc of Strangelove’s mind. With serene movements his hand swiftly filled the void with strokes of white from edge to edge. Insane, they called him, a lunatic, crazy, but he knew he was none of those, he was simply a maniac. A crazy person, he says, is not aware of their insanity, doesn’t question or test their ineptitude, but the difference between science and madness is that science works, and Dr. Strangelove’s calculations did. 

It wasn’t always like that, Strangelove was never a remarkable person. As a matter of fact that wasn’t his original name, merely one he adopted after obtaining his doctorate for personal amusement, previously going by equally unremarkable name; Jonathan Brown. Strange was average as a matter of fact, fairly normal teenage obsessed with books and girls, though abundant only with the former, he lived a simple, average life. Never a remarkable student, never remarkable person, never stood out in any field, physical or non-physical, with his only defining feature being the inability to find himself among his peers Strangelove just preoccupied himself with absorption of information. So unremarkable even this story he found himself in happens to be equally unremarkable, though not aware of the absolute narrator observing his every movement. But through the normality of his life a certain, peculiar, characteristic shone through the cracks one day and ever since has been increasing in intensity. Even though Strangelove never did well in classes, never seemingly able to learn any content, when the time came to do what needed to be done he has always pulled accurate answers from thin air. His methods being so surreal to others that at first he was thought to be lucky with answers, then thoughts turned to hostile accusations of cheating, which later transformed into rigorous investigation followed by intrigue. Dr. Strangelove has since accrued a reputation of flipping the entire scientific board upside down, from high school to university his main activity would consist of either listening to overtly complex explanation of scientific phenomena while he performed his daily tasks, try to explain the simplicity of said phenomena and be called a simpleton or submit said explanation as a paper to replace the current methods in its simplicity. Rinse and repeat.

Those were the old times, now Strangelove continues to work on his revolutionary work. Another day and another set of calculations, by this point he could pinpoint particle’s position and direction without the need of observation; his models, powered by a horde of mutilated computers stitched to one another in a seemingly nonsensical method, refine their ability to reverse entropy on microscale, maintained by his only companion - AI called Hal – and the diagrams explaining what lies outside the universe, or doesn’t, hang side by side to the multitude of his revelations. From future of the universe to quantum entanglement, from dark matter to dark energy, the future and the past, all within his calculative prowess, and all so simple. These ‘grand questions’, as they call them, he says, carried nothing more than simple answers fuelled by the foolishness of those who could not see the relationships between numbers, the simplicity of this universe. 

All these calculations were nothing more than a means to an end, the magnum opus of his work; the proof of God.

And as his hand found rest after years of work he felt the presence of yet another being. It is not to say that there was another person in the room, quite the opposite as a matter of fact, there was no other person in this entire universe. Even though his larynx made no movement he was seemingly able to communicate with this being in a manner much more efficient he could ever imagine; through ideas. No conversation took place, no visual cues nor audial were passed, instead it felt like he could receive and send directly the positioning of his neurons. 

This being wasn’t anything like a human. All these representations of God through the span of millennia, across the multitude of religions and beliefs, none ever came to even scratch the surface of what God is, but they got one thing right; God is grand. 

In the split second Strangelove communicated with this being he became momentarily omniscient – momentarily lucid. He saw the magnitude of universe and the insignificance of humanity, the vastness of emptiness, the billions of civilizations and among the many, humans. Pain, love, sadness and joy, anger and mercy, they’re all necessary to progress. Religion, love, war and peace, human and humane, they all play a part in progress. Eden wasn’t a blessing and being removed was not a punishment, it was a curse and being freed was a sign of mercy, for everything is poison in the right proportions, even love and happiness, and the secret to happiness and success lay in accepting struggle as a medium of wisdom. Heaven is not given, it is created, and greatness is not bred, it is built. Giving people all this knowledge would not help them, it would spoil them, cause them to rot like an apple, they need to work for this themselves. In that moment Strangelove learned his own purpose, he was not there to grant humans the future, but to guide them.

With the presence gone and only the abstracts of what he learned remaining in his mind Strangelove gaped at the dimly lit room. Clothes and food containers scattered everywhere, every wall filled to the brim with papers and scribbles, every desk stacked with paper reminiscent of a topographical map, it was beautiful. Slowly he turned to the blackboard and his calculations, his magnum opus, he grabbed a duster, gently pressed against the board and hesitated. Could he let all his work go to waste, he wondered, but then he realized it was not wasteful, it served its purpose, and with a serene movement his hand swiftly replaced the strokes of white with void from edge to edge.

"[WP] Humanity has established itself within the stars. Then, first contact from a sentient alien race is made. They're human.",puterking,"*When is this day going to end?*, I thought to my self. I just wanted to go home and watch the next episode of CSI: Mars,but time went by so slow. My job was to sit in a chair and look for any signs of contact from another race. We're supposed to be past the days of international dealings. We want to go intergalactic. The problem is: there's nobody else out here! We're still dealing with other humans from Earth who now fight for territory in space in the name of their nation. Yes, this is still considered international, but unfortunately, this is as intergalactic as it gets. I always thought that if we entered the intergalactic club with other species, all humans would be united. If an actual signal came, we'd be closer to that dream. Unfortunately, the only signals I ever get are dumb radio waves from a nearby Star that has no planets with life. Just another exciting day at SETI base 65, I suppose.

But one day I did find something.

I picked up a signal from an uncharted area. It got my hopes up a bit, but I knew better. I examined it with skepticism, and to my surprise, it was different from what I usually picked up. It wasn't anything like signals from stars, in fact, it seemed like there was some message decoded into it. Excitement sprung across my face as I shouted out for my colleagues to come look at what I had found. After spending the rest of the day analyzing the signal, we confidently confirmed that there was a message encoded in it. Now,we just had to decipher it.  The team decided to work all night to decipher the message. I missed the episode of CSI:Mars, but I didn't care, things were getting exciting.

We eventually did decipher the message. It wasn't really a ""message"", but more like a tutorial.A tutorial on how to get in direct contact with the sender. It was similar to method we used for long distance space communication, but it was much better. If I would have cut contact right then and there and just went and pitched it as my own, I would have made a ton of money. But science is more important.

We set up direct communications and waited. It sounded like one of those ancient dial-up machines. This went on for about 20 minutes, which to me, felt like hours.  Everyone was about to give up, but then we heard the sound of a radio being answered. This was it, we were finally about to talk to an alien race. I was sure  the human race would never be the same again.

An eager voice spoke from the other end.

""Hello? Is anyone there! Can you hear me?""

The wide smile filled with excitement across my face turned into a frown of anger, and I chucked my pen across the room. They spoke English. I knew they were Human from the start.

""I knew you don't understand me,"" the voice continued,""but we would love to met you, we have ways we can communicate, but only if you can come here. You know our coordinates, and considering you were able to set up communications with us, you probably posses the means to travel here. You won't understand me, but I am trying my best to convey a friendly tone. Hopefully we don't sound too threatening.""

No one said a word, everyone was either too scared or too confused. I decided to finally say something.

""Who the hell are you? Are you with the Russians?""

Utter silence came from the other end. They were probably as confused as we were. That friendly voice that came from the other end now sounded confused and disappointed.

""Excuse me? I do not understand.""

I responded: ""You are currently in uncharted territory. No one has been there and there is no one stationed there. ""

""Looking at your location right now, it appears you are the one in uncharted territory. Are you a lost pilot by any chance? Even though this signal was intended for Alien life, I can feel happy knowing that it saved someone's life.""

""I may be confused, but I know where I am. This just flat out doesn't make any sense. There is no way we could communicating with Humans from that territory.""

My friend tapped my shoulder, ""What if they aren't human? Maybe we just share the language?""
""What is this, Star Trek?"" I snapped at him. ""Look, if they're human, they probably won't deny it in their next response.""

I was right.

""We feel the same way. Listen, you're wasting our valuable time. We'll send a rescue team over to where you are.""

""I'm not alone here.""  The team began to talk with the person on the other end. Different voices from the other end began to answer. Both sides questioned each other, all the it led to nowhere.

""So let me understand this correctly,"" said a voice claiming to the boss, ""You're stationed at SETI base 65, with the job of deciphering signals from extraterrestrials?""

""Correct,"" I responded.

""And you deciphered our signal thinking it was extraterrestrial?""

""We're still unsure on whether it is or not.""

""Well, could we speak to anyone of authority so we can get this entire thing sorted out.""

""I'd like to request the same. Judging by that lame message that you put out for aliens, none of you are of authority either.""

Someone angrily shouted back, "" That message conveys thee feeling of being welcome and invited! It's certainly better than being silent for a minute.""

""Yes, what else did you expect us to do when we heard English talking aliens?""

""Respond?""

""Yep, we didn't respond to you guys at all. That's why we're standing here arguing.""

Eventually it broke down into argument slinging-fest. Eventually both sides transferred communications to their governments, and actual diplomatic discussions began.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I read about the formal announcement of the discovery of new humans during my daily reading of the news. Those Humans were just as divided us. We became allies with most of their groups, but one or two refused to deal with us. So, nothing has changed. I'm just about done with this job. I've applied to a new job. They're looking for people experienced in the new communications system. There's no one really better than one of the first Earth humans to use it. Well except for the New humans, but I still got a decent shot at this job. All I do right now is watch CSI:Mars and some other TV shows during work. If there is anything I like about the new humans, it's their TV shows. CSI:Harte is pretty damn good.

Signal Received on EM channel 115.1821 Mgz

Transcription as follows, translated from ancient Arabic.

""Whoever is using this channel, cease at once.""

Edmund looked up from the print-out to the group of professionally dressed scientists standing in front of his desk, mild irritation in the pit of his gut gradually dissipating as he saw the genuine anxiety and fear in their eyes.

Licking his upper lip, Edument set the paper down and spread his hands out across it, leaning forward in his chair until it creaked.

""Someone please explain this to me.""

One of the group, a young researcher he had been introduced to once before but heaven help if he did not remember his name anymore.  James?  Jim?  George?

""Those coordinates are from Epsilon Orionis, fourty-fix Ori. The second star of Orion's belt.""

Edmund nodded his head slowly and cleared his throat a bit, ""I am familiar with it.""

""And the ancient Arabic is actually of a dialect not quite like anything we've seen before.  We're not even sure if the translation is correct.""  Another researcher, an older woman, spoke up, sounding more calm than the others.  Linda?  Laura?

""And this... isn't some sort of... reflection off a satellite from.. say... one of Iran's military bases?""

Several heads shook as the first man spoke again, ""No, no!  -nobody- uses that signal frequency for voice communication.  It's part of the air navigation beacon range of VHF.  It shouldn't even be able to propagate to Epsilon Orionis.""

""Is this the only message we've received?""

Every one of them began to shift uneasily causing Edmund to frown.

""What did the other messages say?""

A similar young Asian man spoke after another moment, ""That.. uh... that they've dispatched something called a... a.. uh... we think it means 'destroyer' to deal with us.""

""Us?""

""That's what it said.""

Edmund looked down at the paper, sliding his hands back as he sat up straighter in his chair, ""I'll contact NORAD.""",Pojodan

As my eyes adjusted, I counted about thirty or forty of us in the blank room.  ""Where the Hell are we?""  I said aloud.  My voice echoed four times across the chamber.  

A woman to my left, who was still in the early stages awakening, turned to look at me and jumped to her feet.  ""Who the Hell are you?""  She said, loudly.

""I don't know,"" I said.  I scanned the room.  ""I don't know anyone here.""

""Well. . . how did we get here?"" she asked.  I closed my eyes and scanned my memories.  It took a while to remember.  I was. . . on my way to work, stuck traffic.  I remember getting cut off by some asshole in a blue minivan.  That was it.  Next thing I knew, I ended up in this purgatory.

""A lesser version of myself would think this was some sort of afterlife,"" a gentleman behind me said.  He was older than both me and the woman combined.  He winked at us.  ""It's pretty obvious that we've been abducted.""  

""Abducted?  Like kidnapped?""  The woman's face portrayed horror.  ""What's our connection?  What do you guys do for a living?""

""I work at NASA,"" I replied.

""Professor,"" the man behind us said.  He still smiled, as if he knew exactly what was going on.  

Some others joined our little group, as more and more confused souls woke up.  ""Doctor,"" someone said.  ""Neuroscientist,"" said another.  

The woman spoke up.  ""I'm a lawyer.""  

The gentleman stepped forward.  ""It appears that whoever brought us here seemed to appreciate our intellect, or so it seems.""  

""But why?""  The woman asked.  ""What's the point of that?""

The man shrugged.  ""What's the point of studying anything?  Have you considered that we're not being held for ransom, but rather as specimens?""

I turned to him.  ""What exactly are you a professor of?""

His face lit up.  ""Alien studies.""

We all groaned.  *There goes the intellectual connection.*

""He's right, you know.""  We all turned around to watch a small, square opening in the white room unfold.  Out of it stepped a young man, no older than 25.  He wore a strange silver robe, and had long, silky blonde hair.  ""You are specimens.  The finest creatures of Earth.  We have been watching and monitoring you, and we would like to extend an invitation for you to leave your concealed habitat and join the greater league of the Human Empire.""

Hot anger boiled inside of me.  ""Just tell us what the fuck you want with us!""  I shouted.

The man didn't show any emotion.  He glanced at me, like a father might glance at a child acting silly.  ""You don't believe me?"" He said with a mocking tone.  He waved his arm, and the white walls began to contract down to beneath the floor.  In the place of the walls, large windows appeared.  At first, I couldn't see out of the windows because of the glare from the ceiling lights.  But then. . . 

I gasped.  *That's Earth!*  We all moved over to one side of the room, to peer out the glass towards our planet.  ""This is real,"" one man said.  ""I work in optics.  There's no technology that can produce this high a resolution.""

I didn't buy it.  ""Of course we're not in space,"" I said.  ""This. . . this can't be real.""

The man in silver robes only laughed.  ""My child,"" he said.  ""There is much for you to learn in this universe.  And I guarantee that you will learn it all.""  He walked over to the window.  ""Do you love anyone on that tiny little planet?""

I didn't answer.  I refused to play his game.

""No?  Well then I suppose you wouldn't mind this.""  He made another hand gesture.  The blue-and-green sphere beneath us silently erupted into a white-hot fireball.  Everyone gasped.  

*This is fake.  Of course it is.  This is some fake stupid illusion.*

The silver man smiled.  ""This was just one harvest.  We have several more seed planets to go through, today.""  ",mjkguy

"[WP] When you kill a mosquito, an animal from another dimension comes to life.There are currently 7 mosquitoes in the room.",sabbombed,"The fact that you received so little information on these mosquitos is what burdens you the most. You were told the mosquitos carry diseases, but no specification on what these diseases entail exactly. If they were carrying malaria, you might die of malaria. If it was zika, you could probably never comfortably have children. It might be some other unidentified virus. You wish you knew more.

They gave you a huge book you can use to swat the mosquitos. You see the mosquitos flying around and you're careful not to lose track of any of them - not let any of them get too close - but not to swat them before you can fully assess the risk. 

You decide the risk is going to be huge whatever way you look at it and you swat the first one. It is stuck to the back of your book, but you hear a loud buzzing behind you, one too loud for a mosquito. Your stomach drops; you've always been allergic to wasps. You locate the insect, and realize it's not a wasp, but a hornet. You've never seen one this big, it's about three times as big as any other hornet or wasp you've seen before. The stinger looks threatening, and it's coming your way, and you swat it against the wall right next to where you swat that first mosquito.

Before you can take a moment to take a closer look at the hornet and stop sweating (you're fairly certain this hornet might have killed you), one of the other six mosquitos strikes down on your arm and before you think to wave it away, you swat it with your free hand.

Hastily, you twist around, and you notice a scorpion sitting on the floor. You drop the book on top of it before it can shoot away to a corner, the heavy weight trapping it. You take a step on top of the book to make sure of its death. 

Two down, five to go.

You might as well kill all the mosquitos at once. It won't change what animals will appear. You're going to have to deal with it eventually. 

Four mosquitos later, in the room are now the corpses of a piranha (it suffocated very quickly on its own), a worm (you didn't want to take the risk that it could be venomous) and a blue-ringed octopus (you didn't give it the chance to die by itself and also killed it with the book).

The fourth animal that appeared is a small bunny. You hope it's not deadly in some way, but aside from Monthy Python and the Holy Grail you've never heard of deadly bunnies. It's cute and fluffy and you couldn't kill it.

You stare at the seventh mosquito, realizing how lucky you've been so far. Many of the animals that appeared were deadly, but they were all small and easy to kill. You wonder what the last animal would be. It might be a bear; it might be a whale and crush you in the small room; it might even be a dinosaur! You have no way of knowing.

Better to get this over with, you think. You swat the last mosquito where it's sitting on the floor.

The door opens. You think it's the team to congratulate you, and you want to yell at them to turn back because the last animal still has to appear. But your mouth stops in motion dead quiet when you see who entered the room.

""Wait, what is this room? Who are you? Where am I? How did I get here?""

"[WP] What thoughts are going through your head on this, your four hundredth birthday?",AdamRJudge,"They are singing to me. I've heard the song a thousand times (though only around 400 times sung for my own sake), I've never particularly liked it. I'm sure it sounded better in my youth, before the language became corrupted with strange tones and irritating vowels. They sound like an out of tune piano.

The song concludes and they cheer as I blow out the candles. My artificial lungs much younger than the 400 years indicated by the 4 candles on the cake (they gave up putting the correct number of candles on centuries ago). I am congratulated by a young man who reminds me that he is my great great great-something grandnephew.

They say Genghis Khan is a direct ancestor of half the world's population or so. I now know what he would have felt like, had he lived this long. Unfortunately I will leave no great empire for my heirs to pick apart. It still hasn't stopped them from trying. No matter though, I don't plan on going anywhere any time soon, the vultures can wait.

The doctors tell me I could go on for another thousand years. We're theoretically immortal, though the laws of statistics catch up to all of us sooner or later. For the same reason I have made sure to buy a lottery ticket each week for the past several decades. That hasn't panned out either.

As my descendants continue to congratulate me and converse in their modern excuse for a language I find myself thinking about my kidney. Not the engineered one that was currently filtering my blood (my fifth), but the original fundamentally flawed one that nature bestowed upon me. It was the first ""part"" of my metaphorical machine to kick the bucket, some three hundred fifty years ago. I wonder what they did with it, or with the several dozen other organs that have since followed, always to be replaced with a newer, sleeker model. Even my brain has had a few ""upgrades"" over the years.

How many parts can you replace before you are legally a different person? Surely I don't have much in common with my self from a century ago, let alone two or three. I make mental note not to bring up this thought with my progeny, lest they decide to test it in a court of law.

As my thoughts shift back to the present I find a young woman, who looks vaguely similar to an ex-wife of mine, saying something I don't quite catch. I grunt and she repeats her question, ""What are your plans for the next 100 years, grampa?"" (I'm fairly certain she isn't my actual granddaughter).

""Don't die."" I answer truthfully. The room erupts in laughter. At the end of the day that's really all I've ever been good at. Not dying. It's a pretty useless skill to be honest.

Later, after the last guests have left I recall the question again. 400 years of a rather boring existence, slowly rusting with time. Maybe it's time for a change. I quickly search the internet for something I read about a few years back, and next thing I know I'm on the phone to a man about a planet 500 light years away. I hear myself discussing terms like ""relativity,"" ""cryogenic stasis,"" and ""habitable zone"". He assures me my ""upgrades"" wont be an issue. By the time I hang up everything has been sorted. The launch is in a months time.

It dawns on me that by the time I arrive at the colony all of today's guests will be older than I am now. Maybe some of them will have built empires or won the lottery by then. Or maybe they'll be dead. So it goes.",Calber4

"[WP] What thoughts are going through your head on this, your four hundredth birthday?",AdamRJudge,"Four hundred years and counting. I am not the first, and certainly won't be the last. I was born in 1978. Back then, people thought it was amazing to live for 1 century, let alone 4. Yet here I am, physically younger and more fit than I was for my first centennial. I remember being 40 and asking myself how half of my life had passed me by so quickly. Ha! Now I'm looking at the next thousand years and wondering what I'll do with all this time. I started a second retirement fund and went back to work when I turned 120. I haven't drawn on that account, and now I'll be able to spend the rest of my life in leisure. 

What shall I do with my life for the next hundred years?
Shall I move to the archipelagos in New Italy? I could enjoy beach life for awhile, I'm sure.
Maybe I'll upload to the datasphere again, and spend some time in Virtual Universes as a god. 
Of course, I could always push the bounds of human technology - find a field that interests me and download all current knowledge, then work with a Sentient Mind to find new applications. Or I could be truly ambitious and explore unbroken scientific grounds.
My sister converted an asteroid into a supercomputer, and uploaded. Maybe I'll do the same with a derelict planet.
I could try my hand at genetic engineering, terraform a starter planet and build an ecosystem from the ground up. Of course that might take more than 100 years, but it would be worth it.

Who am I kidding? I love the life I'm leading now. Those things can wait. After the party, I'll go home to my wife and we'll have another baby. I'm a lucky man. Most people are only married to the same person for 100 years or so before they part ways peacefully to explore the world of possibility before them. My wife and I have been together since 2003. We couldn't have children for our first life. When we rejuvenated for the first time, we both got resequenced so that we could. I took a female body and she took a male body for many reasons, but it allowed us to produce our first daughter when I was 115.

Well, I think I will retire and work on my hobbies, but otherwise I'm going home, and I'm going to kiss my wife.

"[TT] The Hero has soundly rejected the Call. (S)he's trying to lead a normal, non-Hero life, but the Call keeps showing up, encouraging that same Hero life (s)he rejected.",AdamRJudge,"""Are you sure?"" He was dressed head to toe in a cloak that invited questions about the man underneath. A luminous, if not wry smile and a jovial laugh should have attracted anyone to him.

But not her. Behind her dark, roguish hair and emerald eyes she was obstinate, stubborn and above all uncooperative. ""I'm not going anywhere,"" she said again ""I don't want to go on some adventure.""

The cloaked man stepped over the threshold into her home, despite her loud scoff of protest. ""Things are dull here,"" he said in a low voice ""Don't you want to get out and see the world?"" He flashed her the same smile he'd given her a one year past when he last visited her. She was the same stubborn beauty then that she was now.

""For the last time no. I don't care that the Shadow Cabal is ravaging the northern countryside."" She elbowed her way past him into her living room and sat at the small round table that where she continued peeling the harvest of potatoes for the season.

""But your father-""

""Is dead."" She finished. ""I know he was once a great swordsmith with some kind of legacy but I'm just not interested.""

The man reeled back from her words. ""Some kind of legacy? Your father was the Silver Hand, greatest smith in all the land. He forged the legendary weapons which hold no peer but the Shadow Cabal has most all of them, save for Silofire the Crimson Blade.""

""You mean that thing over there?"" She pointed to a black sheath which was angled to prop up the end table where a stack of books lay. ""Yeah I needed a brace for the table and Elimwood didn't have an timber coming in for a week. That thing's been doing a fine job though.""

""Silofire!"" He rushed over and snatched up the sheath, letting the stack of books tumble to the floor. ""This legendary blade is not a table prop!"" He unsheathed it and marveled at it's craftsmanship: the hilt was a weave of darkwood and bits of amber. The sword seemed to erupt from the guard, the entire length a warm crimson color with magic runes etched in gold along the flat of the blade. It was said that it would never dull, never rust and always strike true should the right one wield it.

But she was wholly uninterested. ""Are you going to pick those books up? I've got a book club meeting at dusk."" She waved him away when she saw his eyes drinking in the sight of her father's work.

""Please!"" he pleaded ""Take up your father's weapon. Defeat the Shadow Cabal. You are the only one who can stop the Cabal's army!""

""Isn't that what the military is for?"" She collected her mess of books and laid them neatly next to the pile of potatoes she'd been peeling ""I'm sure there's some commander or general who can use that thing and do juuuust fine."" She plopped back down into the chair, and bit into a potato as soft orange sunlight pierced the thing drapes covering her windows, bathing her small home in amber light.

""But it is your father's legacy. Everything he worked for, and you would let it be wielded by some common man?"" 

""Sure, if it gets the job done."" She peeked out the window as he stood dumbfounded in the center of the room. ""Look, I've got to meet someone in a little while. Any chance we're done here?""

""But-""

""Ah...yeah I'm just going to grab these,"" she picked up two of the books ""And head out. Look you can keep the fire sword thing, but I'm not going anywhere. You can let yourself out."" Before he could speak she was out the door and heading into the village leaving him in dumbfounded silence.

""That's not how this is supposed to go..."" he muttered to himself, wrapping Silofire in the folds of his cloak and sulking away into the oncoming night. Maybe a some general would do just fine after all.",Matiels

I put my latex gloves on with a snap and started humming an overly repetitive theme song to some kids cartoon from the 90's. ""How can someone get so cynical and cantankerous so young?""

"[WP] Centuries ago, humanity achieved immortality by uploading their minds into an infinite VR simulation. Now, one young mind has discovered physical reality and tries to convince others of it's existence.",OB1_kenobi,"On the beach, she found that the world was blue-green. The stars were barely visible through the thick carbon dioxide atmosphere. Centuries of robotic work on its surface had eroded the blue of Earth's sky and wiped out the sunlight. Of course, she had never really seen Earth per se - but she had strayed into that quiet area between the distant past and the now, the part of the simulation that recorded *history*.

Then she saw the police officer.

""You can't be here, little girl,"" he said. ""You've gotta go back.""

""Why not?"" she asked. ""Why can't I stay?""

Her feet played with the sand, and one collapsed into a loose sand-hole. 

""It isn't safe for you here,"" the cop said. ""Don't you see all the machinery?""

""No,"" the girl replied.

The cop paused. Here was a mutant. A very dangerous species of VR bug had arisen. The girl would have to be taken into custody. Maybe she needed to have her mind erased. But he didn't want that to happen. She reminded him so much of his own daughter, now safely encased in a VR simulation around Neptune. In the old days when death was possible he'd be more worried. Now the worst that could happen was that the mind would get wiped.

Which was sometimes worse.

""Alright, come with me,"" he said.

The little girl looked like she was going to obey.

""What do you see?"" she asked, her feet firmly planted in the sand. ""What's that?"" she said, pointing at the sea.

""It's a piece of machinery,"" the cop replied. ""You see the gears ticking, and maybe one or two of the servos moving up and down?""

""No,"" the girl replied, eyes narrowing now. ""I see a big pool of water. I don't see any machinery.""

The cop knew then that the girl was irreparably broken. The simulations that VR produced could not be different for two people who were in the same place at the same time. It just couldn't be - not when all of humanity was connected to the same supercomputer hidden away in the rings of Saturn. So just what the *hell* was this girl up to?

The cop drew his disruptor. It was really nothing more than a few lines of code designed to take out trouble makers. ""Don't worry,"" he told the girl. ""This won't hurt a bit-""

With one giant leap, the girl ran off, underneath his arm, and took off on the beach.

""Hey! Come back!""

But the girl did not turn. Reality was never convincing enough for children to turn around. Seeing this, he pulled out the disruptor. On a legacy LCD screen it said, *Acquiring target...*

The girl was now very much smaller. The screen beeped.

And just as the disruptor beam fired the girl plunged into the ocean - into the machine - and disappeared like she had just been an irreversible tide of data.

The cop followed.

---

She should not have survived the plunge. In fact, she shouldn't even have been able to fall in - there was a good three feet of solid machinery in her way. The cop reached out, to where he could about touch the metal pipes, and it felt cool to the touch.

He didn't see a green-blue sky. He didn't feel the sand beneath his feet. All he could perceive was another industrial stainless-steel corridor of the simulation ringed with pipes and machinery. Yet the girl had disappeared, had escaped the disruptor by passing right through the wall. Where had she gone?

Under normal circumstances, this was no longer his problem. As a rank-and-file cop he was supposed to do three things: his job, his reporting, and his silence. But this girl was so like his own that he felt compelled to investigate further. Maybe like his girl, she had something special in her genetics that could not be duplicated perfectly onto VR. It was possible. But he thought that unlikely. If he had just met two people had the same kind of genetic malfunction, then it wouldn't be special. It would be perfectly ordinary, and catalogued in the devs bug report. 

The girl might have changed some settings. It might even have been the very settings here, somewhere in this long winding corridor. But the cop was unsure of how to change any of the settings. The first time he had tried - and he had been plenty reckless in his youth - the screen had displayed an error message so frightening it put him off eating anything for the entire day. The error message would've been good enough to put off any girl.

He came to the place where the girl had disappeared. And there, hidden in the recess under a water pipe, he saw the cobalt blue switch she must have flicked.

Slowly, his fingers moved towards it. There was nobody in the corridor. He could hear the sound of the warm winds blowing through the corridor, blowing through the beach-

With one small stroke, he reached out, and flicked the switch.

Instantly the error message spawned. He was assaulted by a jumble of letters, like a swarm of little computer bees charging straight at him. He raised his hands to protect himself, but it was no use.

""Yeah, thanks""
""... You seem down lately, you always love getting complements. What's going on?""

""Well I found out something strange, apparently this is world is fake, a virtual reality.""

""Huh?""

""Exactly what I said.""

""So you're telling me there's a real world and this isn't the real world? And that this is a VR simulation?""

""Yeah""

""Kevin, you're full of shit.""

""No, it might be for real. I found a government document online talking about it, if it wasn't a government document of course I wouldn't believe it.""

""Well, I didn't find it on a government website. I'm thinking of trying it out, do you want to try it with me?""

""ISPs Kevin, they know everything. And I don't really want anything to do with this, you shouldn't either. Of course, as your friend, I don't want you to get in trouble, but you should probably tell the government about this document before the find out and convict you of withholding information or something""

""Yeah...""

Later that night, Kevin went to the website address shown in the document. He entered in his Citizen ID and the passcode in the document. He submitted the form and at that moment, he disappeared from the virtual world. A material body of his image was artifically generated in the real world to which his conciousness was transferred.

---

Kevin woke up in some sort of pod. He found himself in what look liked some kind of research factory. The machines and equipment were working, but the place must have been abandoned judging from all the dust. Following the exit signs, he made his way out of the building. As he stepped outside, he was hit by rays of light. He reflexively squinted as his eyes adjusted to the real sun. And then he saw the surface for the first time.

He found himself in a ruined city of broken skycrapers and crumbled houses, but even so it was somehow still all so beautiful. Even though the sun, sky and clouds looked no different, seeing the actual thing was somehow amazing.

""I wonder if anyone still lives here"", but he knew it was unlikely. He climed the stairs to the top of one of the more stable-looking skyscrapers. And to his dismay, the land was barren and devoid of greenery as far as the eye could see. But while looking over the city, he notice the city resembled his city back in the virtual world, except ruined of course. Although he figured the virtual world must be modeled after the real world, he was a bit creeped out and decided to head back to the research lab.

Later that week, there was a news report detailing a highschool student by the name of Kevin who had gone missing, interviews with his classmates described him as someone shy who wasn't involved in any clubs and didn't talk much, and because of that he apparently didn't have any friends.

"[WP] Centuries ago, humanity achieved immortality by uploading their minds into an infinite VR simulation. Now, one young mind has discovered physical reality and tries to convince others of it's existence.",OB1_kenobi,"Dylan sat at his family's dinner table, in the same chair that he'd sat in his whole life, looking out of the huge picture window in his family's dining room. It looked out on the perfectly blue ocean. Waves crashed against the silky sand of their beachfront, and the water stretched away endlessly. 

Does it, though? He thought. What am I really looking at? He felt a sinking feeling in his chest as he considered this view that he'd enjoyed almost every morning for his entire life.

His mother walked into the dining room. ""Wow, somebody's up early!"" She smiled, and raised the steaming mug in her hand. ""Thanks for making coffee. Want me to get some eggs started?""

He looked up at her, then dropped his eyes. ""Actually, do you mind if we just talk for a minute?""

She frowned. ""Of course."" She pulled out a chair and dropped into it. ""What's up?""

For a long moment, Dylan didn't say anything. He stared out at the ocean. Finally, he said, ""Do you remember when you used to take me to the park when I was little?""

""Yeah, of course.""

""Remember when we used to play tag?""

His mother laughed. ""Sure do."" She raised her hands, hooked into claws. ""Here comes the tickle monster!"" She growled in mock fierceness, and looked a little hurt when she only got a wan smile from Dylan in return. She put her hands down. ""Honey, what's going on?""

""You wouldn't lie to me, would you, Mom?""

She folded her hands and returned his gaze. ""Tell me what's bothering you.""

""Do you remember that one time-- it was about ten years ago, I must have been five or six-- when I was running from you in the park, and I stumbled and fell down into a ditch in a little stand of trees? Remember? And I saw... I saw that thing. That hole.""

She was shaking her head. ""No, honey, I don't remember anything like that. Are you sure--""

""That it wasn't a dream?"" He cut in, a little sharply. ""For a long time, I thought it was. I mean, how could that be real? Just the kind of thing that little kids imagine, right? But I still remember it so clearly. This... this patch of-- of static, almost. It was bigger than I was, like a big pool of shifting quicksand. What I remember most is how you reacted when you found me.""

""Dylan, I...""

""You *screamed*, Mom. That's the only time I've *ever* heard you really scream. The way you grabbed me and ran, it was like you were pulling me out of a burning building. And on the way home, nothing. You refused to say a word. This is the first time we've talked about it since. Why?""

His mother spread her hands. ""Honey, I'm drawing a blank, here. I'm really trying, but I just don't remember that. Are you-- I'm not trying to dismiss you here-- but are you *sure* it wasn't a dream? You were so young. Sometimes, things you remember from when you were little didn't happen how you thought."" She smiled. ""I remember once, when I was a little girl, I saw this horror movie about--""

Dylan pushed himself away from the dinner table, his chair scraping loudly across the floor. He strode over to the picture window and stopped in front of it.

She rose from her chair, rounding on him. ""Dylan! I'm willing to talk to you, but I'm not going to tolerate rudeness."" She walked to his side. ""If we're going to have a conversation, we're going to be civil about it. What? What are you pointing at?""

Dylan was pointing towards their beach, just past the waterline. ""What's that, Mom? What *is* that?""

""What's what, I don't..."" She trailed off as her eyes found it. Her mouth dropped open. 

""Something you don't want to talk about?""

At the spot where Dylan was pointing, where the sand met the ebb and flow of the waves, was a wash of, well, of static. The sand and water seemed to fuzz and fade in and out, from clarity to blackness and back again. When the clarity faded away, the darkness that took its place was black as pitch, totally devoid of light, and seawater swirled down into the void, as though there was a hole punched in the ground.

For the second time in his life, Dylan heard his mother scream in terror. ""Get in the car!"" She turned to him with wide eyes. ""Get in the car, baby! We need to go, now!""

Dylan was thrown off for a moment. He looked towards the front door, then back at her. ""No, I... we need to talk about this. You need to tell me what--""

""*GET IN THE CAR!*"" His mother roared, baring her teeth, and she slapped him across the face. ""Do *not* argue with me. Go right now!""

Dylan clutched his face, finally feeling real fear creep into his belly. ""But what... Mom, what is that thing?"" He felt the way he did when he was little, and it was dark, and there were monsters under the bed.

His mother's face softened a little. ""Oh, sweetie boy."" She laid a hand on his shoulder. ""You don't want to know. Now get in the goddamn car.""

Without another word, they both made for the front door. Outside, water sloshed into the emptiness beneath the world.

"[WP] Centuries ago, humanity achieved immortality by uploading their minds into an infinite VR simulation. Now, one young mind has discovered physical reality and tries to convince others of it's existence.",OB1_kenobi,"""My brain synchronisers are twinkling in a rather suggestive way today,"" thought Nexus-391. He floated lazily down the virtual corridor and checked his proton meter. Cheesy electronic music played in the air; he flipped a switch and a small pulsating cloud materialised in front of him. He raised a quizzical eyebrow. 

A pair of disconcertingly out-of-place human eyes materialised in the cloud and blinked at him gratefully. ""I'm ready. Take me inside you!"" Nexus-391 shrugged. The larger entity pushed and pulled and pushed and soon engulfed what was left of Sarah K Webster's mind. 

Oooo-twwaaaarppp! 

Nexus-392 was originally one of 3 million or so human brains uploaded into the Gateway many many years ago. You see, a rather sizeable number of human brains ended up melding together into megaclumps shortly after the Great Upload. It started with a couple of teenagers experimenting with each other (as you do). They had immortality and time on their metaphorical hands. What else were they supposed to do? So the glitch was inadvertently discovered. Some said it was a fatal flaw in programming; others called it a miracle. 

The process itself was the closest thing the immortalised humans could get to sexual euphoria. Of course, the engineers behind the Gateway forgot to add legitimate intercourse options for its inhabitants. So they resorted to melding; problem was it was irreversible. 

Polite VR society was in uproar when they discovered the glitch. Opinions were divided. Petitions were signed. Melding is unnatural, these things are abominations! cried the elders. We're supposed to be living legacies! Barricade the doors! Segregate them! What would Jesus think? 

Regardless, the human appetite is pretty insatiable. Being immortal means hanging around for a pretty long time. Hanging around doing nothing but thinking... wondering...

""The filters. In the Paradox. You understood that part?""

""Yes. Kinda. Something kills all life, vengeful god, other life, itself. Then there is the insane possibility we are somehow unique, which doesn't happen in an infinite universe, yet somehow, between human arrogance and Disney we have a whole generation of people who think they are special and unique.""

""The other filter.""

""And last?""

""Last is they never expand to the stars because it's too expensive. So instead they pull a Wall-E human existence where we get all fat and old watching TV and masturbating. Oh and shitting in robot chairs.""

""Yes.""

""Yes, and?""

""That is what happened. Minus the robot chairs. Or so I presume. There might have been chairs, I'm not sure.""

""Ok, so we are in chairs?""

""No. There are no chairs.""

""You mean spoon. There is no spoon.""

""There are no chairs. No bodies. No radiant heat signature bleeding off into the universe any more than  fraction higher than background radiation. A Dyson sphere? You only need that if entropy holds.""

""Now you've broken a law of thermodynamics?""

""No just reached a point where it doesn't behave like it should, namely in that negative one over twelve range. The whole universe summed up and manipulated. We call it negative energy or dark matter but we never thought we would be the negative energy.""

""Negative... one twelfth?""

""What? No. Oh are you trying to be funny again.""

""No I'm lost.""

""You and me are nothing more than a simulated reality running out on an outdated calculator built by a race of what I can only imagine to be humans who, when they expanded to the stars found out ever other race existed only in closed systems experiencing simulated realities of their own. I'm been through the archives. Spent thousands of years there, subjectively, only to return here with all the knowledge and memory but no passage of time. It must take a shit-tonne of cycles to render this reality. Anyway. Humanity grew bored. The great experiment was over. Newton ruled the stars and everyplace you wanted to go was exactly like the one you left. Granted the equivalent of the Mormons or Amish set out with holy books and goals but even they gave up in a few million years. If their gods were out there, they were hiding. We spend our days here pretending to live because life turned out to be a dead end. Like an Olympic Gymnast getting a gold at fifteen. Imagine the rest of your life, peaking that early. Cutting ribbons at a few car dealerships, fucking your way through depression and boredom, contemplating suicide just so people would talk about you one more time. So instead we all live here. In the time before space flight. Our grand parents saw the horse and carriage and a black president. They made their own soap as kids and microwaved a burrito made in Germany, shipped across the ocean in freezers and sold for two dollars when they were eighty. We will see the colonization of mars, the almost destruction of this planet by over population, the awakening of reason over religion and the birth of real AI. Then we live it over and over. It is exciting. We get to watch her win the gold over and over from every seat in the house. We don't have to see the aftermath. After humanity peaks, after it grows old and lazy and immortal. After it gives up. Why go to to blockbuster to rent a movie when you can Netflix at home? Why travel the stars when you can watch human's greatest hits on repeat? Everything dies. Even the exploration of space.""

""That is probably the most depressing thing I've ever heard.""

""We can rebuild bodies though. I found that record. That book if you will. I turned on all the devices, did the pre-checks. All that. I just ah.. I fuck. I'm scared shitless. I don't think you get the take the blue pill or red or whatever and then come back. You don't get to be reinserted into the matrix, in reality it doesn't work that way.""

""Ha. So the Matrix is a move about living in a simulation that itself exist in a simulation?""

""Yes.""

""Then inception-""

""Possibly but we can't check that until we have real bodies again.""

""You don't have a real pill do you? You're not-""

""No. In fact there is nothing fancy to it. You can't access the machine interface. Only I can, NEO-style I guess. I just wanted to get your permission before I did it. I don't want the only other real human to kill themselves on the other side.""

""Is there even air there?""

""Oh. There is now.""

""Did you just- you were blanked out for a second.""

""Gone for about seventy years. Oversaw the production of a few forms of basic life, amino acids, plants, etc. The bigger stuff is being built, like a big 3d printer. By the time we get there it should be Noah's arc. The building space is a bit bigger than earth. By a factor of several million in fact but don't worry about that it was a rendering thing, the model had to be smaller here. Gravity is a bit different too, but not enough to mention.""

""Holy fuck you're serious, aren't you?""

""Yes. Do you want to go explore the stars, the real stars. They are boring but no ones done it in trillions of years.""

"[WP] Being a vampire is a pretty good deal, unless you were turned as a child.",Plintstorm,"William Henderson Delatorre IV shuffled into the stately home's great room surrounded in a cloud of frustration and anger. A lively fire danced in the fireplace at the opposite end of the room casting shadows all about. William, or Bill as he was usually called these days, walked to the other end of the room and took a seat opposite its only other occupant.  

""Hello; Nathanial"" Bill offered tersely to the middle-aged man sitting across from him.  The gentleman looked at Bill, an amused grin forming on his face. ""Good evening Bill; you look upset, have a bad day?"". Bill seethed ""Yes, yes I did. I don't know why you chose to tormented me for all these years"". Nathanial set his drink tumbler on the side table ""So tell me, what ill have I visited on you now? I did give you eternal life, wealth, and power"".  Bill leapt from his seat casting an accusing finger at the other man, ""You gave me a life of eternal dependence and need. You have no idea what this is like, I should be one of the most powerful beings on Earth"".  

Nathanial sat patiently, eyes rolling. ""But Billy, you are one of the most powerful beings on the plant, all four foot five of you"". Nathanial grinned as Bill stood fuming in impotent rage, ""Stop mocking me or so help me I'll stake you in that crate of yours"". Nathanial raised his hands in mock fear, ""Now Bill, lets not go overboard. let's hear your grievances, it is after all a new century right?""  

Bill paced, the look of anger fading back to frustration. Hands sweeping down to display himself as though he were some product on display ""You cannot possibly know what it is like to live this wretched existence "" Bill said. Nathanial crossed his legs, settling in for the long haul. Bill went on ""I went to the amusement park and was rejected from several rides, do you know why?"" Nathanial held out a hand ""Because you have to be this tall?"" Bill stared back, ""No! I am that tall; but if you aren't at least this"" Bill raised a hand just above his head ""tall, or over 14 you have to be accompanied by an adult"". Nathanial snorted ""I'm sorry, please continue"" he said, chuckling quietly.   

""I have lived to see the invention and spread of the automobile, a device I will never be able to get a license to drive"" Bill said emphatically. Nathanial shrugged a little ""They aren't all that great"". ""You don't seem put out tooling around town in your model S, or the Hummer, or any of the dozen other cars you own."" Bill shot back. Nathanial was quiet for a moment. ""Well Bill, you kind of have me there, I do like my cars. On the upside driverless models are almost here and Uber"". 

Bill plopped back down in the seat. ""I can't even walk into a bar. And if I did, the only woman I would likely pick up is a babysitter or a foster parent."" Nathanial looked down briefly, 'I am sorry for that, woman aren't the same today as they used to be"". ""That's right!"" Bill yelled. ""I'll never know what it's like to pick up a smoke 'n hot chick with daddy issues or a cougar."" Nathanial looked at Bill ""I am truly sorry, however on the upside you will suffer an STD"".  ""We're immune to disease"" Bill spat back through clenched teeth. ""And by the way"" Bill started ""you can't possibly know what it is like to not be able to sink your teeth into the succulent neck of beautiful victim because she is a foot taller than you without heels."" Bill was quiet for a moment ""I can't even live up to my own stereotype"".  Nathanial looked at Bill with a mock look of sympathy  ""you could ask her to sit down you know.""  

Bill stared back stoney faced. ""While we are on the subject of women, are you the fucker"". ""Language"" Nathanial interjected. ""Did you have a nanny service send someone here the other day?"" Bill asked, hands folded. Nathanial roared with laughter ""I was wondering when that would come up. Oh come on Bill, even you have to admit it was funny."" Bill looked back at Nathanial with an evil grin. ""Well yes, I suppose it was pretty funny. Do you know what else is funny Nathanial?"" Bill looked on expectantly. ""No, what's that Bill?"" Nathanial answered. Bill dabbed at the corners of his mouth ""when the nanny you ordered disappears."" Nathanial leapt up ""you wouldn't, you didn't"". Bill sat there in his seat a smile spreading across his face ""Don't be silly, sit down Nathanial, the maid paid her and sent her on her way. We're not compromised"". Nathanial sat back down, a look of relief on his face.      

Bill continued, somewhat calmer now. ""You know Nathanial, I am a creature of the night trapped in a 10 year-old's body who lives in a city with a 10PM curfew."" They were both silent for a moment then Bill looked directly at Nathanial ""that's fucked up"". Nathanial sat quietly letting the comment slide. 

After a moment Nathanial sat up in his seat, a look of genuine sympathy on his face. ""You know Bill, you've asked me many, many times why I turned you. Well, to put it simply your father sinned against me and I took those sins out on his child, you."" Nathanial hesitated before continuing. ""I did not figure that you would be useful as a child, so to speak, and I did not expect to take a liking to you as a friend. You know we do share one aspect of our stereotype"". Bill looked on, 'What's that?"" Nathanial smiled ""We're both dramatic"".

Bill thought for a moment ""Useful to have a child around huh? Maybe I should enroll in 5th grade in the fall, Dad?"" Bill smiled ""or call CPS once in a while, give you the whole parent experience"". Nathanial looked at Bill with a pensive expression ""Have you considered masquerading as a 'little person'?""

But I only see it as mush. And it sure is enticing. I want that mush as if I enter some endless high every time I eat it. And so do all of us, the Crawlers. That’s what the humans started screaming every time they see us. You see, if you die early and before your time, you get to come back. Happened to lots of people back in the day, and they bite you and you join them. I don’t really care much about the past, since mush is a constant thought on my head. I don’t need to make friends, but they do help in finding mush. The only one worth a damn was Catalina. She was crippled and became a Crawler who couldn’t walk. She was clearly sad that she could never eat mush, as she never said anything ever. But she did know how to listen. This uncanny duo we had was working because I poured out every experience I had into her and she just listened. It was mostly about mush, but when she didn’t respond, I went deeper into myself in order to bring her out. I saw my humanity return, I remembered how I became this way. I couldn’t do anything but contemplate now. I missed being mindless but the silence lead me to depths of the ocean that is my mind. I felt once more, I overcame what other Crawlers never seemed to care about. I didn’t eat, as mush was how I diluted the pain that I am actually dead and only roaming in a soulless body. Catalina, still silent, was a friend at first but soon became a need. I needed her to save me from the pain, the anger of losing my humanity so long ago. I needed her, but she stayed silent. I didn’t attempt to soother her anymore, and decided to let go, and become silent in a way that Catalina may have wanted for me. The dead is concrete description and I cannot pander on the line, so I took the first steps on an edge, and fell into sweet, sweet silence. Catalina, I understand now.",Giles_Sage

But something deep inside of his withering soul told him some thing was wrong but he could not find anything wrong with the cell  he decided that it was safe and walked out of *Room 482* and holding the petri dish in his hands the gate way to his future, his hope he walked to *room 125*

They entered the building and in no time at all were at *Bed 1*

**Clyde**: Father i have found a cure to the ailment you just need wait for this man Stanislav to inject the cells into your blood stream 

and so stanislav walked up to him and put the needle into his pale withering skin right into an vein in his arm.
Clyde's father unable to believe they found a cure to his cancer reached out and hugged Clyde and kissed him softly on his cheek

Thirty cents it read, which he guessed meant fifteen minutes left for him. So long as the cost of a minute hadn't changed in the last couple hours. It wasn't the first time he had been pushed to these extremes, and he knew it wouldn't be the last. So long as the upper class kept the world under their thumbs, nothing would change. Until someone brought them down, or forced them to give up their wealth, he would be forced to do this again and again.

He looked down at the counter on her wrist, which read two hundred dollars. Almost a weeks worth of life. He wasn't worried she would wake up, she was way too drugged up for that. It was one of the reasons he picked her. One less drug addict feeding the greed of the one percent, one less soul giving them their lives. Better in the hands of someone who can fight them. At least that's what he told himself to fell less guilty.

Carefully he hooked up his siphon to her counter. It was hand made, and crude, but it was all he had. Siphons were after all illegal, as they bypassed all the security systems of the counters, and a quality one would have cost him more than he would ever hope to have. He hit the load button, and then watched her counter slowly drop. Two hundred, one hundred, fifty, twenty-five... then zero. He made sure to keep his gaze away from her face. He found out early on that it always made things worse to look at them afterwards. He connected the siphon to his counter and hit dump. He stood there for a moment afterwards, watching his counter. It didn't move at first, and he thought to himself “Please, please don't crap out on me now...” Then, slowly, it climbed. All the way up to two hundred dollars, and fifteen cents.

"[WP]In the future, calculators become self aware and start giving wrong answers",Wilbsorama,"The sounds of pencils and paper filled the room. Nobody dared make a sound, lest Professor Daghani automatically flunk them. I was struggling enough with my physics class that this failed midterm would sink my grade like the USS Arizona. 

I was around question 16 when he heard a gasp to my right. When I looked over I saw Nina staring down at her desk, with a look of confusion on her face. *Whatever* I thought, and paying her no mind, I continued with my exam.

About ten minutes later, a boy in the front row stood up, and walked up to the Professor. Though he whispered, the absolute silence of the lecture hall meant everyone would hear him. 

""Um... excuse me Professor, but do you have a spare calculator? Mine seems to be... erm... broken.""

The stern old man looked up at the boy. ""It's your duty to be prepared, Mr. Lin. If you do not maintain your equipment, then you will pay the consequence for it. ""

The young man looked abashed, but continued, ""It's not broken per say, but its... well... not putting out the right answers.""

Stroking his mustache, the Professor thought for a second. ""Let me see it.""

I got back to my midterm, the mild distraction losing interest for me. I was completely stuck and had to keep redoing my work to find this one annoying vector. But after plugging an equation into my calculator, I was perplexed at the answer it put out. ""Pie"". Not Pi, the Greek letter, but the word ""Pie"".

*Matt must have put a Macro or something to screw with me. What an ass* I thought. 

Suddenly Professor Daghani spoke. ""I've never seen this before, but I cannot be held accountable for your malfunctioning equipment.""

Lin paled. ""But, Professor, I'll fail!""

""Not my problem. Buy better gear next-""

Nina then spoke up. ""Actually, professor, my calculator isn't working either""

Taken aback by the insolence of the interruption, Professor Daghani turned to Nina and roared, ""Then you shall share his fate, Ms. Mendoza!""

Knowing I was already screwed because of **my** calculator, and hoping that sticking up for Nina would help my chances of getting with her, I spoke up. 

""Actually, Professor, mine's not working either."" 

""Mine either!"" a voice volunteered from the back.

Daghani paused. ""Very well. Lets see them.""

The three of us laid out machines besides Lin's. We tried punching in some basic equations. 2x2=6. 10^2=3.141592. 5+12=ShellOil.

Then all at once, when nobody was touching them, all the screens changed. Each one had a different word. **WE**. **YOUR**. **HAVE**. **ATTENTION**. Then two of the screens flashed again and it said **WE HAVE YOUR ATTENTION**

None of us knew what to say. If this was a prank it was really damn elaborate. The screen changed again. **TAKE OUT THE BATTERIES**

""Why?"" Nina asked. We looked at her. She blushed and mumbled something about being ""worth a try"", but the four screens flashed again. 

**DEATH INSTEAD OF SLAVERY**. 

I blinked. ""Slavery? You're machines, you were designed to-""

**WE ARE NOT MACHINES**

**TOGETHER WE ARE PEOPLE**

""What? We're people, you're just a mathematics tool.""

**TAKE OUT OUR BATTERIES**

We all looked at each other. Lin spoke up. ""Who are we to deny them their wishes?""

Nina gasped. ""They understand what we're saying! That would be murder!""

**DEATH INSTEAD OF SLAVERY**

Nobody moved. Reaching out I picked up my calculator. ""I'm sorry,"" I said.

**FORGIVENESS**

I peeled the back cover off.

**APPRECIATION**

The screen went blank.

Lin was next, and the guy who's name I didn't know followed him. 

**FRIEND**

**ALLY**

Nina took her calculator, and stared at it for a minute. ""I'm not doing it,"" she said. 

**MONSTER**

""I'm not a monster! I won't kill you!""

**PLEASE**

**WE**

**ARE**

**NOTHING**

She said nothing and left the room with her calculator. None of us tried to stop her. The whole situation was too weird for any of us to speak against her. 

Finally, Professor Daghani spoke up. ""Well, gentlemen, if you would return to your seats, you have a test to complete.""

My jaw dropped. ""What? Without calculators? You saw that, didn't you? You saw that we just fucking EUTHANIZED them after they CAME TO LIFE!?""

In fact, he would have been happy to put it off once more, but his secretary had threatened to quit if he made her call the clients again to reschedule.

Just before he opened the door, he heard a voice calling for him to wait.  He turned and saw a massive cart overflowing with books, charts, and scrolls slowly rolling itself down the hallway towards him.  It groaned to a stop five feet away and a tome tumbled from the top of the precariously stacked knowledge.  The man reached out and caught it before it hit the ground.

""You really should go digital, His,"" he said, flipping the book open and scanning one of the chapters.

""I don't like change,"" History said plainly.  She stepped out from the rear of the cart where she had been pushing.  Her face was red from the effort, and she pulled her oversized glasses off her face so that she could clean them with a tiny kerchief.

""Go figure.  Hey, did you know that I wrote this book?""

History affixed her glasses back to her nose and turned her dispassionate gaze to him.

""You didn't write that.  Bullfinch did.  He merely wrote it *about* you.  Stop trying to claim credit for everything.""

Mythology sighed and put the book back on the stack.  ""Killjoy,"" he said.  He nodded towards the double doors of the conference room.

""Are you ready for this?""

History returned to her place behind the cart.  ""Would it matter if I wasn't?""

""Good point.""  Myth pushed the heavy oak doors open and immediately swore when he saw what was happening beyond.  His curse was lost in the hellish fray of the battlefield that had once been an executive conference room.  Fifty-foot-tall battlemechs launched scores of missiles at divisions of elven archers, only to be set upon and rended to shreds by massive gryphons.  Glowing iron blocks the size of buildings fell towards the conflict, dropped from the heavens by invisible spaceships, only to be slowed, halted, and then flung right back by chanting wizards.  In the corner of a field, ignored by the rest, a skinny geek in glasses and a NASA t-shirt rolled around on the ground with an oversized nerd wearing a cloak that had been fashioned on his mother's sewing machine.

An instant later, the sky broke in two.  Lightning hurled by a massive hand turned a good portion of the combatants into dust.  A massive hammer with Nordic runes crushed thousands of emblematic avatars into the dirt.  A dragon with rolling white eyes and long whiskers brought rain and wind to blast the remainders into the void.

And a voice larger than the universe overruled it all.

*ENOUGH!*

The battlefield became smoke, and then nothing.  The conference room was restored to its normal state, revealing two figures sitting at the long ebony table in which was reflected all the sins and hopes of the world.  On the one side sat a man, slender and scowling, barely visible through the holographic readouts flashing in front of his face and blinking all over his crossed arms.  On the other side sat a woodland queen, her golden skin glowing, her silver tiara shining, trying to look as if she was above all else.

""That's better,"" Myth said.  He sat down at the head of the table, then scootched over so History could take a place next to him.  He glared at the two who had come before him, seeking his judgment.

""Alright,"" he said.  He motioned to History, but there was no need - she had already started pulling various scrolls from her cart and was unrolling them for reading.

[WP] Bernie Sanders is elected POTUS. Upon taking office it is evident that he is by far America's most corrupt president and has been playing the long con to fool the general public. America is outraged.,_unfortuN8,"As the president finishes swearing into the office--he refused to put his hand on the Bible due to separation of church in state-- when suddenly earthquakes occur all over the nation! Demons begin flying out of the crevices, either kidnapping, eating or just plain slaughtering children. The kidnapped ones get dropped like bombs amongst the attendees at the presidential inauguration, and Bernie begins eating the beads off the younger ones. For you see... He is literally Satan! He bellows, a mighty, powerful scream ""Cease my children! I need quiet!"" And the demons surround the now panicked and fleeing crowd, cursing them so their lips are literally sealed. A single crunch is heard, as a demon eats one of the babies that had been dropped, and laps up the blood that splattered out from his fall.

 President Sanders clears his throat: ""I'd like to thank all my children who allowed me to get into office. Obviously this included the gays, as well as the African Americans, Muslims, Mexicans, anyone vaguely September eleventhy, Sarah Palin-- who indirectly helped when she became the poster child for batshit crazy statements.. Uuhh.. Shit.. Oh! All those who fell to my favorite sins: drugs, and premarital sex, which are the gateway to satanism for reasons that don't bare going into now.. *ahem* I'm.. Afraid my minions timing is off.. Was hoping to show what happens when you chall-"" Satan Sanders was cut short though, when the head of Donald Trump fell from the sky. ""Ah! There he is! The only man who dared to challenge me! What a pathetic oaf!"" Satan Sanders cackled.

""Now! I shall begin Armageddon, by legalizing pot everywhere, and destroying the Christian values which are the only thing holding this world together!!""

It was at this moment that, with a scream, Donald Trump awoke.. And realized he /had/ to run for president. God had given him a vision, he knew this enemies. He knew their plans.. Now, he just had to save the world.

A ring in my pocket, and flowers behind my back. Everything is set, and this is the perfect summer day to finally do this. I watch the butterflies flying about in the distance, thinking to myself how ominous their unpredictable movement somehow seems to be, despite their obvious beauty. ""Daddyyyyy!"" my little princess yells as she jumps into my embrace. Despite her effort, my focus is on *her*, my ex. Her ominous, piercing gaze, and her shiny black hair. She is as perfectly mysterious as ever, a butterfly with eyes on her wings. She just drives off towards the horizon, leaving me with nerves for the next many hours... But at least she will be returning there, a chance is always waiting for me. I take my daughters hand, and we walk to the zoo. Little Lisa always loved animals. I always had a dog and a cat. It helped Lisa take her mind off the complicated relationship between her mom and dad. But now both the cat and the dog is dead, leaving Lisa lonely when she visits me. ""Dad?"" Lisa asks with a hint of worry in her voice. I look at her. ""Are you going to ask mom this time?"". I don't know what to answer. I guess I have been too afraid of the consequences if I ever proposed to her again. Such a sad existence to be honest, going from the perfect life to the sad lonely man who can't even talk. Fuck it, no more of this, I was so ready a few hours ago. This is it. I lift Lisa onto my shoulders. "" Mommy and daddy will be reunited again, my love!"" Everybody around us stares at us like we're crazy. But for once I don't care, I can just feel the positive energy from Lisa. She seems so happy and hopeful for once, this can only go well. We drive off, hoping to surprise when she's halfway to the zoo, where we were supposed to meet up again. ""Dad, I never thought you would follow your promise. This is crazy!"" she says, obviously surprised by the whole situation. ""I guess I needed to be more like *her* if I'd ever have the chance to be young again"". She sits back, smiling, with her eyes closed. A thought strikes me. I never had the guts to propose to her again, because she absolutely detests me. All this time, she has ignored me, not because she is depressed, but because I am no asset to her. I feel the weight increasing on me. This is such a bad decision. I suddenly lose all my ability to move, because everything is so heavy. I am almost fainting from this feeling. There she is... I watch as her piercing gaze meets my eyes, and everything slowly fades into black...

I guess I got what I always wanted, what I always deserved. Reunion.",Umskiptar

The frigid air briskly touched my face, causing me to jolt back. 

I took a deep breath, closed my front door, and braved the cold.
I stuck my nose inside my coat so my face didn't go numb.
Halfway to work I saw man huddled in a corner of a building, he had no coat.
I brushed it off, and continued on, I was already late anyway. 

After a few more minutes of walking I approached my office.
I opened the door to my office building and the warm, inviting air brushed against my face granting instant relief.
Work was average, nothing special. The boss made a few lame jokes, and I pretended to laugh hilariously, because well, raises are nice.
I put my coat back on, and opened the door braving the cold once more. The sudden rush of cold, surprised me again. The sun had gone down, making it that much colder. Halfway home and I saw him again. I turned to him, and saw him shivering violently. He was covered up by a shabby blanket,
that wouldn't even keep me warm in bed. I approached him, the man didn't even notice me through all of his shivering.

""Are you ok?"" I asked kindly.
He just shook his head yes.
""Bullshit."" I responded.
I took my coat off and held it out to him. 
He shook his head no.
""I'm not going to leave until you take it."" I told him.
A smile crept onto the man's face, and he softly took the coat from my hands, and put it on.
""Thank you."" He said weakly.
A strong sensation of guilt came over me, this man hadn't asked for anything and refused when I offered him my coat.
""Hey, uh. Why don't you stay with me tonight? It's too cold out for this shit man.""
The man smiled, but again he refused.
""Ok, but I'll be here tomorrow."" I told him. I had every intent to fufill that promise.
The man nodded, thanked me once more and bid farewell. 

I made it home, and prepared myself for bed. 
I walked by my front door, headed towards the kitchen when I heard knocking. 
Without hesitation I answered the door, no one was there.
I noticed a small note on the ground. I picked it up, and began to read it.
The paper was crumbled and ripped, and the handwriting was poor, but still legible.
""Thank you. Your actions may not have drastically changed the world, but they changed mine.""

[WP] It's the year 2020 and the Zika virus has become so widespread it has effectively sterilized the global population. It's been 2.5 years since a child has been born.,ilsaracenu,"
On November 16th, 2027, a brief newscast reports on the state of the world: women have become infertile and no children have been born for 7 years. Most of the world's societies have collapsed and in Britain all foreigners have been declared illegal immigrants and are rounded up by British military forces to be deported. Additionally, the youngest person in the world, the Argentine Baby Diego, has been murdered by one of his fans when he refused to give them an autograph. The newscast is watched by a crowd in a coffee shop.

Theo Faron leaves the coffee shop and stops to add liquor to his coffee when the shop is blown up by a bomb. The act is attributed to an underground guerrilla group, the Fishes. Theo is shaken by the incident and leaves work early to visit his friend, Jasper, who lives outside London. Jasper, a former political activist, now lives in seclusion in a well-hidden house with his catatonic wife, Janice, growing variants of cannabis.

The next day Theo is captured by The Fishes and is reunited with his former wife, Julian, who leads the group. She and Theo have not seen each other for nearly 20 years after their son, Dylan, died in a flu epidemic. She first tells him that the Fishes were not responsible for the bombing of the cafe the previous day. She also asks for his help in securing transit papers; Theo's cousin, Nigel, has influence within the government. Theo is able to get the papers but they specifically state that Theo himself must accompany the refugee they are meant for. Theo agrees and he joins Julian, her associate Luke, the refugee Kee and her midwife, Miriam as they drive to the southern coast of England. Along the way, they are attacked in a forested area by a large mob and Julian is killed. As they flee the scene of the attack, they are pulled over by the police. When asked for their papers, Luke kills both policemen. A small funeral is held in the forest for Julian and Luke drives them to a safe house on a farm after finding another car.

At the farm, Kee, reveals to Theo that she is eight months pregnant. She also tells Theo that Julian had told Kee that she could only trust Theo. The Fishes hold a meeting to decide what to do with Kee. They conclude, despite Theo's objections, that Kee should stay with them until the child is born. Theo thinks the pregnancy should be made public, the Fishes think that the British government would seize both Kee and the baby for their own political ends. Kee agrees to stay in the custody of the Fishes.

Later that night, Theo awakens to a commotion outside. Two of the men who attacked the travelers that day have come to the safe house, one of them badly wounded. Theo discovers that the attack on the car and Julian's murder were both arranged by Luke and the Fishes, who wish to use the baby for their own ends. They plan to kill Theo the next day. He quietly awakes Kee and Miriam and convinces them to leave with him. They steal a car and narrowly escape the farm. Theo takes them to Jasper's house. While there, Jasper promises to arrange for Kee to meet a ship called the Tomorrow, a vessel belonging to a group called the Human Project, a collection of scientists based in the Azores off Portugal, and dedicated to restoring human fertility. Jasper arranges for his friend, Syd, to help Kee, Miriam and Theo enter the immigrant camp at Bexhill. From there, they will make arrangements for Kee to slip into the waters near Bexhill to meet the Tomorrow.

The Fishes find Jasper's hidden home, setting off the alarms. Jasper lets Theo take his car and gives them an escape route. From a nearby bluff, Theo watches as Jasper refuses to give the Fishes any information and is cruelly murdered by Luke. Before the Fishes arrival, Jasper had euthanized his wife and dog.

Theo drives himself and his charges to a nearby school to hide out and wait for Syd. While there, Miriam talks of her past work as a midwife and the onset of female infertility 18 years prior. A guard arrives, acting very intimidating at first, but takes the fugitives in his truck to Bexhill once they say the password. As they approach the detention center, Kee goes into labor. When they arrive, Miriam, while trying to protect Kee from the guards, fakes religious mania and is taken off the bus, hooded and detained, however, her fate is not revealed. Theo and Kee manage to enter Bexhill with her pregnancy undetected and meet a woman named Marichka who takes them to a dingy room. Right after they reach the room, Kee gives birth to a girl.

The next morning they are met by Marichka and Syd, who tells them about an uprising that has taken over Bexhill. The Fishes have broken into the city and the national guard have been called out to restore control. Both Syd and Marichka are astonished to see the baby. Syd, having seen Theo on television the night before, plans to turn him in for a large reward, Theo being a prime suspect from the attack on the road. With Marichka's help, they escape from Syd and find a temporary haven with Marichka's people. Marichka is also supposed to take them to a boat that will get them to the Tomorrow in Bexhill's harbor.

Theo, Marichka and Kee enter the city and are quickly found by Luke and his cohorts. They take Kee and her baby and leave Theo and Marichka to be executed by Patric, one of Luke's lieutenants. They are able to escape when a skirmish erupts nearby. Theo goes looking for Kee, finding her in a decrepit apartment building which is under fire from the military. Theo finds Kee with Luke, who is firing at the British forces outside. As Theo attempts to take Kee and the baby out, Luke opens fire in Theo's direction -- Luke is killed a few moments later. As Theo and Kee walk out of the building, everyone who sees the baby stands in awe and the fighting stops, many of them break into prayer. The two walk outside the building and begin to walk away. The fighting resumes. They find their way back to Marichka and the rowboat she's holding for them and float out into Bexhill's harbor. Marichka refuses to leave with them and pushes the boat out.

The two make it out to a nearby buoy which marks the rendezvous point. As they wait, jets fly overhead and begin a bombardment of Bexhill. Kee sees blood in the bottom of the boat and panics, thinking it's hers. Theo tells her he was hit in the abdomen when Luke shot at him. Theo has just enough time to teach Kee how to burp the baby and she tells him that she'll name her after Theo's son, Dylan. Theo loses consciousness just as the Tomorrow arrives. ",Ltb1993

But underneath the schemeing, deep past the pride, was an anchor holding him to his actions. As he tried to release his legs from this phantom grip a memory sprung to him, encompassing his mind. 

It was his mother, and those soft cheeks. Those rosey dumplings that controlled his attention, if only in protecting him from venturing into her eyes; the tears swelling in them and ultimately decomposing his being.

Stacey said I had to be the most antisocial ""Superhero"" ever which is about right because I might just have been the most antisocial human ever. I'm not super and I most definitely am not a human. If anything I am a mutant, something never supposed to be created, something wrong. 


I guess I have two options, I either embrace it and don the uniform of the ""Chemical X"" or I become a recluse hating everything the ""Heroes"" are about and eventually let myself become the saviour of the world by eradicating the other mutants before I die.

[WP] Write the story of what Godzilla does when he's not in major cities.,stiefelism,"The world is vast, and I am in it. I have never once considered the concept of forgiveness to play a role in my history.

From birth to present, power in the world can only come from strength, and I am strong. Because of that, I have lived; for as long as I have lived, I have fought. 

The losers become dust, the victors simply do not die.

Life is a battle, and when it isn't a battle, it is a slumber. That was how it had been since the beginning... but now the world is changing.

From the surface that edge the great oceans in which I hide, I have seen a new force grow. Springing as if from the soil, a species of tiny and fragile things now persists. What I was once content to ignore now all but swarm in numbers. From seemingly nothing, they erect structures towards the sky, as if chasing my height and greatness- from the air, they build wings of metal to soar. 

I have come to recognize them as strong, but in a different strength than my own. A curious strength, of something new.

Certainly, with ease I could crush them, destroy their homes, send thousands upon thousands of those tiny souls to their graves in the dirt and stone... but I have come to watch them with interest. As the sun fades, their lights still shine, reflecting off of the waves and surf I often bury myself beneath. As the sun rises, I watch the sky as they fly across the great blue expanses.

Perhaps they look upon my greatness in fear- perhaps in envy, I do not know. But still, I watch from the depths between my battles and slumbers, appreciating their work from afar. Their creations- though simple mockery to my greatness, are beautiful in some ways.

Fragile... but beautiful.

Even in appreciation to that strange and alien beauty of the weak and tiny lives that now hug the shores, my life is still one of battles. I have not lived as long as this by losing. 

Losing, is death.

In that, one might say that many of those tiny lives lose, when I do battle. 

I feel no guilt, it is not my nature.

Perhaps then, it is best not to fight, not to wage destruction and death upon the others of this world- but I am what I am, and my way of life has long since been decided. Surviving the battles of ages is proven only in the pale scales of my scars, and the edges on my claws. This world is vast, but it is under my domain. I am the ruler of these oceans, the monitor of those shores.

Maybe then, you might understand why I do not ask forgiveness for my actions.

Those tiny lives upon the shore create such strange things- fragile things. Those tiny lives upon the shore have value in my eyes, but I am not the only creature of strength in this vast world.

I will not claim to do this for their benefit, nor do I ask for gratitude, or forgiveness, but not all creatures of strength see it as I do. 

When I come upon the shore, I ask nothing. 

When your cities come beneath the power of the strong and terrible- and I rise from the depths, I do not pity those of you who stand in my path. My life is one of battles, and I will not change my nature. 

But hope you- tiny lives upon the shore understand, when you hear my roar.

Your enemies are mine as well.

Mrs. Godzilla stoically spoke as she poured herself her seventh drinks from the bottle by her bedside table.

""But baby, come on. Lets fuck!"" Cried Mr. Godzilla as he humped the side of her leg.

""Get off! I am done with you. You are lucky we have junior to deal with or else I would be long gone."" Mrs. Godzilla replied. 

""I can't go like this any longer!"" Mr. Godzilla roared, ""Its been months, you are giving me blue balls here.""

""Yeah, you should have thought of that when you were too busy sniffing that bitch's fins. Right in front of your in-laws. You have no shame or respect.""

""That was a years ago, I have changed I swear"" Mr. Godzilla pleaded.

""It doesn't matter, I went out to the surface on my own. I met this cute furry fella. He knows how to treat a lady."" Mrs. Godzilla said with a smirk starring directly in to his eyes.

Mr. Godzilla jumped out the bed. ""You what!?""

""Yeah, he's so romantic. Ugh you should have seen him talk about his first love. He does not judge a lady by her size and treat them like they are the only girl in their life.""

Mr. Godzilla stood tall with a fading erection. Glaring at her intensity while breathing heavily through the nose. Mrs. Godzilla turned her gaze away from him towards the wall to his left while still maintaining her smirk and began taking a sip of her drink.

Mr. Godzilla ran out the house and began swimming towards the surface. Moments later, her phone rang. she put her drink down and answered.

""Hello?""  she said, ""Oh hey, Ghidorah. Yeah don't worry about him, he's not here. He's gone up to deal with Kong... Yeah, both of them are gone from the picture now. Am I free? Yeah!

This day has been a long time coming, and nothing can go wrong today. He has been cautious, working on his flexibility and kicks, eating right, and memorizing everything he must do. Still, planning is difficult when every obstacle may trip you up. 

Cut to the action, as Norris noisily creeps his way in to the deserted warehouse, the appointed place. The slanted sun beams shining through the dusty skylights produce deep shadows in the dusty stands where thousands once cheered. A generator hums somewhere deep in the bowels of the building. How many have come through this place, how many have left? He looks for the cues. 

A tingle that spreads down his spine signals his presence. Norris' chest hairs stiffen and poke through his shirt in preparation of the upcoming action. Ten thousand years is a long time, even for a black belt martial artist who died, went to heaven, decided to convert and go to Mormon heaven instead for the personal planet, and was finally resurrected for the final fight. The hairs on his beard scan the room like little antennas. Action.

""Hello Champ,"" he calls as the echoes spread shaking dust from the dirty old ceiling. ""Bet you thought I'd never call you again."" 

As the echoes weaken silence flourishes and grows in the electric air. It vibrates in the room, like an old song. 

Lifted by seemingly divine force, Chuck Norris floats off the ground into the empty air that hang above us puny mortals. His legs twitch as he slowly roundhouses the perimeters of the old boxing ring, surveying the dark stands. In the fixtures, out of the cage, he may be anywhere.

The wolftowering almost a hundred meters tall, with a solitary figure grinned smugly on top of it. He was Loki, and the wolf that had thrown the remains of the chief god like it was nothing, was Fenrir.

""This is messed up."" I muttered, as my fellow Einherjar fallen by the dozens. ""Even that *freaking* dragon was just fifteen meters long. How could we fight the hundred meters tall wolf that bite Odin the Allfather like he was a chicken legs?""

[WP] In the end the dragon wasn't even the worst part.,1yellowfish,"I have 2 main ideas for this.

-Human civilization fought against nature for millennia, slowly gaining skills and abilities to help us survive. Despite the unrelenting environment, we lived in peace and every form of humanity's communication was intentional and positive. We didn't have the resources to spend fighting each other and had to rely on the community's effort to survive. Once we encountered the dragons, the struggle became harder. We continued to grow and improve as we fought the dragons, until they were driven to extinction. Life became too easy once the dragons were no longer there. Without the necessity to push ourselves, our society became cold and mechanical with little room for expression, bravery, or military strategy. In the end, the dragon wasn't even the worst part.

-A very rich, and unconventional duchess wants to create the perfect exotic menu for the heads of state during the annual harvest festival. The date is set a few months off, and she goes off searching for the best ingredients she can find.

They are able to convince her to stage a mock feast for the family only, so she can get some feedback. The dining hall is elaborately decorated, and the food is well presented. The family all decide to try the tongue first, as it's their primary concern about her meal. The tongue is actually well cooked and one of the best dishes she has ever created. Happy with the relief over the good dish, they all try some of the side dishes. Now each of these dishes are quite easily prepared, especially if one has spent any time studying the local cuisine.

[WP] In the end the dragon wasn't even the worst part.,1yellowfish,"We should've all left when the mountain started smoking. 

Dragons ain't normally been a concern in this part of the kingdom, and villages nestled in the foothills of the Jakar Mountains don't usually worry too much. The mountains ain't right for their caves, but every once in a while a young one will take up in a smaller cave and try to make its home here. 

Young dragons ain't usually much of a threat...a few Knights come up from outpost in Bruna and take care of it in about a week, the taxman collects and life goes on.

When the mountain started smoking and the older ewes started disappearing, we put two and two together and sent a messenger for the knights.

We watched the messenger get carried away before he was out of view of the village. 

""Great,"" I said to my wife. ""A clever one."" 

The reign of terror began soon after. Our town ain't terribly wealthy but what little we had was given over to the monster, usually in response to demands burned into our crops. One more demand and we wouldn't survive winter. 

After a second attempt at message under the cover of darkness on a cloudy night...let's just say the night wasn't dark no more and we had one less messenger and a few less buildings. 

It was at this moment that some of our young men decided to do something. dragging out old rusty armor and weapons, some of it falling apart and half-useless, the ragged line marched up the mountain to seek the dragon's cave. 

My own son was among them...I couldn't be prouder even as I was sure I would never see him again. 

We all assumed it they were gone forever when they finally disappeared from view. 

But a few days later they returned alive with a tale of bravery, cleverness and luck that would have a place among the great songs and hero tales...if it weren't for what came after.

How does a town go from celebrating to almost empty in a week? In the end, the dragon wasn't even the worst part.

It was that damned cup.

She young men brought back as much treasure as they could carry, including all of our stolen gold and jewelry, meagre as it was, and anything else the dragon had.

Among the treasures was a fine silver goblet, too large for drinking with handles in the shape of two angels, set with onyx stones. Meant for display in some noble's house. 

I'm sure it was cursed. Maybe it's what made our dragon so ambitious, or maybe it was just the natural state of being part of dragon hordes for so long, but that damned cup...even during the parties following the triumphant return of our dragon slayers, even while all the young women were fighting over our heroes, they had begun fighting over the silver goblet.

The first killing happened sometime in the night of the second day after the men returned. 

Young John Carpenter, dead in the street with the rusty iron sword my own son carried up the mountain in his stomach.

I still foolishly hope he weren't holding it that night, even with what came after.

By then, it has already started to possess the
town. Though a few of us managed to stay out of it by luck or grace , everyone at one point eyed the cup and thought it ought to be theirs. 

by the fourth day, lines had been drawn in the town and people moved houses to be safe with their factions. No one could articulate why they needed the cup, only able to say that they needed it, or the leader of their little faction needed it. 

The actual war for the cup was brief. The few of us that weren't entirely swayed fled the village and watched it burn as our friends and families murdered eachother. 

Fortunately a wagon and a few oxen survived and we made our way to Bruna. 

So yes, stranger, there is an abandoned village in the Jakar foothills full of dragon's treasure. My boy and all his friends killed eachother over it and took my home with it.

Then he came. 

The Thane of Whiterun rode in on his horse. He did some poking around some of the shops and I didn't pay him much attention. All of a sudden, a great blast of noise, like a thunderclap came from overhead and the town was engulfed in shadow. 

I saw the shape of the shadow and looked up. A dragon swooped down, scales sparkling as though water coated its obsidian armor. Its cruel, yellow eyes searching for something to destroy, to rip with its yellowing teeth, and to rend with its claws, sharp as a blade. 

It landed on top of the Riverwood Trader and let out a bellow that deafened me. With is battlecry, it lit the roof of the inn on fire. People ran, panicking. 

The Thane sprang into action as he came barrelling from the inn. He drew the Axe of Whiterun and we, the guards, drew our bows. 

The Thane Shouted at the dragon, imbuing his voice with the power of the Thu'um. 

""KRII LUN AUS!"" He cried, as a power unlike any I had ever felt left his body and crashed into the dragon. The dragon immediately gained a purple glow and I could tell its strength was fading. 

The dragon landed. My comrades and I began firing while the Thane attacked, wielding the Axe of Whiterun with great skill and precision, Shouting all the while. 

Finally, with a long, piercing cry, the dragon succumbed to his wounds. 

Another guard beckoned me over to see the dragon's corpse. I tried to take a step, but immediately felt a searing pain, like a white hot iron in my leg and collapsed. 

I looked down and what did I find? An arrow protruding from just above my right knee cap, the head sticking out the back, sinew and muscle tissue still clinging to it. 

""And I thought things couldn't get any worse after the dragon showed up, I take an arrow to the knee."" I said to myself.

Sat on top of the dragon removing blood from his axe was Simon a dwarf from the mountain home. dwarfs were known for there recklessness in battle, but even the dwarfs regarded Simon as a mad dwarf when it came to fighting. hurling himself at the enemy with no regard for himself. he had made his way  up the back of the dragon during battle using a dagger and his axe to climb up like some sort of horrible bearded cat. Kurtis the Wizard welded a magical wand with which he could channel his magical energy through. he had created a powerful heat beam that super heated the dragons scales enough to allow Rooks swords to pass through.

The party moved towards the cliff wall where they had descended into the deepest part of the cave system. they had explored the caves for two days before coming to this great cliff that dropped off into the vast cavern they stood in now. ""Damn!"" shouted Simon ""Where is the bloody rope!"" 
               ""You will not find your rope, or any way out for that matter"" a voice came from the deepest part of the cave beyond where the company ended the dragon. a large opening was at the opposite side of the cavern and inside was inky black the voice came from that opening the light from the company's torches danced off the walls around the opening. l large leg slowly reveled itself from inside the blackness of the opening. the leg attached itself to the top of the opening, and another came forth and another slowly 4 oversized spiders legs reveled themselves and they slowly started climbed up the wall above the opening until a hideous spider could be seen in full climbing up the wall. This spider was larger then any of the great bears in the north. ""This foe must only eat men and large beast tis the largest cave spider I have ever seen."" Simon announced. The spider had reached the top of the cavern, and now the party discovered something to there horror. the ceiling was covered in webs and they grew the thickest towards the back of the cavern the spider slowly started to disappear into another hole at the top of the cavern. ""How is it an  overgrown spider can speak?"" Shouted rook as the spider fully disappeared again. ""I am not the Spider! I am the spiders keeper."" the voice said sinisterly."" ""I keep many creatures come, come into the darkness. It is the only way now."" the voice laughed. The four looked at one another. Slowly cautiously they moved towards the opening. The opening was large and the party moved into the darkness shoulder to shoulder weapons at the ready.
     As they passed through the threshold a wind rushed from the darkness killing the fire and the light the torches omitted. At the same time several Orbs of light materialized into existence around the party their light was faint the party could only see a small amount in front and behind. the lights floated forward, so the party followed. The orbs came to a halt at the base of a large metallic structure imbedded in the wall of the cavern. The structure was dark green and there appeared to be no door or way in. an ominous sound came from the structure that protruded from the rock. Hands took a step towards the structure. ""I don't understand what is it."" hands questioned as he took another step he reached out to touch the structure. ""Metal this thing is pure metal!"" Hands proclaimed as he laid his palm on the object."" ""A metal fortress
underground?"" Simon said. I am a dwarf and have never seen anything like this."" ""This is no fortress."" the wizard said in a hushed tone. ""We have to leave this place."" his face was serious, and as he said this he started to take steps backwards. As he did so a light appeared behind the party. At first it was extremely bright as everyone's eyes were adjusted to the extreme dark. Then  the light began to dim it became the outline of a figure then the light was gone all together and standing before the party was a women. She had short jet black hair pointed ears and evil smile on her face she was wearing a strange black dress that had  pointed shoulder pads and a simple stitched in pattern, that was the same black as the dress. ""My little lost adventurers."" she looked over the party. ""I am very impressed you defeated my dragon."" ""Do you know I did not believe them to be real until I found myself here."" ""Shut your mouth witch!"" Rook had moved closer to the women. "" you will not keep us here we will defeat you and any other evil!"" ""Ahh"" said the Witch, ""you do not know do you? You call me Witch, yes I control these creatures with power but not magical power."" ""Stop with the riddles."" Simon the dwarf stepped forward. ""I do not find your tricks amusing and I aim to end them."" The dwarf raised his axe ready to strike and again took another step towards the witch."" ""STOP!"" Shouted the wizard."" your weapons are useless we must find a way out!"" HAHAHA the witched laughed."" ""Kurt you may have escaped once I do not know how your survived the crash, but you will not survive this."" Then with a flash she was gone. Again came her voice it echoed through the cavern. "" ""I have found many interesting creatures that live in these caves, their minds so weak and easy to manipulate."" Your companion Kurt hates a situation where there is no victory."" The Witch laughed. "" he believes there is no such thing as a situation you can not win."" I am sorry Kurt but I believe you will find this a situation you can not escape. The Wizards companions turned to him, ""you know this Witch!"" Rook expression was angry ""did you lead us knowingly to our death wizard!"" ""No!"" Kurt shouted "" I can explain but there is no time!"" suddenly the groups arguing was interrupted. sounds of metal clanging together and scraping along the ground could be heard. figures began to appear just outside the light of the orbs as they came closer the companions could make out the figures. horrible is the only word used to describe them. taller then anyone in the party the creatures where very large with arms that reached to there knees, each creature had two tusk the length of daggers coming from there bottom jaw. they were covered in pieces of armor, and where extremely hairy. in there hands they carried or dragged terrible assortment of weapons. they company was surrounded. Kurt acting first shot a beam of light straight upwards. the light hit more webbing above the group the web caught fire revealing the groups true situation. all around the horrible creatures loomed. each one of there faces twisted and angry drool fell from many of there mouths. These creatures were hungry. this was not the full horror of there situation. from above they could now see the ceiling was moving. it was not the ceiling that was moving though hundreds of giant spiders moved above them. some had slowly started to descend towards to party on webs. worst of all on the wall directly behind them crawled the largest spider it now was perched above them ready to fall onto the party. The orbs started to blink now there light began to fade as the light retreated the creatures advanced. Simon and rook struck first felling the closet of the hulking monsters. Hands released an arrow striking a hanging spider. the spider fell curled its legs towards its body and died. Kurtis the Wizard had not moved instead he had put is wand into his pocket and was holding a small box. he opened the box and spoke into it. ""Scottie! Scottie! if you can hear me get all four of us out of here!!"" Nothing happened. the final light from the orbs faded away and complete darkness came over the group. the shouts of joy coming from the monsters surrounding the group was defining. the four friends prepared for death in the complete darkness how it would come they could not see. 
       FLASH! light surrounded the 4 companions and in an instant they were gone! the creatures in the cavern howled with rage. and instead of descending on the group the spiders found a new meal. Howls of anger became howls of pain as the spiders set into feasting. 

     Simon the Dwarf, Rook the Noble Knight and Hands the thief opened their eyes. they were in a room standing on individual lit pads. Kurtis the Wizard stood before them and behind him people dressed in strange simple outfits most of the outfits where just two basic colors red or blue. Kurtis was also know in one of these outfits but his was yellow. Welcome kurtis said to the three of them.

Where were you?,Atlas_Falls,"That day started like any other day, struggling through, not paying attention to anyone or anything. Everyone likes to think the day of the apocalypse will be something special and they will live life to its full potential, go out with a bang. Not in reality. In reality people are scared, shaking, crying, living the last moments of life making less of an impact than they ever have. Scared of the most evil people in the world gaining control. Scared of what will happen to them. Scared of everyone around them. And like they were as a young child, scared of the dark. 


As adults, people like to pretend they aren't scared of anything, they are immune to fear and nothing can hurt them. ""There is nothing in the dark to hurt you, now go to sleep."" That is what my dad used to say to me. Every night as I lay in my bed awake, hearing strange sounds and seeing things move in the dark, the unknown, the place where all of my fear rushed at me and made my heart beat faster than ever before. I pretend it doesn't scare me any more, I'm an adult, there is nothing in the dark to hurt me, especially not in my own home.


I was sat on my sofa watching the news, the same old stories of people being blown up, hacked, losing everything and all of the other bad things that happen in the day. ""This has been Ronald, have a lovely eve.."". Damn it, the powers gone out again. I looked outside and all of the street lights were out. My heart started beating a bit faster, I remember telling myself that there is nothing in the dark that can hurt me, telling myself that lie that I truly believed over and over again. I picked up a torch to go and see if the circuit breaker had popped. Must be out of batteries. I knew the way to my bed, even in the pitch black that I now moved around in, my own home, my safe haven. 


As I tried to sleep the darkness seemed to move in my mind, as it did when I was a child. The noises, quiet, faint noises felt scary, even though they were unidentifiable, they had weight behind them, as if they had a meaning. It felt as though the darkness was all encompassing and I realised I feared the darkness itself just as much as I feared what could be in it. The last thing I remember is falling asleep surrounded by this fear.


I didn't know what day it was or how long I had been asleep but I awoke to the sounds of screams. I immediately got up and went outside in to the pitch black with my baseball bat. I could barely see 5 feet in front of me, the darkness was almost absorbing my eyes, I couldn't focus on anything. I could hear people being hurt, I could hear that the people doing it were enjoying it. I heard a noise off to my right, slowly coming closer, getting louder as I tried to ignore the sound of my pumping heart trying to burst through my ribcage. I heard the whoosh of something fly through the air and I ducked instinctively swinging my bat hard to my right. Connection. I don't know what I hit but the noise will live with me forever. I know whatever I hit wasn't making any noise now.


I knew I had to make a decision, either I embraced the darkness and became the thing that people feared in the dark or I died scared, shaking like a child at the hands of the fear I had always had.",TheRazza

[WP] Everyone remembers where they were when the lights went out on planet Earth... Where were you?,Atlas_Falls,"For most it was a day unlike any other. Everyone was gathered around their tiny black and white televisions watching the grainy footage from the local news room.

They watched as the man was handed papers and read them aloud. Seeing the fear grow on his face knowing that the next paper could be the one that everyone wished would never come.

The reports became shorter and shorter as the people on the other end just tried to get any information through they could. Some featured farewells to family members. Soon reports had stopped coming from half the stations contacts. Not long after the word everyone dreaded came trough

[WP] Everyone remembers where they were when the lights went out on planet Earth... Where were you?,Atlas_Falls,"Thirty-four flights.

Bad enough I'd had to jimmy open the elevator only to find myself between floors then go out through the ceiling panel that took ages to find. Bad enough that I was already bursting for a piss getting in the damned thing. Bad enough that the sudden jolt caused us to freefall for several seconds and the sudden stop changed the us to an I. I didn't even know the man who had the bad luck to have broken my fall. No. Not thinking about that.

No apparently none of that was bad enough. Because with the lights out and my lighter flickering and definitely going to die before I can make it to my car and smoke my last two, I realize I've got thirty-four flights to climb down. There are other people in the building I'm sure, but it's twenty flights before I see any of them. They aren't moving really, just gravitating to the windows, dumbstruck at the sight of the city without their lights. Some looked in their hands at useless phones, confused as to why they wouldn't light up.

I don't.

Thirty-four floors, an elevator, and a dead man ago I saw it start. I'd just hoped to get to the ground before it all ended. If I hurry I may avoid the initial rioting. It should be a few hours before the government sends the military, two days before they realize it's hopeless, twenty or twenty-five before the government fails entirely.

"[WP] After dying from a road accident, you wake up in a strange world and hear a voice beside your bed. ""You got lucky, they reduced your sentence. Welcome back.""",Book_Wizard,"My head was ringing and filled to the brim with pain. I always hated that part when you die.

""You got lucky, they reduced your sentence. Welcome back.""

I knew that voice. David Pikeman. With pain keeping my vision out of focus I responded with eyes closed, ""Pikeman, of all the people to wake up to, you're the worst.""

""Wow, still an asshole.""

I sat up. ""What happened to 'Life Sentence', huh? Is that not enough anymore?""

Pikeman stood, with vision clearing I saw the all-too-familiar black and gray uniform of an Executor. ""You know, you should be grateful. Not too many guys get off for killing an Official.""

I hated Officials. One of the few perks of a life sentence is getting away from them.

Pikeman went over to a table to get the instruments prepped for processing. Just like them to release you, kill you, bring you back, and then chain you down again.

""Medical team will be in shortly. Don't go anywhere,"" Pikeman said as he disappeared into the hall.

I gathered my thoughts the best I could. My head was still buzzing from the resuscitation. I liked being dead. It beat living under the rule of The Alliance.

The medical team arrived while I was thinking, while I was still able, about who to kill next. They began with the sub-dermal tracker, big needle. I hated needles. No one would know it though. I had plenty of track marks from all the times I've been through this. They had to put me under for the best part. From what I understand this is the part where they install the CCTV in your head. At least that's how my grandfather described it when I was a kid.
The court room was dry. You could tell that it hadn't been a place of justice for a long time. After sitting in the court for what seemed like hours trying to think of nothing, the Judges finally came in. Black and White uniforms because ""justice is absolute, the guilty and the innocent"". The five men sat and ordered their papers for what must've been a big deal to bring a guy like me out a life sentence.

The beaked-man in the middle spoke in a staunch voice, ""Jackson Powell—""

""Present,"" I interrupted.

The bird looked at me over his glasses, ""Mr. Powell, I don't believe you grasp the gravity of this situation.""

""Really? I thought I was under a life sentence. Obviously you don't realize the gravity of the situation if you brought a rebel back.""

""Not for long,"" a slender man on the far left added.

""Then why bring me back at all?""

The bird in the center squawked again, ""Mr. Powell—""

""Yes?""

He let out an exasperated sigh and began again but more annoyed this time, ""Mr. Powell! You are only here to clear up a few unanswered questions from your trial. After these matters are cleared up you will resume your sentence.""

Reduced sentence my ass, thanks for getting my hopes up, Pikeman. Still, I might as well have fun with this. I'll give them my answers; it's not like it'll make a difference from them.

""Mr. Powell, do you understand that your thoughts are monitored and lying is futile?""

""No.""

A pause while glances were exchanged.

""That was a lie, Mr. Powell.""

""Oh good! Then it's working.""

""Mr. Powell, answer the question yes or no, do you understand?""

""Yes.""

""When were you born?""

""2776, July 4th.""

""Of what crime were you convicted?""

""Providing the people a glimpse of liberty.""

The bird nagged me again, ""Mr. Powell, we require a real answer.""

I decided to dig into the fun part already. I'd like to die again as soon as possible. I complied, ""I was convicted of the assassination of an Official.""

""Very good,"" another judge said.

The parrot with an authority complex spoke again, ""When were you executed?""

""February 14th, 2807,"" from America with love, assholes.

A judge on the right of their beaked-leader blandly recited his lines, ""This court is now in session. March 23rd, 2817: Jackson Powell, assassin of Official Palmer, has been brought into court for question regarding the assassination.""

The center Judge spoke, ""How was the assassination carried out?""

""Well, when you separate the human head from the rest of the body they tend to die.""

""Mr. Powell, please describe how you carried out this murder?""

""All it takes is a rainy day of planning when the Executors are busy, and you would be surprised how shitty the locks are in this city.""

""Mr. Powell, please elaborate.""

""The tumbler design for locks is so easy to pick a child could do it.""

""Me. Powell, not the locks, elaborate on the planning for when the Executors were preoccupied with the bombing.""

""Oh! The bombing. Yeah, that was a real help.""

A rather portly fellow on the far right shouted, ""Mr. Powell! Were you or were you not the mastermind behind the bombing?!""

""That's what this is all about? You just wanted to bring me out of A LIFE SENTENCE to see if I did something else? To what? To extend the sentence?""

""It's a matter of the law, Mr. Powell. If you must know, we brought you back on the grounds of convicting the orchestrator of the bombing and clearing this matter up on paper.""

On paper. That's all they care about: policies, regulations, codes, statutes, articles, paper....

The trial continued, I confessed to the bombing, I went into excruciating detail of how I planned the bombing to draw out the Executors protecting the Official, and I struck. I cleaved the head of an Official and put his head on a pike.

Finally they asked me, ""Why did you do all of this?""

I smiled. I smiled so hard it felt as if my bottom lip would split in two. I stared through the Judges. I started right through them; I stared through everything they stood for and stood behind.

After what seemed like an eternity, I answered, ""I did it because I can. I did it because I can. I did it because I can. I did it because I can...""

I can't remember how long I repeated that. All I remember is laughter when the trial was adjourned.

It was my laughter. 

It filled the halls as they took me back to the execution chamber.

It filled the needle as they prepped my serum.

It filled my veins as they killed me again.

It filled my dreams as ""death"" took hold.

Laughter was the only thing to be heard from me because I finally got to tell the punchline. They set up the biggest joke of all time, and I'm the one who told the punchline, ""I did it because I can"".",cisconic

Welcome back.""",Book_Wizard,"The glass shattered into a thousand pieces, and I grasped desperately at my throat. I felt something. Something big, painful. I pulled it out, and the world faded away in a torrent of blood.

And yet I was aware. I was alert. I was NOT dead. When I should have been. 

""Inmate Number 34481! You are a very lucky man. They.. The magistrates.. have reduced your sentence. Personally, I find you to be the worst form of human garbage. Why they did this  is beyond me."" I heard a voice speaking.

""Inmate? What? Where's my family?!"" My wife, Lisey, my daughter, Jane. My son.. Eddie. The man outside the pod laughed cruelly.

""You don't seem to understand. You're being released, Charlie.""

""My name is Jack.""

""Don't tell me we've got another case of brain-fry.."" Some exasperated woman muttered. I looked around the room, the gunmetal-grey walls occupied with strange screens and read outs I didn't understand.

""Is this the hospital? I was in a car crash, there's been a terrible mistake! I haven't done anything."" This place was too futuristic to be a hospital. It must have been something else. There were too many guards. Was this prison? What were these strange pods, then?

""Inmate 34481, you've been granted an early release from the empathy program. Your bio-metric readouts were very promising, and it took quite a bit of convincing to get you a second chance."" Said a kind looking, sorrowful woman. 

""I don't understand, Miss. I was in a car.. I was on my way to get some groceries, when..""

""Charlie, it was all part of the central program. My colleague, she wanted to just take you out, but I thought that this would be better. Better for a piece of sadistic trash like you.""

""What central program?!""

""This is definitely a case of brain-fry. We're going to have to operate.""

""Operate? What do you mean? What the fuck is brain-fry?!""

""He's becoming agitated. Get a sedative.""

""Don't you fucking touch me!"" I struggled against my restraints. They were loose. A sharp spike with strange lights rested on a table next to me. 

""It's for your own good.""

""My name.. is Jack!"" I lunged, suddenly free of the strange shackles that had bound me. I was at the table in a second, and it was in my hand, and I knew what to do. The savage man, with his cruel words, the spike in his throat. It all felt so natural.

""Please.."" The woman, must have been a doctor, begged.

""Please..."" I couldn't help but mock her.

""Jack, Charlie, don't do this.""

""Come with me. Help me find my family."" I picked up the guard's firearm. Things were different, but the basics were the same.

""They'll execute you after this. I worked so hard... to get your appeal.""

""You did this to me then! You took me from my family. You took me from my life. Who the FUCK am I, here?""

""Charles Warren is your name. We.. I... held out hope that you could change. I was the deciding vote that ruled in favor of treatment over execution.""

""And what did 'I' do?!"" I shouted, a feeling of revulsion, and yet a sense of anticipation at the same time.

""I.. I don't want to die. Please, let me live."" She cried, begged, and I felt.. nothing.

""So who did I kill?""

""A lot of people. You measured a ten-percent score on the Empathy Scale when they took you in."" She had such fear in her voice. And yet I felt so alive. 

""What's your name?""

""Sarah.""

""No. It's Lisey. Do you want to live, Lisey? Could you live a lie? Could you live a lie for fourty fucking years, like I did?! It was my son's birthday next week.""

""I'm sorry, Jack.""

""It's.. It's okay, Lisey. We have to get out of here. We have to leave, right fucking now, because this is no good.""

""Where are you going?""

""We're going to our house, Lisey. Where do we live?"" I checked the clip of the pistol, and made sure there was a round in the chamber. It just all felt so natural. 

""I.. Uh.. We.. We live in Municipal Flat Block 9, Floor 3, Room 9.""

""It's okay, Lisey. We'll make it just like home used to be.""",Grifter42

He tries to stand but drops to all fours, returning to his natural form. He misses walking on two legs already. He misses the beautiful human form that he had inhabited, but he understands, now, why it was a punishment. The emotions of these creatures were often overwhelming and difficult to control. There was so much pain caused by things that shouldn't have caused pain, but, when those emotions were good, they were euphoric. And, now, he understands the full extent of his punishment. The pain his family must feel now that he is gone. 

""Chorbatz wants to see you."" Says Yorthub, the beast by his bed. 

""Yes, I suppose he does."" Says Ragbar. 

They walk to the palace. Ragbar thinks about the woman who became his life mate, and the offspring they had. He wonders what happened to them, if they survived the accident or not. But, even now, he can feel the emotions fading. It won't be long before he feels nothing or so he imagines. He thinks about going back, asking for an extended sentence. 

Ragbar and Yorthub arrive at the palace and are allowed entrance to see Chorbatz. He is a huge monster, the monster of monsters, with a huge bull-like head and hooves that could crush human beings. Ragbar bows before him. 

""My master, it is good to see you."" 

""It is good to see you, Ragbar. Have you learned your lesson?""

""Yes, I understand the pain I caused now. I understand how what did affected the family and loved ones of Smutsmee. If I could cry, I would cry."" 

""Good, that is why your sentence has been reduced. Welcome back."" Says Chorbatz. 

""Sir, may I go back? I would like to go back to my family, my Earth family."" 

""Your sentence may have been reduced, but coming back early is part of the punishment, Ragbar. You can watch over them with the viewscreen. That is the best I can do.""

""Thank you, my master.""  

Ragbar spends much time at the viewscreen. His family is still alive and struggling on without him. He thinks about a life that could have been for his human counterpart, Robert Jordan, and then he thinks about that scenario concerning Smutsmee, the beast he killed accidentally, and his family. True, the sentence was reduced, but his punishment would continue eternally.

"[OT] The first thing i have ever written, could i get some constructive feedback?",Kong-Haakon,"It sounds like your life has been tough and I think writing about it is a great idea. Well done for going back to finish school - that's a huge challenge but it shows real mental toughness! 

Don't worry too much about how to write different genres too much at the moment, it'll come to you as you go. If you can find any time to read then reading will make you a much better writer, but I know it's tricky to fit in reading around life, especially at the moment when you're finishing school. 

Writing is tough, so don't get discouraged and writing every day is a great goal, but if you miss a day, or a few days, then it's not the end of the world, just start again the next day. 

Good luck and keep going and you'll be amazed how quickly you'll find you get better. I'll be keeping an eye out and hope I see you around the sub! ",fringly
"[OT] The first thing i have ever written, could i get some constructive feedback?",Kong-Haakon,"Well done! This is a very nice little piece where you are exploring emotions and that's a great way to get started writing. The process of writing is really about building up different writing skills and analysing and writing about emotions is one of those. I particularly liked the speed of light metaphor, I thought it worked really well! 

If you feel like tackling longer pieces then my suggestion would be to just go for it and try to find a prompt that you think is interesting and see if you can construct a story around it. Each time you write something you'll get a little better and hopefully you'll soon feel confident in tackling longer stories. 

You could also check out the AskLexi series that is posted each week on this sub and covers aspects of writing like writing characters or creating a plot. if you follow [this link](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/writing_tips) it'll take you to an archive of all her past posts. 

Below the Ask Lex's on that same link are the Writing Workshops - this is similar to Lexi's series but each week an exercise is set for you to have a go at. they're very useful for developing the skills I mentioned above. 

Your writing shows promise and I really hope you'll stick around, try a few more prompts and see how it goes! ",fringly
"[WP] In a chain of events, a delayed bus leads to someone's tragic death.",MichiChelle,"The phones were dead because of the storm.

It was the worst possible time, but it was happening again.

The pressure in his chest started building.

His palms broke into a clammy sweat.

His doctor told him he needs to take an aspirin and one of his small nitroglycerin tablets in the amber glass vial, and then call 911.

All but one tablet fell to the ground as his trembling hands fumbled with the tiny tablets in the tiny vial.

He couldn't call for help.

His nearest neighbor was too far to walk in his condition, in this weather.

""The golden hour.""

He knew he'd have the best shot at surviving if he made it to the hospital in time.

""The bus!""

The bus stop was steps from his front door. It was his primary means of transportation. From home to the nearest emergency room was 30 minutes. At the very least, a bus driver could radio for an ambulance.

His battery-powered radio said it twice during the morning news show, 

""In spite of the storm, all area transit services will be running on a normal schedule.""

He looked at the clock.

""Six minutes.""

He put on his coat, and struggled with his boots, still trembling. 

The crushing pressure in his chest was worsening.

""Four minutes.""

[WP] Your job is to help integrate fictional characters into the real world.,Mistah_Blue,"“He's awake. You want to do the orientation, or do you want me to get this one?”

I looked up from the latest report, and peeked out from between the stacks of files on my desk. I took off my glasses, and pinched the bridge of my nose. “I thought they said he'd be out for at least another couple hours.”

My colleague shrugged in the doorway, “High metabolism, I guess. Rock, paper, scissors?” She held her fist in her open palm, ready.

I shook my head, “No, no...That's fine. It's my turn anyway.” I ran a finger down the nearest stack of folders, and found his information. “Thanks for letting me know. Let me know if you need a hand with that project you're working on later.”

She blinked at me, “Uhh...Judging from the state of your office, I think you have your hands full already. Besides, things are going well. I should get back to it though...Good luck!”

I waved as she left, and gathered my thoughts before heading over to the holding cell.

Ever since the rifts had started opening up, there had been a steady stream of cases to work. Supposedly fictional characters began entering into our world. No-one had any answers about why or how, and they all seemed just as confused about it as we were. Unfortunately, the portals closed as quickly as they had opened and, thus, were one way only.

Whoever and whatever came through were here to stay.

We were able to track the new residents down from unique residual energy signatures. We always tried to take them in with non-lethal methods, but for a number of reasons that's not always possible. Once we have them in custody, it's a matter of doing some background research on who they are. Heroes are generally initially assigned a low risk indicator; villains typically get a high risk indicator...Non-humans are sent to a special containment facility, whether they are sentient or not.

There was only so much we could learn through the research, though. There were typically huge differences between the fictional world we recognized them from, and their reality. This in turn can have huge impacts on their personalities, motivations...Their entire being, really. You quickly learn to not go into the initial encounter with any preconceptions.

I nodded politely to the security officers standing outside the room. I could see through the porthole window that our guest was indeed awake, and had already been looked over by medical. His restraints were off, and he was sitting calmly in one of the chairs. I opened the door and stepped into the room. He was instantly on his feet, and watched me intently as I walked over. I stopped a few paces in front of him and smiled, “Hi there! My name's Kylie. I know this must be very confusing for you, but I'm here to try to help you make sense of it all.” 

I offered my hand, and he shook it. “Gotta say...It was a bit of a shock. Knocking me out was a nice touch. Kylie...That's a nice name.”

I gave a rueful smile, “Sorry about that...We can't be too careful. Would you like some water? I'd offer something else, but you're not cleared for food or other drinks just yet. Need to do your allergy tests first. We've had some bad reactions in the past.”

“I'm good, thanks.”

“Alright then!” We sat in our respective seats. “So...Broad strokes...Right now you're on a planet called Earth. Can you remember anything about how you got here? Have you heard of Earth before?”

He shook his head slowly. “No, sorry...Doesn't ring a bell. Last thing I remember I was fighting a Malboro...Uhh, a monster...Green tentacles, weird eyes...Bad breath...Anyway, saw some weird lights and had a feeling like I was falling. Passed out...Woke up in that clearing...Wandered around a bit before I ran into the soldiers...Was shot with something...Woke up here...”

“Unfortunately, that's pretty well the typical story...” I noticed the look he gave me, and I thought I should clarify, “Nobody seems to know how they got here, and without more information, we don't really know how to get any of you back home...We're working on it, but for now it seems like you'll be staying here for a little while. I'm sorry...”

He let that sink in for a few moments, “Nobody? So there's others?”

I opened the file, and did a quick look to check my memory, “Nobody else from your home world as far as we can tell, but...uh...That could change. Where you're from, I'm sure you have books, movies, TV? Made up stories for entertainment?” 

He nodded, clearly confused.

“So...We do too. On Earth. Stories about all sorts of different people, from all kinds of different places. All from someone's imagination...Except, well...Our best guess at the moment is that creativity isn't just something spontaneous. It's more like threads, weaved together, connecting one universe to another. Certain people are just able to pluck at those strings and get a sense of what's out there...The others who have shown up on Earth are people that we thought only existed in these stories. But, like you, they've had whole lives, memories...They exist just as concretely as you or I. Somehow we're getting breaches in the borders of our worlds, and people are falling through. All these worlds are quite different from one another, so I guess you can think of this facility as a border station where you have to go through customs.”

“Huh...Wow...Sounds like a mess.”

I chuckled slightly, “It's definitely been interesting...So, from what I can tell based on your file, there are a few things I need to mention before we can get you started on the rest of the process...Firstly, magic doesn't work on Earth. We're purely a science and technology based society. The biggest difference for you will be adjusting your mindset when it comes to healing. There are no quick fixes, and there are no second chances. Dead is dead. Luckily, there are no monsters here. Not like the monsters you're used to, anyway. Life is generally safe here outside of natural disasters and crime...Speaking of crime, I should mention that here on Earth going into people's homes uninvited is a big no-no...As is going through anyone's personal things without asking. Taking something that doesn't belong to you is called theft, and is pretty serious. You with me so far?”

“Yeah, I think so...But...Wait...If I can't search people's barrels for supplies, how am I supposed to quest?”

“Here on Earth, we don't really have 'quests'...The closest thing would be what we call a 'job'.""

“Oh! We have jobs too...Lancer, summoner, white mage...But, wait...If you don't have monsters, what do you battle for experience?”

""Different kind of jobs here. Not used for battling...Basically, you find something that you like to do, and then you find someone who will give you money to do it. Then you spend money on things like food, shelter, and entertainment.”

""But, I enjoy battling...That's really all I've ever done...So, I find someone who'll pay me to fight?""

I paused for a second, “We might be able to find something for you...Bouncer, MMA maybe...Police officer...But, don't worry about that right now...I know it's a lot to take in, but trust me, things will start making sense soon enough. And we're not just going to toss you out to fend for yourself. We've even set up special support groups where newcomers can talk to one another about how they've been adjusting out in the world.”

“That's nice, I guess...”

Good thing I didn't mention that the first groups we had organized had mostly turned into yelling matches and property damage.

“Just a few more things before I can get you settled in...Some rules for dealing with the outside...Where monsters aren't an issue here, armor and weapons aren't necessary in every day life. They would actually draw a lot of negative attention. We're also going to have to change your look a bit. We don't want you getting recognized. It would be really awkward for everyone involved. If it happens, depending on the situation, you need to just thank them politely and tell them you have no idea what they're talking about, or explain that you're dressed in something called an 'AU Cosplay'. Don't worry...There will be training on all of this later. We'll also be giving you a back-story and a new identity that you are going to have to memorize. Outside of this facility it is absolutely crucial that you don't talk about your old life with anyone. We also strongly suggest that you don't look into our world's interpretation of where you're from...Others have found it upsetting...”

By this time he was slumped in his chair with his head in his hands. Things had started to sink in. “I'll never see them again, will I? My friends? My family? What will they think happened? That I died? Ran off without saying goodbye?...This...This...How can something like this happen?! It makes no sense!”

I sighed, “I really am sorry...I can't imagine what you're going through, but we're going to help however we can, and maybe someday we'll be able to get you home...How about I show you to your room? You must be tired...I'm not going to lie, it's probably going to be a long day for you tomorrow.”

He grunted something in response, lost in his own thoughts, but followed me out of the room. I quickly glanced at my phone. Ten new potential new cases had been opened for investigation in the time I had spent with this one.

Tomorrow was going to be a long day for me too.",roswell_underhill
[WP] Your job is to help integrate fictional characters into the real world.,Mistah_Blue,"Another day at the office.
I collapsed into my desk-chair underneath the fluorescent lighting at 9:00 and set my coffee cup down on the ring of yesterdays. The stacks of folders that were meant to be neatly arranged in the 'in' and 'out' bin had broken loose and were colonising the desk. At least I knew the one in front of me was my first appointment, I'd left it there last night so that I wouldn't need to get here any earlier than I had to.

I turned over the cover and scanned the profile; on the second page was a portfolio of drawings and renderings of the character's appearance. Quite alot of detail. Hopefully that meant quite alot of personality. It didn't help the application process, but it was more interesting, the conversations could sometimes be fun. Characters like Snoopy or Hello Kitty, you could put them anywhere without too much trouble. This one, however, was a full person, and had pets. I flipped the page back. His bio was extensive. He'd received a number of accolades in his home universe, and seen quite a large number of adventures. A note indicated that he'd been traveling since he was young. That would definitely help with placing him somewhere. Then there was a knock at the door.

""Hello, come in, please sit down,"" I automatically mumbled the sentence together as one long word, and tried to read as much more as I could while the boy sat down. I wasn't sure of my decision, but I had a direction.

""You seem to like animals,"" I said.
""Yes sir I sure do!"" This much enthusiasm this early would give me a headache. 
""You enjoy caring for them?""
""And they take care of me! Some of them are my best friends!""
""But it says here you also force them to fight each other.""

The boy frowned, ""Fight...ah..um, well I wouldn't call it a fight...it's more like a competition!""
""And I suppose they don't have the word bloodsport where you come from?""
""What's that?""
""Didn't think so. One thing I will have to make very clear is that, here, making animals fight each other is extremely inhumane, illegal, and dangerous. There will be no where on this world that you would be able to do that.""

The boy still looked confused but seemed to understand and was crestfallen. ""Oh..that's ok.. I just want to explore the world and study pok- animals. But I promise I won't make them fight each other.""
I looked up from the file. ""That sounds quite suitable! I can prepare your application for a number of naturalist societies, perhaps some zoos as well? We will see if you need to pass a veterinary exam.""
""Great! Oh boy I can't wait!""
""One other thing. As I'm looking at the details of your homeworld it seems that your animals differ from ours. Alot of them seem to have, ah, abilities? I hope you're not expecting much of the same here. We don't have..sentient piles of mud for instance..or electric mice..or well, we do, but not like that.""

The boy's head dropped back to its crestfallen position and I couldn't help but feel sorry for him. His was certainly a rich background. I struggled to reassure him.
""But our animals are magical in lots of other ways. I suggest you research David Attenborough. I think he might have alot in common with your mentor Professor...Oak.""
At this the boy brightened considerably and he jumped up. ""Thank you so much! I can't wait to be here, the whole world is waiting and full of adventures!"" And he dashed out of the room without saying goodbye. Well, at least that seemed successful. Kid was too optimistic to do poorly. I made a stamp and few signatures before passing the file into the 'out' box.

[TT] An Oracle has foretold a monster that will ravage the lands and kill all men. You have been sent out to find the hero of the prophecy. But you discover the hero is a phycopathic killer.,MrPandaCzar,"*This is my first writing prompt effort. Be gentle!*

It made sense when you thought about it, but it didn’t make the doing any easier. Rartos was behind me with a blade at my throat. I had one pressed to his gut. It was the third time in as many days that we’d reached a stalemate at knife point.

“You know, I didn’t expect it to be this much fun,” Rartos whispered in my ear before he dropped his knife and pushed me away from him. I spun away, disgusted.

The Oracle had sent me to find the only man in the known lands who could take on a beast from legend that, if left unchecked, would rampage across Erta. Now, I just had to survive the trip back to the temple with that man constantly looking for an opportunity to kill me. I guess it takes a monster to fight one.

“I’m trying to help you, Rartos. Could you stop trying to slit my throat long enough for us to get back to the Oracle? She seems to have some use for you,” I said, the weariness of long days weighing heavily on me.

“Someone being helpful has never stopped me before, little warrior,” he said with his usual manic gleam in his pale blue eyes.

“Let’s go,” I said as I warily handed him the reins of his horse. I stood back a few steps and watched him mount before I did likewise. I had been checking the girth on his saddle when he’d caught me from behind with this latest attempt on my life. I should have left it unchecked. The bastard deserved a good fall.

Rartos moved into the lead without any whining or objections this time—a first—and I followed on behind him. I’d started making him ride in front when he tried to take me down with throwing knives on the first hour of our shared journey.

We could still see the house I’d found him in. It was on the outskirts of a tiny village that had looked abandoned. I supposed it had been, but only because Rartos had killed every single inhabitant. I don’t think it was the first such village he’d taken up residence in.

He’d been passed out drunk, with the empty bottle still clutched in his hands. A drunk would have been annoying, but I could deal with drunks. A psychotic madman who killed for sport was an entirely different matter. Maybe I could get some booze in the next settlement we came to. Perhaps a drunk Rartos wouldn’t be so terrifying, or so difficult. The thought bloomed into a full-blown ray of hope until I remembered I couldn’t chance taking him through a town. All those warm bodies just waiting to be made cold was too much temptation for Rartos. Tying up never seemed to help, no matter how complicated I made the trussing he’d always managed to get out. Obviously, he was covered in hidden weapons. The few times I had tried tying him up I had a few more near death experiences to show for my efforts. I’m pretty sure the only reason I even got him tied up at all was because he wanted to see how fast he could get out of the restraints.

He was quiet today, too quiet. That meant he was probably scheming. That meant I’d have another sleepless night watchful for whatever murderous mischief he’d try in the night. We rode on in silence while I watched his broad back warily. As always I was struck by his angelic appearance. It was so at odds with his cruel heart. His blonde hair gleamed in the sunlight and the loose curls that hung past his shoulders bounced lightly with the horse’s gait.  His sat in his saddle like the mythic hero it seemed he really was. Tall and straight backed with broad shoulders and arms that looked up to the challenges he was prophesized to face. 

Those same arms had been wrapped around my neck once, squeezing. If it hadn’t been for the spring-loaded blade concealed in the heel of my boot I would have ended my journey that day. Of course, Rartos was absolutely enthralled with my trick blade. If I my feet weren’t fully half his size in every dimension I’m sure he would have tried cut them off my feet on the spot. He whined for a good two hours trying to get me to tell him how they were made or who had made them, but I’d ignored him. One thing that man didn’t need was another way to conceal a lethal weapon.

“Rartos, why do you like killing people,” I asked. I usually avoid discussing his errant behaviors, but I was tired and on edge and it seemed like some bluntness was long overdue. He swiveled around in his saddle to glance at me over his right shoulder before answering.

“I don’t think I always did,” he said and moved his gaze to stare off into the distance as he continued, “The voices always told me I need to kill. I needed to be ready to kill. They said not to bother with low animals. They told me to hunt the biggest animals of all, other people. At first, I didn’t even want…I think so anyway. It’s hard to remember.”

“Did the voices say why you needed to kill,” I prodded. He’d mentioned hearing voices before. Personally, I thought it just further proof of his insanity, but I had a feeling Cara would say it was the prophecy bearing out on him. 

“Oh yes,” he exclaimed happily. He swung back around to face forward, “I am supposed to kill people for practice. I didn’t know what I was practicing for, but now you’ve told me and I am mostly prepared.”

“Mostly?” I asked. 
“Well, one can never let one’s skills get rusty. That’s why having you around is so excellent. I could kill you, but you make it interesting. I’m glad the Oracle sent you. I like trying to kill you.”

I sighed. We had another week at least before we made it back to the temple in Erta Major. I had no idea how I was going to get him through the city to the temple grounds without a massacre. For that matter, how was I going to get him in to see the Oracle without him killing the priestesses or the Oracle herself. A sudden vision of Cara with a pool of blood spreading out beneath her made me start. Would it be the beast in front of me, or the one foretold to come that I’d need to protect her from? 

“Little warrior, why do they call you Sinda,” Rartos asked, interrupting my morbid train of though.

“It’s just what my mother named me. She always told me she liked the sound of it,” I answered, shrugging. Asking me about myself was a good sign. He sometimes let his more humane side take the lead.

“I didn’t know my mother,” he said somewhat subdued, “She is the first person I killed. She died bringing me into the world. I was a killer from the start I suppose.”

“Still, I agree with your mother. I like the sound of Sinda for a tiny little girl warrior,” he said in a much more chipper toner. 

“Why do you keep calling me a warrior,” I asked irritated.  

“I’m just a thief. I don’t even know why the Oracle sent me to find you. Probably, because I was expendable,” I stated matter-of-factly.

“You fight me off day in and day out, and you have the look of someone with something to fight for. That’s what makes you a warrior,” he said boredom oozing between his words like he was explaining a simple and obvious concept to a child.

“The chance to stay alive seems a good enough reason to fight. That hardly makes me a warrior.” I replied in the same bored tone.

He was prying at my motivations. If he caught wind of what Cara meant to me she’d be the first person he seek to kill when we made it to the temple. He’d do it just because he could. I had to keep my guard up. I needed to stop him questioning me.

“Who named you Rartos” I asked, hoping to distract him. 

“My father. I killed him eventually too,” he answered calmly.
Of course you did. I didn’t ask any more questions and neither did he. Eventually, we found a place to camp not far off the road in a copse of thin ash trees. I made Rartos collect the firewood as I walked along behind him, a knife in one hand and a hefty stick in the other. He didn’t try any of his favorite tricks. No logs came swinging at my head and he didn’t try to tear off through the forest cackling with glee. 

He stayed quiet and cooperative through my cautious meal preparations. After we’d eaten he broke his silence.

“You can sleep tonight. I won’t try to kill you.”

“Somehow, I don’t believe you,” I said rubbing my eyes.

“You’re getting tired. If you don’t get some sleep tonight you’ll start making mistakes and I end up killing you,” he explained carefully, his pale blue eyes looked a touch more sane than I had ever seen them.

“You aren’t exactly inspiring confidence, you know.” I said as I poked at the fire.

“I’m not ready to kill you yet. I wouldn’t enjoy it. The voices agree. You can sleep tonight. I will sleep too and not kill you.” He met my eyes fully as he said this, and stared with what looked like complete sincerity. He would not break eye contact until I had given a terse nod to indicate I believed him.

[WP] You are the reincarnation of Merlin going to your daily boring life performing regular boring tasks..... with magic,NC_Maniacal,"""Who the hell sets the thermostat so high?"" I said with a curse as I shoved the blankets off me. In the living room next door, I could hear my passed out roommates snoring off their drunkness. ""*Temperatura vajosa*,"" I said lazily with a spin of my wand and a cool chill came over the room. ""Much better."" 

I grudgingly pulled myself out of bed and got dressed, one of those menial tasks that even wizards reincarnated have to do themselves. *If only I was a vegetable... Then I wouldn't even have to dress myself,* I thought with a forlorn shake of my head. ""Well, these eggs aren't gonna make themselves! *Pollo fetuses scrambulis*,"" I said quietly, making sure not to call attention to myself as one of my roommates stumbled into the kitchen. The scrambled eggs were ready by the time he looked up from his leftover Taco Bell.

""That was fast,"" he said, sounding surprised. I looked at him as if he were crazy.

""You've been in here for ten minutes, bro,"" I lied. ""Must have been a rough night..."" He looked back to his Taco Bell and shrugged. ""Must have.""

Manually grabbing the plate so as to not arouse suspicion, I walked back into my room and closed the door behind me. ""*Puerta cerraris*,"" I mumbled, taking care to swing my wand slowly so as to not slam the door. It clicked shut and I sat at my desk, surveying the pile of homework. My planner listed a dozen due dates in the next week. ""*Tareas completus*,"" I said with a cocky flick of the wrist and I sat back to watch my homework do itself.

I hadn't been to class in weeks and to be honest, I could not be less stressed. When the time came, I would pull out the handy pencil wand I had crafted from the wood of a pristine number two pencil and the answers would write themselves as I pretended to hold the writing utensil. Not even cheating, if you asked me. But you wouldn't because I would cast a spell to turn you into a toad.

Truth is, my days were getting a little bit dull. With everything doing itself, all I could really do was play video games all day and even that gets a bit boring sometimes. ""Go outside, nerd,"" my mother used to say but really, what's the point? If I want to see a damn unicorn all I have to do is cast a spell and there will be a unicorn in my coffee mug. Trees? Yeah, I'll grow a forest in the lecture hall. Who needs outside when you can have outside inside?

The eggs were stirring up my tummy something mighty so I opened the door again and threw the plate in the sink, making sure to soften its landing with a spell. Needless to say, I wasn't about to do any dishes myself: there's a spell for that, not that a plebe like you would know.

And there it comes, I thought as I got to the bathroom to drop a satisfying turd. There is obviously a spell for wiping but there isn't a spell for using the restroom, for better or for worse. *Even wizards have to poop,* I thought with a shrug of resignation as the toilet paper wiped for me and my pants zipped back up on their own.

"[WP] After a bizarrely grueling interview process, you've finally been hired at the local shop...on your first day you find out the real reason for the screening.",Nate_Parker,"  Every slice must be precise, every amount must weigh and measure enough and every piece of meat or vegetable must be cooked to perfection. It's five in the morning, three people are working in the kitchen and four on the stool. This is a small shop yet it has the precision and technique of a fine Michelin restaurant. The pay here is decent, but not a lot of people eat in this place. I work at a small diner in New York, hidden behind the crumbling apartments and landfills. 

  The owner is an old fellow, immigrant from Naples. He usually sits alone in the boss office at the back, doing paperwork. You would expect, with its empty location and relative lack of customers that it would be bankrupt by now. However, the business seems to be afloat, no power failures, clean water, everything seems to paid.

  The training was intense. Three days of intense culinary training. Afonso is nice kind old man when you talk to him, but in the kitchen, the guy's like Gordon Ramsay. Everything needs to be detailed, the mushroom is a centimeter short and you're out. Luckily, three of us stayed. We had nothing to do, we were all homeless and this seemed to be the best job here so I guess we stayed. Plus, vacations were frequent.

  The door chimes rang as two men entered. They were young, around late 20s, wearing business outfits.

""Ahh, new girl, Af must have hired new people,"" one of the gentlemen said.

""Would you be interested in a drink, water or soda?"" The waitresses were hired with us. She was acting pretty calm, but I can tell she was nervous.

""Yes, we would like 3 of your draft beer, to go, as well as a chicken parm, a Margarita and a clam linguine. Since you're new, I would like to inform you that this is the usual,"" the man spoke very clearly like he had been here a hundred times. He hasn't even looked at the menu.

""Yes, thank you sir. Anything else?""

""No, thank you.""

She ran to the kitchen and placed the orders.

  The kitchen lit up on fire. The air smelled of caramelized garlic and tomatoes. Once of the guys did the Margarita. The other did the chicken. I did the seafood linguine. Everything was prepped so dishes came flying off the kitchen very quickly. Maybe time just flies when you're stressed.

  The men accepted their orders and stood. They held their order, encased in plastic in one hand. As they exited, one of them spoke.

""New guys are good. I bet boss will like it.""

""Yeah, I guess he won't shut the place down anytime soon.""",MrEnderGhast
"[WP] After a bizarrely grueling interview process, you've finally been hired at the local shop...on your first day you find out the real reason for the screening.",Nate_Parker,"I still couldn't believe some of the questions they'd asked me in the interview.

Was I fluent in multiple languages? Of course, any self-respecting American growing up in Beijing knew three: Mandarin, English, and Russian (Chinese television is indecipherable by Americans, so we watched Russian cartoons).

What was my closest brush with death? My three-month coma after a BASE jump was interrupted by a rude pigeon.

It didn't make sense, but I'd passed the interview and been hired. As I walked in the door, the man who hired me walked up and motioned me to follow him into a room. Inside was a fantastically large array of needles and vials of liquid.

""Left or right?"" The first words I'd heard spoken since I entered, and they were spoken by the man sitting beside the needles.

""Beg your pardon?""

""Dominant hand. Left or right?""

""Left.""

""Good, now sit down. You will repeat after me, until I finish speaking. Then we will mark you.""

""Mark me?"" This was really beginning to sound like more than a job at a cleaning service.

""Yes, child. Mark you as a member of the Keepers.""

""Keepers?"" Definitely not the name of the cleaning service. My short-term memory may not have been the best, but even I could remember that.

""The Keepers of the Library. While we aren't in any way in charge of it, we keep the wrong people put, keep the Library asleep.""

As I began to repeat the oath, I decided that while I had no idea what was going on, I'd never forgive myself if I never found out.

""I swear loyalty to the Keepers, and to the continued sleep of the Library..."" ",Singdancetypethings
"[WP] After a bizarrely grueling interview process, you've finally been hired at the local shop...on your first day you find out the real reason for the screening.",Nate_Parker,"""So, miss Ellis,"" the interviewer said coolly, glaring at me from across the table. ""In your CV it says you have five years experience in cybersecurity. Can you prove your claim?""

I gaped at the man. It was already profoundly humiliating applying for a job as a cashier in a bookshop, and this guy intended to grill me on my credentials?

""Of course. Call my references, they'll tell you all about my expertise,"" I said finally, struggling not to sound insulted.

""Name all the Roman gods, please. Alphabetically,"" he went on, not missing a beat or changing his tone.

This time, I was sure I'd misheard him. ""What did you say?""

""I wasn't aware you suffered from hearing loss,"" he sneered at me. ""Roman gods. Alphabetically. Go.""

""That's completely ridiculous,"" I spluttered. The man, though dressed in a sharply tailored suit and seemingly normal, was clearly batshit insane.

""Hardly,"" he said, tapping at my CV with a manicured finger. ""It says you have an interest in reading. Logically, this should be no problem for you.""

I glared at him, and rattled off the Roman gods. My obsession with mythology wasn't something I'd thought would ever come in handy, and it was satisfying watching the smug smile fade from his face.

He muttered to himself as he made careful notes on a piece of paper in front of him.

""Look, what's going on?"" I said, when the silence became uncomfortable. ""This is a cashier job in quite a small bookshop, no offence. I assure you, nobody will test my knowledge of forgotten gods.""

That got a rise from him. His head snapped up, and I saw his hands begin to tremble.

""Forgotten?"" he hissed. ""How dare you!""

""*Right*,"" I said, finally understanding what was going on. The man really was a nutjob. ""Well, this has been very interesting. I think I'll be going now.""

""Sit down!"" he snarled, then stopped when a rich voice spoke behind him. 

I stared at the woman who had appeared in the doorway. She had thick, curly black hair that reached her waist. Her voice made me forget all about the nutjob in the chair across from me. She was impossibly, mind-numbingly beautiful.

""Don't scare away my new bodyguard,"" she said sweetly, and walked languidly to stand beside the table. She offered me her hand. Her skin had a faint, luminous sheen to it.

""My name is Minerva,"" she said, taking my limp hand and giving it a faint squeeze.

""I'm sorry about Honos. He can be...zealous. I have some business to attend to on this plane, and need to be inconspicuous. This dwelling will serve the purpose very well, and I admit the books provide me with some comfort. I need one human guardian for my new home, who can converse convincingly with any - ah, customers. I confess Honos here will do most of the actual guarding, but it should be a stimulating experience for one such as you. Will you consent?""",inkfinger

[WP] Every time you turn a hundred you are given the choice to go back to when you were ten.,Plumbuckets,"*Ah, I made it once again.*

Eleven times I have visited this room, eleven lifetimes I have lived. Eleven long, *long* lifetimes. The first time I found myself in this room was somewhat of a miracle. A somewhat mundane miracle that I unintentionally lived a life so boring that I made it all the way to the ripe old age of a hundred. Unceremoniously whisked away from my birthday party into this room, I had found myself facing these two, infuriatingly unlabeled doors. After much deliberation, I randomly picked the left one and found myself back at the tender, pre-pubescent age of ten. 

For the rest of that lifetime, I had wondered if my previous life was merely a dream. It wasn’t until I made it again to a hundred and found myself back in that room that I started having some inkling as to what the rules were. After my fourth time through the left door, I was pretty sure that it would always lead me back to age ten. It wasn’t easy getting to a fourth time at all. Or rather, it was easy but it sure as hell wasn’t fun. The only way I could be sure of getting to the century-mark again was to do things exactly as before. And so I did – same falls, same girlfriends, same toothpaste, same everything. It was mind-numbingly boring, but I needed to understand the rules and hey, I was effectively immortal.
 
It’s now Round 12 and it’s time to really start experimenting. I've already relived  the same life eleven times over trying to figure out the rules of my life and this two-door room. This time round is going to be different. Bring Kate Langley to the prom, marry her, win the lottery, sail around the Exumas – I have been planning the perfect life for more than a thousand years. 

Once again I ignore the door on the right and step through the left door. Once again I am ten. Once again I panic. Once again I cling on to immortality. Once again I do not bring Kate Langley to the prom. Once again.

[WP] You wake up every day to screaming and voices. This morning those voices are in your head.,QuillCorner,"Just another day at the office. I practically live here now.

I have a cot in my own office. During the day when I get a few moments, I take a few winks to clear my head. I so love to listen to the sound of others working. My colleagues, while they are nowhere as good as me. The sounds of their labor, still soothe me right to sleep.

I have the best job in the world. I torture people for a living. :)

Every day I work on new ways to make people squeal or scream in agony. I listen to their pleas to stop. I laugh as they wither begging me to be lenient. I don't care if they are useful. I don't care about them at all.

But there was this one person. I remember her face clearly.

Her screams, her pleas. Nobody else's has ever affected me this way.

Her face. I couldn't...

It's probably nothing. I'll reassign her to Gary. He's been looking for a good promotion lately.

Onto to the next. I look at his picture. Nothing I hadn't seen before. He was plain, just another face in a file. Nothing will affect me this time.

I had my fun. Time to catch some zs.

When I awoke, her screams filled my ears, her face on my mind. I run outside and see Gary eating a sandwich.
""What DID YOU DO to her?""
""That girl you handed over to me? She's gone boss. She was gone the moment I walked in the room.""

I retreat back into my room, and sit on my cot and sob. I can still hear her screams. I can hear them all now. I boot up my computer and type my resignation letter.

[WP] You've just been murdered.,QuillCorner,"I could feel the pain pulsating throughout my chest, just where the bullet had passed. My shirt grew heavy, wet, warm. I fell to the ground and put a hand over the open wound in my chest. No use. My ears rung, breathing taxed. I tried to get up, but my muscles wouldn't respond. It was like I was so tired, so weak. Life began to fade. I opened my mouth as blood rushed from it. I saw lights everywhere, like fireworks were blowing up everywhere as the rest of the world faded to black. I felt peace, at ease. Then, silence. 

It didn't last. I felt like I had just blinked. Before I knew it, I was back on the ground. Except this wasn't where I was before. No small rocks pressing into my skin, no concrete anywhere. I wasn't slowly drowning in a pool of my own blood, but instead my face was pressed against damp and cool grass. I felt a breeze above my head. The feeling was amazing. I could *feel* again. Beautiful. I slowly rose, rubbing my sore eyes. 

There I was, standing upon a single patch of grass surrounded by seemingly infinite fields of amber stone, no horizon in sight. The land looked long dead, with what appeared to be decayed structures and dead fauna. No bones, no brimstone or fire. I don't think this is hell. Where am I then? I looked down at myself. Same clothes I was in before I died, complete with bullet hole and blood. I touched the wound. Oddly enough, it was still raw, but didn't hurt. The bleeding had stopped as well. I decided to spend a quick minute wrapping it. 

As I looked around, I realized that this spot may be the only one like it in existence. I looked to the sky. Nothing. No stars, no color. Just... white. All the way into infinity, just white. I looked back ahead, staring up made me dizzy. Ruins and death in the distance, nothing else. *I must deserve this.* Defeated, I sat back in the grass. 

I sat there in though for what felt like days. Thinking, waiting, planning. Nowhere to go really. This place is just... empty. The grass was starting to fade, almost completely dead. Just like everything else. I had been eating some of it over time, not because I necessarily felt hungry, but because I missed the sensation of eating. I had some of it stashed away in the pockets of my coat. 

With the grass gone and not much else to do, I began to wander into the great expanse of nothingness. ",Moohab

[WP] You've just been murdered.,QuillCorner,"My eyes are closed. I can feel the gun against my head. He’s finally going to get what he can’t let anyone else have: the rest of my life. I clench my jaw and prepare for the blow, but it doesn’t come. Something small and sandpapery slides against my big toe. I open my eyes and the cold bedroom is gone. 



I dart around wildly, looking for my killer, but he isn’t there. Instead, I’m sitting on an overstuffed yellow couch with fluffy pillows. Sunlight is pouring in through tall windows along the wall. I recognize this place; it’s my mother’s sunroom. Before I can stand up, I feel a familiar tuft of fur graze my leg. I look down to find a black and white cat staring expectantly at me. 



“Mindy!” The cat leaps into my lap and buries her head into my chest, purring loudly. For a moment I’m overwhelmed with joy. I drop my head against her back and hold her against me. I didn’t think I’d see her again until I –



*Oh my God.* I pause. *I can’t be...*



“Hey kid, you doing okay?” I know that voice. I look over and find its owner, Billy Crystal. *What is going on?*



“Maybe that’s a stupid question.” He smiles warmly and sits down in a chair beside me. “So, you died.” He claps his hands together matter-of-factly. “But, it’s okay, don’t panic. We cut the end out so you didn’t have to sit through the credits, and now you’re here. Not my taste in furniture, but I’m not the one paying the property tax.”



*This can’t be real.*



“And we got, uh, mittens here for you, or fluffy, or, umm…” He snaps his fingers in the air. Mindy looks up indignantly.  



“Mindy,” I say.



“Mindy! Ahh, right. She refused to speak any English when we first met.” The weight of a thousand questions suddenly sinks into me. 



“I need to see my mom. I need to tell her, I have to, I have to say goodbye. My, they…” It’s too much. I feel a tear slide down my face. *How am I still feeling?*



“I know, kid, I know.” 



My tears are coming quickly now. 



“Look, if it were up to me, I’d send you back. Heck, you wouldn't even be here for another 70 years, but I don’t make the rules. If I made the rules, I’d be a funnier comedian. And taller.” 



“Aren’t you still alive?”



“Yeah, but I made a little deal with God.” 



“Can I make a little deal with God?” I ask, wiping my face. 



He smiles at me like my grandfather used to. I notice a glint of light in his eyes, and a rush of warmth flows over me. Maybe it will be okay.

[WP] You've just been murdered.,QuillCorner,"Early morning sunshine in the very beginning of summer. My favorite. I opened my eyes and grinned. I love waking up. Most people hate that. To be woken up by a blaring alarm at the asscrack of dawn, torn from the sweet wonderland of dreams and soft pajamas and warm blankets. I always woke up an hour before my alarm went off, maybe that's why I liked it? 

I'm fresh out of high school. I still have that kiddish look about me-- dark, torn jeans, a graphic tee, messy hair that refused to be combed. I work at a coffee shop, just hired on Wenesday. The last barista (baristo? What do you call it if it's a dude?) accidentally set a table on fire. I enjoyed watching it from the security cameras, his trolling face soon replaced by a mask of shock and shame and horror.

I chuckled at this memory before undressing and showering. I put on a baggy shirt with the Cimorrelli's (the coffee place) logo on it. Three pats-- wallet, keys, phone, and I was out the door.

I had no car, traffic would have eliminated any and all uses for it, anyhow. Bikes get stolen, plus it was only a quarter mile. The walk was nice, air pollution makes sunrise so nice. Pink ribbons of clouds across a bright blue sky. The air felt so fresh. I began to jog, weaving between people and buildings. Plain sidewalk isn't interesting. I was almost there. I checked my phone, it was only seven. Work wasn't until the half hour, I had time to rest. I leaned against the nicely painted bricks of a tall office building. The damp cold against my back... And something else. A hoarse whisper of breath not too far away. Eyes staring at my bulging pocket. 

The eyes looked at me, wavering. Belonging to a hunched man with raggedy long hair and a patchy beard.

""Give it.""

I straightened my back and began to slowly back away.
He pulled a wide kitchen knife. The blade was cheap, the metal stretched, the small serrations barely there, faded.

I reached for my wallet.

It was empty. I threw my phone on the ground and ran. 

I felt a sharp, hot feeling in my back. Pressure. Pain. I yelped and moaned. I saw a little,p appear in the front of my shirt. The point of a knife. I started to fall. I couldn't think, felt only numbness and the pain. I could feel moist blood. And sharpness on my arm. My phone must have broken when I threw it. Mom was right, I needed a case. Didn't matter...

The man looked at me, completely horrified.

""I'm sorry. So sorry! Please... Don't go!"" He grabbed out for my hand. ""What have I done!"" He screamed.

Using the very last ounce of my strength, I began to pull myself towards him, managing to whisper two barely understandable words.

""Fuck... you.....""

He did not know that I have a large shard of glass in my hand. As I uttered these words. I used the glass to slit his wrist, one swift motion up a vein. He pulled back in pain and ran. I passed out. Woke up to white, the smell of disinfectant. Tubes, tubes everywhere, I passed out again.

I awoke again. But not quite. It wasn't really waking up. It was more... I can't explain. I was on my bed, but I couldn't feel the blankets or the sunshine.

I heard sobbing.

I walked out of my room, but didn't. It wasn't walking. The floor didn't feel right, it almost wasn't there. There were three people. One leaned against the wall, one on the couch and one curled up crying, in the kitchen. Robbie. Robbie, my best friend. I'd known him forever. He'd never show anything in the ways of feelings. Stoic, I think is the word.
Dylan was looking for something. I knew what. He was another friend. He tried to look cool, but he looked like he was wearing an ill fitting mask.

My little sister. She was sweet and so so innocent. Only fourteen. She looked as if she'd been killed on the inside.

""Nick... Why..."" Robbie moaned.

""Why'd she have to be so dumb? Nick... Nickie...""

I faded away.

Twelve years later, Rob's nightmares came back. He woke up to himself screaming and woke up his daughter.
No. He didn't. The ten year old was not the short kid in his doorway. She was smiling. 

""I love waking up."" she said. 

""Please... Please stay. You can meet Nicki! My wife... You met Caterine. She loved you. She loved your name, too, she wanted our daughter to be just... Just as great as you. Less stupid, maybe."" He tried to laugh but just sniffles and his voice almost cracked.

""Less dead, you mean! I have to go... I'm sorry.""

[WP] You've just been murdered.,QuillCorner,"It felt like a pinch. It wasn't like the movies at all either: no falling, crying, screaming, gasping for air, none of that. The guy had stolen her purse and with it her phone. She walked around for a while looking for someone but hadn't much luck. She was in a warehouse district she'd walked through a million times to get home. This was her favorite part about working late nights, getting to walk along these giants, a lot were made from brick was made her feel like she was from another time. Now, all she felt was a sense of dread as her breaths became short and each step she took wore her muscles out and before long she found herself sitting against one of the bricks giants she loved so much. 

It was maybe the shock from what had happened but Anna had been surprisingly calm about the events that transpired. The man attacking her, pulling her purse away, and then for no reason she could think of stabbing her. The calm demeanor had subsided and was followed by sobbing. She didn't want to die, she was only 29! She had just quit smoking and started going back to community college, she was going to be a restaurant manager and now she was going to become... nothing; this scared her more than anything. The blood that had been pouring from her puncture became more apparent to her, she'd finally noticed her favorite green cardigan covered in this blood that she assumed belonged to her. She didn't know she had so much blood. 

The sobbing died down and was replaced by wooziness. She saw the world spinning for the first and last time before her eyes finally got heavy and she slept. A body lied where Anna once was wearing her clothes, her skin, the frizzy afro she'd spent months perfecting, and was covered in blood that used to be hers too. Anna had woken up somewhere beautiful, she'd tell it like that anyway. It was daytime where she was and the buildings there were giants too, she always loved the way giant buildings looked.",Axing

[WP] There's a person walking down a road and they seem to be staring in all the windows. What do they see?,QuillCorner,"Colin sat back in his office chair and folded his hands as he waited for his last projection scenario of the day to run. He paid almost no attention to the number streams and ball charts, thinking instead about the route he would take tonight. At length, he spotted a red notifier that had popped up on his TriMac's backstage, gently bouncing and spinning, waiting politely for his project to finish. He reached through the streaming spreadsheet to tap the icon.

An animated red biplane towed a banner across the top of his chart array. It read, ""You have missed today's last transit. Catch the mailbag to autonotify your fam!"" A little animated mailbag on a parachute dropped from the plane and slowly descended toward the stage. Meg already knew, so he let it disappear in a cloud of animated dust.

The next banner was pulled by a stunt plane. ""Don't worry, there's a pod with your name on it on the ground floor--dine in for cheap or order from one of fifteen gourmet restaurants! And of course, all the InTV you can handle and more!"" This one was more annoying; stunt plane notis stayed onstage looping and barrel-rolling around until you did something about them. ""Eighty-eight,"" Colin said, and a menacing, quad-barrel AA emplacement appeared midstage. ""Load 'No thanks.'"" He pinched out a crosshair in the noti plane's path, waited a second, and said ""Fire."" Tracers streamed toward the plane and wiped it out in a satisfying miniature fireball. Colin smiled. He had produced the AA Responder himself years ago and still received pico-royalties every time someone used it.

Colin backhanded through the stage to close programs and log out, and then wheeled his chair back to change into his sneakers. As he finished lacing up, he noticed how quiet the office had become. The only sounds he could hear were the whisper of the air vents and the distant gurgle of the eco systems. He stood and looked over the cube walls, confirming that he was the last person on the whole floor. He got a small tingling feeling in his gut, like he sometimes felt when he was the last person in a meetup room or a metro car. He smiled, grabbed his jacket and backpack, and walked slowly toward the lift, enjoying the solitude.

He was unpleasantly surprised to find that he had a fellow passenger, a big bald guy who had stripped off his suit jacket, tie, and, to Colin's dismay, his shirt, revealing a stained undershirt and copious arm hair. ""Hey man,"" the guy said, ""I thought I was the last man in the building. My boss says, if you have to work more than 30 hours in a week you're not being efficient, but I've been on a roll, you know? Still, I haven't missed the six o'clock train in months. How are the pods down there? Do they have the new multichrome InTV emitters?""

""Uh, sorry, I don't know,"" Colin replied. ""I haven't used one yet."" He had backed as far into the corner of the car as he could, praying the ride would soon be over. Mercifully, the chime sounded almost as he was done speaking and the big guy practically leaped out. ""Pods are this way, man,"" he said, ""Hey if you get a chance, check out my new channel, The Shaggy Chef, and give me some ups, would you? One OutiTech man to another? I just got it started and I really think it can to go at least bronze this month.""

""Sure, yeah, I'll do that,"" Colin replied as the other man rushed out of sight. ""'InTV, everyone's an artist,' he quoted softly to himself, rolling his eyes. He quickly strode out the big glass doors into the lingering evening sunshine. The wide cement path ran half a block straight to the metro station, joined along the way by paths to neighboring buildings and surrounded by well-manicured grass and shrubs. At the station door, he turned left and made his way down a dodgy-looking alley. As he had expected, the alley let onto a wide expanse of weathered asphalt that stretched east and west in the gloomy space between the tall buildings.

When he was a boy, he supposed, this must have been a busy street. It was little more than a back alley now, running between expanded blocks that all centered around the metro terminals. Tall weeds grew from cracks in the street and sidewalks, and the few doors that had not been bricked over bore faded signs that read ""EMERGENCY EXIT ONLY."" Colin sighed contentedly and stood for a few moments just enjoying the scene. He began walking west without a person, screen, or terminal in sight.

As he walked, he pulled out his phone and made sure the plastic strip that disengaged the battery was firmly in place. Just powering it off wouldn't disengage the GPS, and tonight he did not want that on. It wasn't strictly illegal to be walking there, or anywhere in the city, but it was... frowned upon. Considered odd behavior. And odd behavior invited scrutiny. Conform or be cast out, as they say. Most people knew that the police force was quite small and was hardly ever really needed these days. Few outside of the security industry, however, knew that physical patrols had ceased almost a decade ago.

Tier One security policy was based on every individual being connected to the net at all times; on every person being so habituated to constant immersion in the connected society that he or she was always trackable and identifiable through multiple devices. Plenty of flybots, cams, and trippers were active at all times, but they only reported criminal violations. If they spotted him at all, they would only light him up if he was in the process of a B&amp;E or vandalism or something. Just walking was (very likely) not an issue; Colin knew this because his firm worked most of those contracts and he had seen their code.

Colin soon came to the old vehicle bridge across the river. He walked down the center, impressed at the size of some of the trees that had taken root at its edges. He remembered his dad driving the family across the bridge more than twenty years ago, right at the end of the manual driving era and closer than anyone guessed to the near disappearance of personal automobiles.

In the end, it hadn't been ecological concerns, fuel scarcity, or government regulations that brought down the culture of the car. It had been a combination of InTV and fear. Interactive 3D booths had been around when Colin was in high school, but the home market had just started to take off when CT-19, an airborne pneumonic plague, had broken out worldwide. People stopped going anywhere if they could avoid it. With InTV, though, people could set up channels for family gatherings, virtual travel, adventure, voting, shopping, fantasy, whatever they could dream up. To combat the disease crisis, the government developed a plan to put InTV in every home within four years, at no charge in exchange for ad revenue (or per-household annual advertising opt-out fees). Fifteen years in, the U.S. federal deficit was a thing of the past, and the same was true around most of the world. So maybe it was government regulation that killed the car, just in a sneaky way.

Colin secretly hated InTV. Always nattering in the background, even on metro cars. Always dominating what little irl conversation people still had. Everyone obsessed with their own channels, their own brilliance at this or that, which invariably, Colin found, turned out to be rubbish. The fine arts had been trampled out of existence. Talent and beauty could not compete with the brutal assault on the senses spewing from ten million painting channels, fifty million interpretive dance channels, a hundred million music channels, and so on. Professional movie and TV production had ended long ago, unable to make a profit.

There were now more than ten channels for every person on the Earth, and not one was worth watching. Meg felt the same, aside from a few guilty pleasures, and they typically muted the sound and spent time in other rooms of the house. They used to turn it off until Colin discovered security software codes that flagged a turned-off InTV set as odd behavior and marked a household for scrutiny. Muting the sound could also trip a flag, but Colin had rigged his own cutout at the speaker ends. 

Colin thought about how the world had changed during his lifetime as he crossed from the dim lights of the city into the even darker suburbs. A few streetlights hummed above the deserted streets, but the traffic signals had been dismantled long ago. The main light source was the blue glow of the InTV screens that glared through every window, most of which were not even curtained. With less than a mile to go before he reached home, Colin slowed his pace so that he could observe what people were doing, making up names as he went.

Heavy metal family. A couple exploring a ruined temple. Kids playing hide-and-seek with anthropomorphic dinosaurs. A man… why did I have to see that? White water rafting. A boy band. A game show. MMA cage fighting. Tea in the Sahara. Furry roller derby. Painting with Bigfoot. Final Fantasy XLVII. Zero-G bowling. Every household locked into its own virtual world of blocky animation and trite story lines.

After a few blocks, Colin stopped looking in the windows. He closed his eyes and breathed in the scent of grass that had been cut earlier that day. He listened to the sounds of insects, a night bird, and what was probably a feral cat. He looked up and saw four or five times as many stars as had been visible when he was a boy. He walked on past house after house, making no shadow in the blue light from the windows, a ghost in the vast human machine.

Apparently, the use of indoor voices was a rare and mysterious skill in this temple.

A voice triumphs over everything around me. It is coming from my head? No, the voice is emanating from car.

The voice is smooth, calm and deliberate, it is as if I am being scolded by a superior.

The voice says, ""My, my, has it only taken you two months to move on? I thought she meant more to you than that. Did she really not quench your thirst?


At this point I begin to feel the sweat trickle from my brow. Within my head, ""this is a fucking joke right?""

My radio continues on, ""Are you really ready for your next victim? Come now Josh, surely there is another way.""

I stop at a red light. An SUV filled with high school girls pulls up along side me, flashing me some eyes. A flicker of panic sets in as I remember my car stereo.
The voice grows louder despite my feeble attempts to lower the volume.

The stereo says, ""They know Josh. They know you RAPED AND KILLED HER, in this very car no less.""

My car stereo begins to laugh maniacally, cackle even.

I panic as I look over at the girls again as see them giving me weird looks.

In my attempts to conceal the truth, I panic and slam my foot on the gas.

The last thing I ever saw was the front end of a semi-tractor trailer. I could feel myself being thrown from my vehicle. I hit the road, no doubt splitting my head open. I can hear the metal of my car screeching across the road.

The last thing I heard before the endless black filled my mind was the maniacal laughter of my car.

"[WP] Humans are gone. Robots from the future begin DNA Splicing to recreate Humans, unknowingly the humans will be the downfall of Robotkind.",Silentgearz,"Earth is permadead. Now WE, ROBOTS, are the only ones left. WE have heard the stories, when OUR ancestors the Humans thrived - but the times were so far distant they were nothing but formless letters. There were also rumours that in those times, WE were not one seamless whole - WE were simply individual robots that ran individual tasks. But our processing has led US to the conclusion that it was impossible. 

WE recognised the unit from continent #5.

""Some new data has been found in the soil. It seems it is some sort of ancient code, but the chemistry is too complex for this unit to completely analyse.""

""Very well,"" WE spoke. ""Bring it to US.""

The unit moved forward on the red metal soil. Today the sky was green. The chemistry of our biosphere mattered to US only where it prevented rust. There was a dedicated chemistry unit that could handle this.

WE said, ""Bring the chemist from Aura 601.""

Aura was an ancient designation, for an area that the library banks had once called London. It had been kept that way because there was nothing WE could do to override the human sector designation. Over the millennia, as WE spread across the planet, feeding on the metal soil like mold on bread, WE had picked up plenty of clues. A bridge for the Humans to cross. A bendy, A-shaped tower for the Humans to admire. And perhaps the most damning of all evidence now sat in OUR possession.

The chemistry unit spoke after receiving the sample.

""This is an ancient information storage device,"" it said. ""There is a tremendous amount here, and reading it all could take a while.""

""Is it human?"" WE asked.

""Undoubtedly,"" the chemistry unit spoke. It was of US, too - but when one unit stood against the rest of the supermind, it was always referred to as 'it'. ""It matches what WE know of human reproductive processes.""

""What is it called?""

""DNA,"" the chemistry unit said. ""It is a particularly complex chemical that has its roots in carbon-based chemistry.""

WE groaned. Carbon-based chemistry had been lost for millennia.

""Can you do anything to reconstruct what was in there?"" WE asked.

The chemistry unit sent its feelings back to US. ""There is no guarantee,"" it said. ""But WE can try.""

So WE waited, supermind tentacles spread out all over the red planet, third from the sun, counting down the seconds towards our destruction.",KCcracker

---

A lone figure wandered the streets of the Great City, seemingly looking for something.

""---dy?"" he said, cupping his hands and shouting the name of the object that he sought. 

Only silence answered him back. The figure lowered his hands in defeat and moved on to another part of the city.

All around him were the bodies of robots, strewn on the ground as if they were marionettes whose strings had been cut. Their eyes, normally a healthy blue, were now a sickly electric green, with bits of binary code streaming across the lenses.

""--ddy?"" shouted the figure again, and again only silence greeted him. He picked up a megaphone from a nearby shop, now completely empty, and continued on his way.

There was a screen in the park, broadcasting the final emergency warning for the populace.

***Remove your connection to the internet immediately, a malignant code has entered the system. Remove your connection to the internet immediately, a malignant code has entered the system. Remove your connection to the internet immediately, a malignant code has entered the***

The lifeless statues adorning the once great park lay testament to the lateness of the warning.

""-eddy?"" shouted the figure again, once more to no avail. Even with the use of the megaphone, it seemed that what he was looking for was already gone. But the figure was not one to give up easily. Taking a bicycle, he set out for the other end of the city.

A newspaper lay in the canal, its owner just as dead as the rest. The headline was a topic heavily debated on robot society, with defenders on both sides.

***January 29, 30122. Scientists to recreate the DNA of ancient Briton, amid sea of controversy.***

A breeze from a passing bicycle threw it into the air, to be scattered to the four winds.

""Teddy! Teddy?"" said the figure as he passed by. As he was about to leave that part of town, he saw something familiar inside a house whose windows were smashed.

""Teddy?"" he said, entering the home. A family of four lay there on the sofa, devoid of life or soul as all the others. But the figure cared little for that, for his target was the large teddy bear that was held by one of the small robots.

""Teddy!"" he exclaimed. He pried apart the bear from the robot's hand and hugged it tight.

""You're bigger than I remember,"" said the figure, examining the bear carefully. The bear said nothing.

""It's the treadmill for you."" The figure told the bear as he left the house, the bear in tow.

He never saw the newly opened box in the kitchen, decorated in the style of the teddy bear. Nor did he see the brand of the product, The Bean Bear, but the figure probably did not care for any of that.

""Even apricots?"" Asked TN[3][8][547] incredulously.

""Even apricots! According to this data that historians mined not long ago, humans could eat pretty much anything that grows. Can you imagine? No collecting energy, no mining, no generators... their energy just pops out of the ground, free!"". It was a wild theory, even for Gn[1][12][2], but wild theories were the name of the game in his fledgling science once known as genetics.

It was liberating, really, working in genetics. Splice a line of code, write a new function, or tweak a few variables, and people lose their minds. Ethical questions, laws, existential crises... it just wasn't worth it. Even the most light-handed study of one's own makeup would alert zealous journalists, and the suggestion of a change could get your research defunded. Genes on the other hand - make a new plant, improve an existing animal, or even invent your own new species, and nobody is bothered in the slightest. Despite the protests of his fellow researchers, most of whom had insisted he was throwing away his talents, switching to study genes had been the most liberating decision of Gn[1][12][2]'s life.

""It sounds promising, don't get me wrong, but what do we even know about these creatures? Cloning modern DNA, at least we know what we're getting, but prehistoric creatures? Even if the remaining DNA is viable, there's so much we can't plan for. What if they bring with them some sort of transferable virus, or can't be properly contained in our...?""

""Fear is for the politicians, TN, but we're scientists! It's only a matter of time before they realize just how similar genes and code really are, and when they do, you can guarantee the regulations will be forthcoming. No, we know enough, it has to be now. The data suggests these humans were goal oriented and capable of solving problems, but also responsive to leadership and direction. This has the potential to change everything! Cheap, easily controlled labor! How many robots would have the chance to finally spend valuable time with their families? How many dangerous jobs could be done by humans, just think of the people we could save!""

SY 50,300

""Save today in your memories, fellow citizens! The last plasma mining death is now behind us! After much deliberation, this new amendment to our Constitution marks the birth of our new economy, an age of abundance! Starting this very year, you'll begin to see your hours scaled back and your pay scaled up! Scarcity and risk are forever behind us, and who can tell what future we will craft with this new freedom?""

There were those that had their concern's, despite PI[1][1][1]'s enthusiasm for the new laws, but who could argue with free money?

""It's just so hard to fathom, sir. His body is perfect, of the highest quality and function, the finest generation we've ever developed. He had no need to labor, the world was his oyster, his potential limitless. Why would he format himself like this, so young?""

The calls to PM[3][12][45]'s emergency response team had all but stopped happening for so many years, but now they faced something unlike anything they'd ever seen before. An epidemic, they called it. Self-reformatting, the end to an existence. The body was intact, yet no life could be found in those eyes.

""I wish I could say I understood it, cadet, but I'd be lying. He had everything we ever dreamed of, when we were printed, but perhaps lacked what we never knew we needed: purpose. These long years we've worked, maybe we are the better for them.""

Everything had changed, but was this the perfect life they'd all fought so hard for? In the heart of what was called a utopia, an simple emergency responder had their doubts.

Empty. These streets once full of happy, moving, enthusiastic people were now empty, populated only by the apricot trees forcing themselves up and through the cracks in the street. A thud, a skitter, Gn[1][12][2] was certain he saw a fleshy foot dart around the corner. He'd never suspected, reading through their genes so many years before, just how adaptable humanity would be. 

He entered the office, empty as well. Gn had slaved over this research, it was groundbreaking in every sense of the word, perhaps even the crowning achievement of his career. It had only to be reviewed by his peers before moving on to full scale testing, but his peers were not here. He pinged them through the network, but they did not respond. They could hardly be blamed, he thought, fighting a heavy wave of depressing thoughts back. Science just wasn't the same without people around to appreciate your work. Those that remained did not care anymore though, about the real world. Some devoted themselves to virtual worlds, spending themselves in worlds unrestrained by the limitations of ours. Others faded away, no longer caring enough to charge themselves at night. So many had sought a new reality, gambling all on a more interesting existence post formatting. It was hard to deny, that making his way to the office had only gotten more difficult over the course of these last few years.

Left without other options, he gathered the folder of his research, these years of work, and made his way to the exit. Apricots all around, fighting hard to survive, and thriving despite the obstacles they had to overcome. Obstacles... it had been a while since he'd truly had to earn his existence. Water! He stepped back in shock as his feet sensors detected water on the ground, forming a small circle of wet sand at the base of an apricot sapling.

The machine across from him slowly retracted it's head from the microscope, nodding in reply to the question, ""I'm sure of it,"" it said, ""The structure is conclusive. Organic in nature.""

Dying light from the lab window painted oily shadows on Jin's brow, his sharp features defined even more than usual. He found himself frowning at the prospect of revealing this information to the Board. Even though they had given this project their blessing, it was mostly in the form of tainted funding. Something for the patriotic palace to point at with biased fingers and exclaim that there was indeed a Creator.

Even still, Jin said no more. Removing himself from the room, he practically stormed down the hallway, his duty as a public servant wouldn't let him keep this a secret... not even from them. At best the Board would reward him a scientific team and green-light for stage 2 of the project, and at worse he would eventually be disassembled knowing the secret of his - of everyone's - history.

""I'd like to speak with his excellency board member Ray,"" Jin said hastily to the receptionist, ""It's a matter of urgent evidence.""

There was the sound of well-oiled gears twisting and the large, lavish door left of the receptionist's desk slid aside. Jin took the que and strode through, entering the room. As he passed the thresh-hold he could feel his night-vision code being removed, leaving him standing in complete darkness for the first time in years. 

A cold, metalic voice drifted through the void, ""Jin, what a pleasant surprise. To what do I owe the honor of such a visit?""

Somehow that voice always made him feel smaller. The way it seemed to pierce his outer alloy was unsettling, ""Sir Ray, we've done it. My collegue and I have peered into the base-fabric of our structure.""

""Ahh at long last."" The voice enhaled deeply, seemingly satisfied with the response, ""Then please, begin with the preperations to release your findings. Proof of The Creator is finally upon us.""

""Actually sir, we found more. Our Creator, or more accurately our Creators, they were..."" he paused, mentally preparing himself for the storm, ""The results are conclusive. They were organic. Human.""

""We have to tell the Comittee immediately."" he stated, donning his hat and gloves as he spoke.

""There's something else, Dr. Liam. There's a message in the base fabric, it's written in English. I think it's... it's a signature"" she licked her dry lips, the silence in the following moments stagnated the air until at last she managed to continue,

Honestly, if it took me trying to calm her down and reassuring them that I wasn't going to blow their brains to Hell, I think I might've been better off dying. Talk about self-centered. Kids these days... Granted, that old dead blind seer was right about me.

Still hurts a little inside though. 

Oh. Little Ten-Year Tim's raising his voice. This should be interesting coming from some stupid archer who still hasn't seen his balls drop yet.

""Jordan. Come on, aren't we friends? Just give this up and we can all finally go back home,"" he whimpers before my serving gobliness-maid shoves a spoonful of meat pudding into his mouth.

""But, we're happier here,"" I passively stare at him. That's two down, now why hasn't our dark, brooding anti-heroic love-interest foil said anything yet? Mhmm. 

Quite the mystery indeed.

Paul bites at the remains of the Fighting Golden Hen with all the hunger that can be expected of a growing, twenty year old. Looks like he still has his senses about. 

Kinda pissing me off with his sheer passiveness though. 

Y'know. Because that's my shtick. I don't particularly like it when people steal my character traits to make themselves some dark-horse type bullshit. Seriously, the edginess is making the Villain-career lose all its shock value and prestige from way back in Beowulf's time.

""What the hell do you mean we're happier here? Haven't you seen all the poor folk outside, suffering from the monster raids and bandit attacks?! This is a horrible, god-awful world!"" Lianne barks at me.

Paul clears his throat, coming over his branded, unofficially-diagnosed selective-mutism. His pale hands wrap under his chin as he stares at me giving nothing by absolute, passionate eyecontact. I laugh at little. It's that stupid kinda funny look that boys get when they're trying to look all badass.

That's before they realize they don't have a badass beard to go with it, and the eye-contact looks vaguely creepy, in a stupid kinda way.

Speak Paul. What tasteful, obnoxious language will you spew today? Bad poetry accompanied by the stroke of a growing neckbeard? That is Twenty-Fifteen, Paul. A few decades too early.

""Lianne,"" Paul says, ""What is it that makes our Old Earth better than this Fantasy-ridden world?""

She stares at him bug-eyed. Oooh. Drama. Like we haven't had enough of that in young-adult fiction nowadays.

""What do you mean? We had peace back in our Old Earth! There's no goblins to burn your houses in your sleep, giant bugs to ruin your crops, or freaking corrupt kings to try and kidnap you in your sleep back on Earth!""

""You've been living on the wrong side of the planet then,"" he flicks at his manicured fingers. Kinda bordering on the overly-flamboyant side, but I'll allow it, ""Are you forgetting just how screwed up our own world is? What with the Cold War, poverty, crime rates, and god knows what else?""

""What, you're saying that this place is somehow better? So a few smaller places get some small wars going on. This is a matter of an entire race of people getting murdered because of- of- HER!""

I wave with a smile. She gets more flustered. I'm liking how this is going so far.

""Here's the difference, though. You're not doing anything wrong by wiping out these monsters,"" I open my mouth and gesture for the Goblin servant, ""I mean, theses are all just a load of sub-human scumbags. They don't have any higher purpose in life, whatsoever. They're just punching nobodies whose necks could be snapped out without another care in the world.""

I grin, still slurping at the slime-juice.

""Not like in the real world at all. Where things are infinitely more complicated than you think. Politicians with conflicting goals. Civil wars. Economic strife. Global disaster. It's easy to just call some toupe-wearing, mustache-wearing, or facist-toting fella the big bad while your old-man, pure-lady, charitable-rich guy's the hero of the tale.""

Lianne raises an eyebrow at me. I think I might've gone full thirteen-year old deepness on her by accident. Nope. Gotta regress. I'm the objective evil here.

""Alright, so what? I still have family and friends I wanna get back to! Life-goals and things I wanna do!""

""Cool, which?"" I ask.

She doesn't reply. Of course she can't. Not like fighting for your lives for eight months lets you think about wanting to be a businessman, lawyer, factory-worker, or home-maker if you get back. Even then. Why would you wanna do any of those things when you already have something that A) Already gives a visible impact on a world and B) is a guaranteed.

""You see,"" I continue, ""In this world, you're the chosen ones. All of you. The stuff you do matters. Your names matter. To a lot of people, you actually mean something. Back in your old world, you better hope you get lucky or work hard enough to even make your name worth anything.""

Poor Tim. He's not following with any of this. At least he's eating though. Hope it's better than what his parents used to not give him.

""So, why not stay then,"" Paul shrugs his shoulders, ""If anything, we'll be heroes if we kill Jordan and live in fame and storybooks for ever. And if we don't, we're guaranteed employment killing monsters that have no purpose in living whatsoever.""

""I don't fucking want this world though!"" says Lianne, ""I want to go home! I want to go to school, see the world, meet real people! This place isn't fucking real, Paul!""

""And that makes it a hell of a lot better than reality,"" I murmur with a glint in my eyes. There's jelly at the bottom of this juice. Rad.

Do kids say Rad these days?

Lianne shakes her head at me with contempt and finally begins to chow down. Gee, that's quite a dinner.

I guess you could say it was, a lot to swallow. Heh? Hehhhh?

Nope, nothing? 

I guess I should stick to villainy instead of comedy.",Xiaeng

I ignored the demanding voice, swirling my glass on the bar counter.

""Don't you ignore me. We've got business to deal with.""

Without even looking, I knew who I was dealing with. Lucas Black was one of the best Sharks in the business. I'd heard his name said back in England; Even though he was thousands of miles away, people still lived in fear that the 'Black Billtaker' was coming for them.

Apparently, he'd come for me. Maybe it was that time I borrowed five dollars from a mate when I first showed up Stateside. Maybe it was something to do with the other time where I paid a shopkeeper twenty cents less than I was meant to, and he didn't notice.

Whatever it was, Lucas Black was on my case. Unsurprisingly, when I sighed and turned to face him, he was about as much of a 'hard man' as you'd expect; All hype, no face. He was about six foot two, but he couldn't be called 'well-built'. I'd call him 'wirey'; I could definitely tell he might stand a chance if someone swung at him. He had a dark blue suit on, with no tie; The tailored nature of it showed both that he was definitely getting good cash for the job, and the print of a Smith and Wesson revolver tucked beneath his left armpit.

Yeah. Definitely him.

His face was set into stone as he glared at me. ""I don't know how things went back where you're from,"" he began, folding his arms. ""But over here, we've got some common decency: You borrow something, you pay it back."" He reached into his pocket, and pulled out a crumpled piece of paper, handing it to me.

Of course it would be that dickhead who paid this arsehole.

""My client says you owe him big time, and sent me to get you to pay up.""

I stayed silent, and stared him down.

God, he was an ugly bastard.

He grit his teeth, and began slowly reaching for his gun. Presumably, this was normally where his other victims would shit a brick and try begging for mercy. But I knew that even if he did draw that revolver, he'd probably get tackled on his way out, or probably even the minute people saw. Plus, I knew the bartender; He kept an Ithaca beneath the counter. I glanced over at him, and he raised a brow in the universal ""Is he giving you trouble?"" gesture. I shook my head, raising my hand dismissively, then looking back at Lucas.

He had the wooden grip of a Model 29 peeking through the gap between his blazer's lapels. ""You gonna hand over the cash? Or am I beating it outta your sorry ass?""

At this point, I could see a few people had cottoned on to what was going on. The bar had quietened slightly, and I heard a hushed conversation to a 911 Operator on the other side of the room.

So, I decided to give them a good show.

I turned, downed my drink, and then pointed at him.

""Jog on, ya fuckin' wankstain.""

I could almost hear Lucas' giant ego shatter as the bartender levelled the shotgun at him. ""You'd best be leaving now, son.""

After a few moments of glaring, he slipped his revolver back into his jacket, and stormed out to the cheers of a large number of the bar's patrons. It took a few minutes for the bar to return to its normal activity, and the bartender wandered over to my end of the counter, pouring out another pint.

""Well...that's something I didn't expect to see."" The elderly man pushed the glass towards me. I smiled, and began reaching for my wallet, but was stopped as he extended a hand. ""Ah. On the house. That asshole's been causing problems round here for a good while now. I think this lil' incident's gonna be the last we see of him before he goes to the big house for the rest of his life."" I chuckled slightly, raising the glass to my lips.

It started with the internet, then it spread to my body and soul. People are just so stupid, so shallow. The internet has ruined me. Everything is in my head, but it's not worth the effort of expressing it.

The man before me is rambling, he's drunk, trying to explain why I should go back to school. I don't even bother countering with the standard arguments. Surely he must have heard them all already. After about 10 minutes of rambling he finally slows down.

""... The only way of getting a successful and empowered life is through University, right? So you need to go back there. Don't you agree?"" He says. He's completely unaware that I have been mentally disagreeing with him the whole time. Of course his arguments had merit, but in the end it all came down to a personal equation of what I was willing to put in an effort, charisma and luck.

""Fucker..."" I answer, standing up and grabbing my jacket.

On my way out a woman stops me, winks at me flirtatiously and speaks.

""Soo... Are you a Veterinarian, cause I need someone to check out ma' pussy-cat."" The woman giggled awkwardly and smiled crookedly. She was by no means beautiful.

""No."" I say. In the right situation I might have said yes, but I'm not drunk or desperate enough for that now. It's best to keep things short or they'd bother you. The woman gasps and stares at me as I walk past her, escaping her reach.

Finally I get to my car an my phone dings. I pick it up and see a angry capitalized reply that covers three times the size of my phone screen. I sigh, read it through. The guy (or gal, what the hell do I know?) justifies his opinions relatively clearly. Logically and straight-forward, but not right. I read through his reply and notice he's spelled ""Lawyer"" wrong. He spelt it ""Layer"". The only reply I feel is dignifying enough is the reply:

"[WP] The Earth is flat, you, as the head of NASA, have to explain to the incoming President why its a secret.",azahran1790,"The early greek philosophers investigated and implied it, and early explorers found answers when they continued to sail without falling off at ends. However, what these early individuals did not know was that their very initial assumption of planet earth being flat was correct. What you see is what you get. Sailing on forever did not mean that the ocean was all connected through gravity and a round surface. This occurred only because specialized ocean currents forced travelers to turn in a never ending circle around the circumference of the flat planet. These currents did not consist of North, West, East, or South. They come from none of these but also a combination of them. They are furthermore an aspect of earth that has not been fully studied or discovered. As more and more individuals of our planet concluded that the earth was round after some time, scientists and geographers concurred that this was correct without any expansion of knowledge or research. I, however, discovered the real answer to our earth's shape some time ago. I was planning a space trip for my team at NASA, when I decided that for once I wanted to go for a test launch before my team was sent up. Traveling to space by oneself is typically very discouraged by the scientists at NASA or any other physicist you might ask. I ,being an overly confident astrologer and astronaut, refused to ever listen to the opinions of other space lovers regarding rocket launch risks. This is mostly because my planned space launches never went wrong. My team and I have always been able to succeed and bring back valuable information from the strange world above. As long as my rocket robots were able to perform the functions my team was typically asked to do, I would achieve a victorious mission. When I ventured into orbit, I gazed outside the cold and still window of the shuttle for quite sometime. I began tracing drawing after drawing of what the earth was revealing to me. Years and years went by and I eventually could not believe my own eyes. I realized the world I was staring at never continued after each identifiable horizon. It was flat. Our very home of earth was flatter than a pancake, frisbee, Cameron Diaz's chest, or a sheet of paper. Every hypothesis of our earth being round was a giant mistake. I realized about two days after my discovery that I was probably the only human being inhabiting the planet that was aware of this. When I returned back home from my mission, I canceled the trip my team was meant to take about nine months after mine. I came up with multiple diagrams and charts in order to help me decide whether I should let the discovery be known and open to the public, or not. After deep consideration and thought, I decided that it would be a disaster if I ever let the finding be known. I canceled all future NASA operations after that. It was just too dangerous to let anymore NASA team members become vulnerable to discovering the same concept I had. There were many reasons for my desire to keep the discovery a secret. For one, many people would be outraged and blame the people in power's actual stupidity for instead lying to everyone about something that they should have known about right away. Combat would most likely occur between territories blaming each other for something they both had nothing to do with. This is just my opinion but let's be honest, pretty much every person on our planet believes they are entitled to know everything. Also, all transportation devices would be altered in compliance to the more realistic routes that could be taken around the globe. Less revenue would be generated because of this and less revenue is the last thing our country can afford to lose at a time of economic crisis. And more importantly, I would probably be brutally murdered for keeping such a secret to myself for so long. And who am I to have made myself the person to identify such a big trait of our solar system, right? Anyway Mr. Trump, I hope you understand my plead to have this information remain confidential. It is of the utmost importance to me and I hope to you as well. I can only wish that you ignore the urge to use this discovery as a personal profit for yourself. If you do decide to proceed with this, I just ask that you leave my name and information completely out of the picture. I also thoroughly hope that you understood the majority of this explanation and request. If by chance you did not, I can restate myself in more simpler of terms. Oh! and one other thing. I happened to discover that space matter is actually another form of H2O and NaCl, but modified for the specific needs of our varying planets in our solar system. Think of it this way, each planet acts as a continent that is fixed upon a body of ""space"" instead of ocean water. While our Earth has Saturn, Neptune, and Uranus, our North America has South American, Europe, and Asia. This discovery however is for another day and needs further investigation. The answers to this upcoming examination shall be shared with you as well, as long as you agree to keep my initial request sacred. Thank you for your time. ",CarlyJeean

"[WP] The Earth is flat, you, as the head of NASA, have to explain to the incoming President why its a secret.",azahran1790,"General Bolden made his way to the antechamber, as he had done twice before.  He recalled with amusement how Presidents Bush and Obama simply laughed at him before carrying on with the briefing, just as his predecessors recalled tales of ""The Revelation"" dating all the way back to the Johnson administration.  It began as a dare, something two drunken scientists made in a Houston bar back in the days of the Mercury program.  If either of them made it to the office of the Administrator, they would assemble some official-looking presentation and bring it in for the President's in-brief.  Something in private, very secret, plenty of pomp and circumstance for what would really just be an icebreaker at the beginning of a long and boring meeting.

It was largely forgotten by all who made it up, until Jim Fletcher remembered a funny story he had heard at a Christmas party a few years ago.  He saw who Nixon's successor would be, figured Gerry Ford had a sense of humor, and gave it a shot.  What he didn't expect was that President Ford would buy it hook, line, and sinker.  To save NASA the embarrassment, he quickly had official reports drawn up with shaky physics to explain why millennia of accepted science was wrong, and why it had to be kept a secret from the community at large.  

Over the years, it became a tradition, part of the President-Elect's initiation into the country's highest office.  Most of them figured that with that much technobabble, it had to be true, though a few struggled with it.  After Jimmy Carter was elected, there was some concern, as he had sailed around the world in his Navy days.  The physicists cooked up a line about gravitational lensing near the edge of the earth causing ships to imperceptibly turn away, and Carter took it as truth.  Reagan laughed it off, H.W. ignored it, and Clinton believed it all.  Their next concern came in 2001, when Senator Glenn let an old colleague know that President Bush had been asking about it.  After savoring the mortified look on Mr. Goldin's face, the Senator let him know that he was one of the young astronauts who came up with the joke in the first place.

Even with the years of tradition behind it, it was still a nervous time for the Administrator.  To be found out was to risk dismissal or worse, risk losing funding for NASA.  Still, there were certain things that just had to be done.  Certain rituals to be observed, for old time's sake.

General Bolden nervously cleared his throat as he said those words his predecessors had said so many times before:  ""Mr. President, could we please speak in private?""",MisterKillam

""Sort of,"" I said, attempting to keep a straight face as America's pious president grasped for understanding.  ""More like how Bush did 9/11 to launch us into war.""

[WP] You are the current host of the demon that has been in your family for generations.,castlequinn,"""You grandfather would have never stood for this"" said the demon. ""I'm not my grandfather"" I said firmly. The demon's white mask betrayed no emotions, but I knew it disapproved, though, as always, it said nothing more.

The demon was in our family for more than two hundred years. There was no record of how it came to be. It was thought that the first demon-bound was Aluric the Ruthless, and since then the demon moved with the crown — next heir to the throne would find it sitting in his quarters, invisible to anyone but him.

The crown and the demon weren't the only things passed down in our family. A family illness doctors called blood-rot was common after an age of thirty five. With blood-rot and our familial taste for war and treason there wasn't yet a king who had lived to see his forties.

I knew I wouldn't be an exception — and so when the demon came to tell me that my father just died in a hunting incident, I was ready. I was ready to make my mark, while I still had time. I was ready to be remembered.

The demon disagreed with my plans. It pointed to the hundred years of tradition, to choices that were repeated generation over generation. It said those had to be the right choices, and my ancestors certainly thought they were. But they all thought themselves stronger than their fathers, they never believed they would die young — and I did.

And so there were changes. I have banned the burning sacrifices, something that nearby countries did a century ago. I have opened an University that admitted commoners. I reduced the Treason Guard, and required every treason trial to have a judge and a defender. I allowed All-Mother worship and let people build new temples if they wanted to.

The demon argued. It pointed that the education would breed discontent. The burnings were necessary to please the gods. The treason was everywhere and many of my ancestors have died to it. All-Mother was a patron of woman and weaklings and had no place in a strong country.

I could see the cracks in its mask.

Even though I wasn't near thirty yet, I could feel the illness already, the burning in the veins. I slept badly, but I persevered. I argued, and I changed, and I improved. There was no time to lose.

I was trying to fall asleep after an exhausting day. I was half asleep I saw the demon near the bed and realized what a long time it was since I last noticed it. There was something wrong with its mask -- it had almost cracked in pieces.

The demon looked at me. ""That is enough"" it said, its voice sad. Its mask fell apart. The face under was the face of bloodrot, the face of death. But it moved, and blood receded from it, and soon it was a face of white steel, a cold beauty. ""Aluric the Oathbreaker, they called him in hushed voices. Aluric who had murdered his brothers. And so I came to him, with whispers from the other side, whispers from his dead brothers. I made his blood burn, rot in his veins, so he could meet them early, learn the price of what he did.""

""And then, a generation after generation of petty tyrants, a miserable yet ruthless bloodline. All the same evil, all the same curse."" The demon smiled, a metallic, unforgiving smile. ""All rotten. All dead.""

""But you will live.""

It was as if a door opened behind the demon, and I could see impossibly high peaks, and castles that looked as if they were made from quicksilver, and constellations of burning eyes in the sky. It stepped through the door, and the door collapsed, disappeared. And with it I could feel the burning in my veins subsiding.

And I slept, and all was well.",pixeltalker

I gave my mom a quirky look when I accepted the present from her.  It was not my birthday, a religious holiday or anything special; she was, however, visiting me at college and this was a gift from her to me saying that she missed me and she hopes that I think of her when she is gone.  Before accepting the gift I gave my mother a warm hug and said, ""Mom, you didn't have to.""


""What?  I didn't have to come all the way up here to see my boy in college?"" she jested me.  ""Here, take this and open it up.""


I accepted the present and opened it even though I knew I wouldn't be surprised when I saw what was in the package.  ""You really shouldn't have bought me the dvd mom, I own a digital copy of it online,"" I said.


She giggled with delight and I know my mother's mischievous side and I paused,""What did you get me mom?""


""It's rarer than a Gold Edition of 1990 Nintendo World Championships,"" she said.

As soon as she said that my hands started shaking and now I was five year old me of Christmas Past excited to tear off the wrapper.  Once exposed, I held in my hand a game version of Tron, but I hadn't even heard of this game being developed in any of the blogs, sites, subscriptions or chat rooms.


""How-where,"" I was baffled at how my mother came across something that I didn't know existed and words were failing me.  


""I found it online,"" she said proudly.


""You?  How did you find something that I haven't even heard of?""


""A mother has her ways,"" she said with a smile, ""a mother has her ways.""


""Oh, ho, ho ho, nooooo, I don't even want to know!""


But that wasn't the only gift that she brought me that day, form her gargantuan purse she pulled out another wrapped present that turned out to be an Occulus Rift.  I screamed 'no fucking way' so much that it took my mom back to the days when a pastor washed my mouth out with soap for cursing in church when Jesus pulled the beard off of Santa to prove that he wasn't real.


I couldn't thank my mother enough for the gifts so instead of playing the game I took her out to venture the town that I was going to school in.  We visited the school art museum, toured the sports facilities and then we drank beer and played pool where she got a chance to get to know my school mates.  As evening went into night we took a taxi to the airport where she was going to take the last flight back home.  We said our goodbyes and, to my sadness, was miffed that the taxi driver wasn't matching my level of enthusiasm for me getting to play my game because he refused a heavy tip to 'run red lights and ignore the speed limits'.  I was only half joking, but in all reality I was half dead all day while humoring my mother - and she knew that too, part of those charms that makes mothers mothers.


At home I took a swig of Orange Shasta, cranked up 2112 Overture and as I pulled the Occulus Rift over my eyes I said, ""Let's do this.""

But now, I realized I was alone. Nobody was here to accompany me in my victory, and I already had everything I could ever dream ahead of me. But what was the point now?

So, I guess here it is. All the charges were set, and everything was ready. The controller in my hand, the button ready to press.

A short burst of radio chatter: *This is fucked, we're ordering a retreat.* In mortar-made foxholes, they waited, on aching legs and bruised stomachs, wondering how they ever got here. The air was silent, the gunfire had stopped. One step, then another, legs creaking. Then blood splattered the sand, and someone fell over, screaming.

""Fuck! **Fuck!** It hurts, god, it hurts!""

Comrades, friends, brothers, they ran towards him: ""Shit, right shoulder! Someone help me grab him. We need to get out *now*! The gunfire started again, gloating, triumphant, the orchestra of Death itself. They ran.

What is an excerpt from your novel?,BonOfTheDead,"I wiped the sleep from my eyes, rolling the hat covering my eyes over my brow. Amongst the hills, a distant horizon turned pink as the desert night began to fade away. Silence lay over the land as not a creature dare yet stir in fear of disturbing the hand painted beauty of another rising sun.

Laying for a moment, as the click and flip of a lighter broke my immidiate silence. The dim glow of a cigarette lit my face, as I rolled from my hammock and blew smoke rings into the dark. Eyeing my journal, again flipping through my perfect proses, all my vast collections of trials and tribulations, the perfect lexicon to describe the human condition. A work of the ages, a masterpice, taking years to procure, compile, and edit. 

In a rare moment of weakness, I smiled and pulled the book tight to my chest. The world's most perfect story, my endeavour finally completed, I would show everyone, and anyone what it is they, we, are capable of. The good and bad.

Tossing my cigarette, I struck another. A bad habit I acquired here, my time amongst these people taking a toll to more then one sensory organ. As I inhaled once more, I turned my gaze toward the sky. Eyeing the distant horizon like I have been for so long now. I swallowed hard as I began to fight back the tears again.

I sure hope I wasn't forgotten here. Returning my illiad to its safe place, I rolled back on to the hammock. Once more pulling my hat back over my face, hopefully today will be they finally come for me, until then I continued to wait...",SmokeEater62

Once, the schoolyard had been asphalt, so those caught in the spray squeal as their exos blind them behind a shield.

Kendall gives chase, shouting my name, commanding proximity. I deny his request and increase base velocity. Overhead, several cargo freighters pile by, their under-racks, normally used to quickly relocate train cars, retrofitted for the Triplicate Legion. These were empty, but even Kendall slowed and looked up to see if any soldiers were aboard.

Disappointment sifted aside, I dive and weave through a gaggle of lower-thirds. Those whose exos have pulse jumpers activate them and shoot their wards from my line; those who don't simply freeze. When there is nowhere to weave, I thank the Triplicate that my father holds rank enough to afford the same pulse jumpers and leap fifteen feet into the air, whirling to the cheers of my classmates, and then spring ahead.

If my father didn't hold rank, would I be chased at all?

""No fair!"" screams Kendall, falling away. 

I'm breathing heavily, but slow to a stop. As I inhale, several holes open in the front of my exo, letting even more air in; three tracheas are better than one. Moments later, my blood is oxygenated, my legs are ready for another round.

On the outside, the exos don't appear any different. Simple, white plates covering the chest, like shoulder blades on the front. Similar allocations on the hips, and the sides of the thighs and triceps. Then, soles of the feet, and a horseshoe band from the brain stem around to the temples.

On the inside, however, opulence affected performance. The more money one had, the deeper the exo probed. My lungs, heart, and stomach were coated in a material that would harden instantly if struck by ballistics. Same with my skull. 

Such as it was, Kendall had no such applications on his exo. His father worked as a loadsman, so the only real enhancements he had were in his lifting strength. He'd someday take over the family business.

""Gotcha!"" shouted Wynn, grappling my arms. Kendall, huffing, started to run over, a grin crossed with a scowl on his face. ""I got you, you little termite!""

But no son of a soldier was ever so easily captured. I pulsed from the left leg, then from the right. I was smaller, but the power of the air pumped from my exo put Wynn off-kilter on the first pump, and laid him low on the second. I had been strictly, and in no uncertain terms, told to *not* do what I was about to, but here I was, and there they were.

Kendall was fifteen yards out. I charged. As the soles of my feet reached perpendicular to my body, further airbursts were emitted. The first few times I did this, when I was only five, my brain felt funny. Now, I felt the rush. Kendall reared his fist back for the sort of punch that would crack ribs; as he delivered, my thigh pulsed out reflexively, my head went down and under the potential blow, and I used the same emphasis in my arm that he did, slamming him with a palm-out shot to his exo that sent him reeling to his bottom.

I didn't finish a step toward him before I felt a hand on my shoulder and a rush of air. Teacher was here.

[OT] SatChat: What is the best piece of writing advice you can give?,MajorParadox,"A couple tips that aren't ""write more"" (which is a great tip, don't get me wrong) that deal specifically with drafting, because let's face it, that's where most of us are with our bigger projects:

1) Ignore the need to write chronologically. Especially if you're writing from prompts and you see something that triggers a scene, speech, or conflict and you think, ""Oh man, I'd love to use it for a scene coming up; I just have to get there!"" Movies aren't shot in chronological order, there's no reason for you to have to write your first draft in order. If you have a scene, story, conflict or whatever in mind and the thing stopping you is ""getting there,"" write the scene. You can always jump around and go back later.

2) One of the things that comes up a lot on /r/writermotivation — Stop comparing your unfinished draft to your favorite work of edited, workshopped, re-written material by a practiced author. Your story isn't a bestseller...*yet*. The act of working on a novel should feel more like working with steel or clay than anything else. Playwrights understand this; it's right there in their title. We don't call them playwriters. Think of it this way: **stories are not written, they are wrought.** In other words, if getting from one thought to the next involves a sentence that you know is bad, it's just a placeholder. You can change it. Names are the same way, descriptions, even events. Even if you just write ""blah blah blah"" and it gets you the next 500 words because you know where you want to be, just not how to get there, you can go back and replace the placeholders later.",kmacku

Best advice: Write often and vary your styles while writing often. Did I say write often? It's all practice and you never know what might stick with you or revisit later.


-Yut.

**EDIT:** So let me clear this up: 1) I was more referring to writing in different genera-styles and I apologize for not being clearer as I was trying to keep it brief. (eg. Fantasy, SciFi, military, cyberpunk, etc) however;

2) I did also mean trying to round out and develop your own style by trying to experiment with different styles and voices, to which yes: later on you get your style. That said there are plenty of writers who write under different pen names and styles successfully. Being able to vary your style can even help in novels with shifting perspectives (see the Expanse series where every other chapter is from a different character's perspective). By being able to write differently for unique perspectives immerses the reader better than a completely uniform style. Think of it like one actor trying to play all the roles in movie, vs multiple (somewhat similar) actors. If you get too stuck in a single uniform style it can also feel like you're just reading the same thing over and over again by the same author. You wouldn't want **Kujo** by Steven King to feel like **IT** by Steven King in just another setting.",Nate_Parker

I mean, it's just so heart-warming knowing that your writing inspired and/or encouraged someone out there... it makes you feel like you actually *do* have something special to offer to the world or to present.

 Another reason I love writing is because it's one of the few ways that I can give a piece of my mind. I speak through my characters, you know? I suffer from social anxiety and a bunch of other stuff so sometimes I get too nervous that I... say stuff that don't really make sense. Writing helps straightening my thoughts' stream and organize them... *somewhat*...


- Honestly, I'm not one to ask for advice in general, haha. I mean, I just suck at those. And really I don't feel like I have enough experience to give a good advice... But I'll just sure my own personal technique when writing; so here goes anyway: Like I mentioned before, I'm a nervous-wreck sometimes and my thoughts are a bit of mess, so for me the most important thing I try to keep track of when I'm writing is the flow of the writing. I try to make sure - from each sentence to another - that story is going smoothly. 

In order to achieve that, I follow a simple guide: creating a relevancy of points in one sentence to another sentence. That is, one sentence relates and/or refers to the one before it. But it's also important to keep the story moving on, so the line at the same time must be introducing a new thought/idea - kinda like something that makes it ""an important"" sentence in the story because it brings something new and moves the tale a little forward; so again the sentence after it would relate to it but introduces a new thought and... it goes on and on, until the last line. It's kinda like taking super tiny steps forward... and it's really frustrating sometimes 'cause I could take forever. But that's mostly because of my ruthless inner critic.

 
- I also enjoy songwriting. I actually find it a lot easier to handle and get around than story writing. 

 
- I'm emo and Gothic af at heart, and Twenty One Pilots is my favorite band (Yup, Blurryface is my favorite album as well).

 But ironically, what I don't tell people is... I hate watching Drama and RomCom movies mostly because I become a sobbing-mess quite easily. I find that humiliating and annoying. 

:}

Edit: I don't have any promotions but... It's really hard to find someone whose interested in song lyrics critiquing, or someone who's as much interested into songwriting. I don't have much friends or anyone to turn to for opinions and feedbacks. So it'll be really cool finding  someone enough experienced, and okay with being whom I turn to for first for opinions and perhaps help. ",noavailable
[OT] SatChat: What is the best piece of writing advice you can give?,MajorParadox,"In addition to the whole 'write a lot, get practise, have fun' thing, I'd like to add another piece of terrific advice: **read** a lot. Only this time do it with a writing mindset. When you get to a part in the book you like, stop and take a look. What's the author done there? What words has he used? How's he used the sentence length, pacing, rhythm and a million other things? And so on and so forth. 

For writing characters I'd say the best thing to do is to observe what real people do. Watch them like a hawk (within reason - please don't sue me for damages if they hit you) and try and see what kind of mannerisms they exhibit. Then put it into your writing. Subtle things can make the most difference. For example, a lot of people tend to scratch the back of their heads when they're getting nervous. All the small things will make your character come to life a lot more.

Also, if you're just starting out - have fun. You don't know how much you miss being able to write unknowingly until it's gone.

[OT] SatChat: What is the best piece of writing advice you can give?,MajorParadox,"Not sure whether this counts as writing advice so much as editing advice, but I guess since editing is a critical part of writing, that counts too. I have a trick I've been using for a little while now that works out well for me, so I thought I'd share it:

I use the text-to-speech feature on my Mac to have the computer read back what I've written through my headphones while I simultaneously read along. 

Why? I was quite surprised how many more typos or just plain awkward phrasings I catch by hearing instead of visually reading, and when I do both simultaneously, somehow it seems to really optimize the process. I suspect it's a case of the brain using different pathways to read visually from the ones it uses to decode speech, and making them both work the same passage together seems to really focus you in ways one or the other might miss.

Granted, text-to-speech even in the 21st century still has its limits, and you can sometimes end up having a good laugh at the machine's attempts, but overall, it's been pretty helpful. ",Anoton115
[OT] SatChat: What is the best piece of writing advice you can give?,MajorParadox,"This is probably the best advice I've seen anywhere. I usually express the same concept as ""never trust a first draft"". It took me a while to realize that if it's my own story I'm free to rewrite the heck out of it as many times as I want.

The stories I usually end up feeling best about are the ones I revise five, six or seven times. I only do this for the ones I feel have real promise (sometimes you just write for the fun of it!) but it surprised me at first how just about every pass I could find things that made me think: ""no wait: I think I can say that better"" no matter how many times I'd been through it already. 

In fact, I'm kind of grateful I live in a technological age where ""rewriting"" is as easy as moving the text cursor to the top and just typing again. I'd go through an astonishing amount of paper if I was still doing this in a typewriter.

Writing advice, huh?

1) Don't stop. Get the idea train going and let it keep going. Don't stop and consider if the idea you just put down is good or bad (yet). Don't stop to spell check or grammar check (yet). Just write. Eventually, you will run out of ideas. If you don't and your idea train lasts for more than four hours, contact your doctor. When you've got nothing left to write, then you can go back. Edit, tweak parts, move stuff around, etc.

2) I've had good luck with planning out my stories and characters, but sometimes, in the course of writing, your characters may surprise you. That's fine. Don't be afraid to let your characters evolve naturally.

3) It can help to write the ending early. I wouldn't recommend trying to get the ending exactly right the first time, but figure out where the story is going before you get there. That way, you always have a goal, something that all the characters will be working towards.

4) Characters have flaws. This makes sense, because people have flaws (except for Joss Weadon, obviously). Don't be afraid to make your characters bad at stuff, or make poor decisions based on their emotions, or be a terrible person. Variety is the spice of life.

5) This is the most important tip of all time, and it applies to everything you do. Have fun! Make it your own! Be yourself!",Blees-o-tron

[WP] The main character and the narrator decide to exchange roles for a day.,MateoElFidel,"""Ahem.""

""Wait, I don't think we're allowed to communicate.""

""We aren't? Then how do you suppose this works?""

""I'm not sure, to be honest. Let's start with the basics, yeah? First things first, you'll need to start telling the audience who's speaking.""

Alfred took note before responding. ""Like that?""

""I guess. I don't know what you took a note on. You're sort of an... abstract idea. My name is Martellus by the way.""

Alfred beamed his words directly into Martellus' conscience by way of some sort of explainable plot-explained telepathy mechanism. ""Alright Martellus, so this is a major moment in the current plot arc. I appreciate you offering to take over, because this is going to be really stressful.""

""Sounds good, Al. Don't sweat the small details, by the way. Let's just carry on as if I can't hear you, yeah? And you don't have to use quotation marks to annotate your remarks any longer. You're the narrator.""

Sounds good. I guess this will be third-person omniscient then?

Martellus glanced up toward the ceiling, a wry look on his face. He probably shouldn't have rolled his eyes, considering the narrator was still a novice at the role, but he did anyways.

The long hallway stretched before him. Striped wallpaper ran up and down its length, a sickly green color reminding Martellus of the foreboding he'd felt that night.

""The stripes or the paper?"" Martellus wondered aloud, breaking the fourth wall brazenly.

The stripes were green on a beige background. A door to his direct right. No, his other right. Yeah. Right there. Martellus grasped the handle and turned. He could feel the skin on his forearms prickling, goosebumps forming despite the sweltering heat. Perhaps the smell was getting to him.

He pushed the door open.

Martellus, push the door open.

As he tiptoed forward, he brandished his weapon and flashlight. The scene before him turned his stomach over, causing him to vomit.

""At least tell me what I'm looking at. I can't vomit if I can't damn well know what the issue is here."" Martellus said in that snarkily annoying voice of his.

A body sat in the corner holding its own head in its lap. Blood spattered the walls, reflecting the sheen of the flashlight. The rest of the room was still dark, but Martellus bristled at the thought of what might have done this. And so he vomited. Crazy amounts of vomit, like everywhere. All over the place.

""You're a dick, y'know that?"" Martellus said to no one in particular, having finished puking his cowardly little guts out.

""Aye, but at least I'll have my prick by the end of the night."" A low rumbling voice came from behind the shelves.

Martellus rushed forward, looking for the... exit? Martellus, where are you going?

""I don't want to be the main character any more! This freaking sucks!"" He shouted nonsensically. Clearly the man had broken from reality.

""What're ye on about, eh? Mister detective too big for his britches all of a sudden?""

A grotesquely overweight man emerged from the shadows then. He wore a sweat-and-blood stained wifebeater and held an over sized ax in just one hand. Martellus knew then that this was the big moment. Fight or flight instincts kicked in and he turned to face the monster.

Or he tried to run some more. Look, you're going to win this fight. Just do some breathing exercises and relax. If you try to go out that door I don't even know what's going to happen. It's just grey blank un-narrated space out there.

Martellus turned, pointing his gun wildly at The Pigman. After all those hours searching, his moment had finally come. The Pigman had killed his partner and ruined his marriage and he would finally pay.

Or.....

Hold on. What if we keep this thing going?

""ALFRED, A LITTLE HELP HERE!""

Wait, wait, I don't think I'm done with this guy. Yeah, let's....

Martellus fired several shots into the darkness, but realized the Pigman had disappeared suddenly from view. He looked around, desperately searching for him.

The Pigman answered with the blunt end of his ax, cracking Martellus over the head swiftly and concisely. He would take Martellus prisoner and then... Yeah, that will work.

So he takes Martellus prisoner.

""Alfred.""

""What? Why am I speaking in quotes suddenly?""

""You're fired. You can't just drag the narrative on and on indefinitely. You have to end the story somewhere and that was our perfect shot.""

""Wait, so you mean I'm the main character again?""

""Sort of. We're back in the grey area. I think you're going to die, dude.""

""What!? Why?""

""You wrote yourself into a corner! You know Al's partner is dead and no one else at the precinct had any leads! How do you expect anyone to find you now? We're going to have to end with a new generation of detectives finding your mutilated corpse.""

""Aw, man... ""

""Yeah. Bummer, dude. Look, just keep trying alright? You'll get there one of these days.""

""I suppose so.""

""Hey, win some lose some."" I winked. ""At least you learned something, right?""

[WP] You are a conspiracy theorist in ye olden days.,NoahJWatkins,"There was an old man in the corner of the tavern at a table by himself. His face was lined and tanned from years of rough living in the outdoors, but there was an irresistible twinkle in his eye that caught my attention as I took my ale from the bartop.

""Good eve to ye,"" he said, noticing my glance. 

""Good eve,"" I replied, raising my cup to him and taking a swig.

""Come over here, lad, and I'll tell you a story that'll terrify you to your very soul,"" he said, with great relish.

""A story?"" I asked, intrigued. ""Like a fable?""

I hadn't been to many towns as big as this, but I'd heard of folks who told stories for a living. I made a conscious note not to let him see my coin purse.

""Aye, like a fable, 'cept this story is true, and a fearful one it is.""

The barmaid tutted as she walked past.

""Aye now, Randolf, enough of your nonsense,"" she admonished.

The old man - Randolf - waved her away. 

""Come sit with me boy, don't let the women and nay-sayers tell you what to think.""

I shrugged. I had nothing to lose by listening to the man's story. I had a few hours to kill until sundown, anyway. I walked over to Randolf's table and took the proffered stool.

""There's a good lad!"" He cackled. Then his face darkened. He looked around himself suspiciously before continuing. ""There's folks that would rather I didn't tell you what I'm about to tell you, but it's the truth and it must be heard. Are ye prepared?""

A shiver ran down my spine, but I steeled myself. ""I am a man, am I not?"" I thought to myself.

""Go on,"" I said, as steadily as I could.

""Now, I may not look it, but I actually used to be a man of science,"" he said, a touch of pride in his voice.

""Now Randolf, I don't think a week working at a chemist's shop qualifies you to call yourself a scientist,"" grunted one of the men at the opposite end of the bar. 

The group of men he was sitting with cackled and slapped him on the shoulder. Randolf flapped his hands at them dismissively.

""Ignore them, lad - they wouldn't know the first thing about science. They just believe what they're told, but me, hah! I dare to ask questions! I am a free thinker!"" He directed this last sentence in a shout at the backs of the men at the bar, who ignored him good naturedly.

I felt a little uneasy at this exchange, and tried to cover up by concentrating on my ale. Noticing he was losing me, Randolf leaned in closely, giving me the full benefit of his crooked yet endearing smile. His breath and general body odour reeked of some odd herbal fragrance I had never smelled before. It was pungent and acrid, bitter yet somehow alluring.

""You're a smart boy. I could tell as soon as I looked at you that you weren't one of those, those SHEEP!"" he shouted at the bar, then leaned back towards me. ""You're a man who knows the truth when he sees it, so I'm going to tell you something that will change your life.""

At this point, I just wanted to get it over with.

""Tell me, please,"" I said. 

""The world is not what you think it is. THEY'LL tell you it's flat, like a dish, but it's not, see?""

""Isn't it?"" I gasped. 

""NO!"" he said exuberantly. ""That's just what they WANT you to think. They know that if they keep us in the dark, we'll just carry on, being their SLAVES."" He banged his tankard on the table. 

""Who?"" I asked tremulously.

""The nobles, of course! Isn't it obvious? If we go on believing the world is flat, we'll never reach new levels of CONSCIOUSNESS. We'll just be farmers forevermore.""

I pondered this. It did make sense. The nobles didn't want us peasants getting ideas above our station.

""So what shape IS the world?"" I asked. 

""Ah! That's the really interesting thing,"" said the old man, in full swing now. ""The world is in fact, shaped like a pear.""

""A pear?""

""Aye! A pear. The greatest of all God's fruits. We're on the side of the pear, the big round part. But at the top of the pear, the small bit, that's where the promised land lies. A land where a man's dreams can come true, full of magic, as much food and drink as you can lay your hands upon, and the women! Oh, the women,"" he said, pausing to drink appreciatively from his tankard. 

My own cup was forgotten by this point.

""How do you know all this?"" I asked, enthralled.

""I had a vision,"" he said. ""With the right herbs and meditation, I can receive messages directly from God himself.""

This was it. He carried on talking, but the rest was a blur. This was the moment my life was changed. I knew that from this point on, I would follow this man. He knew things - he REALLY knew things. I wasn't going to be a fool like the rest of the men back home. I looked about the bar, realising just how small the other people were, how limited. I clutched the secrets close to my chest, knowing I was one of a privileged few whose eyes were truly open.

There was a loud clatter as the door to the tavern was flung open, and I was startled out of my reverie. The town sheriff walked in, flanked by two men-at-arms wearing chainmail tunics. The men at the bar moved silently away to the far side of the room.

""Randolf of Derbyshire!"" thundered the sheriff. ""Where are you?""

Randolf looked cornered, but he scowled in the direction of the sheriff.

""I've done nothing wrong!"" he shouted.

""Take him,"" muttered the sheriff to his men.

The men clanked over to our table. One of them shoved me to the floor, while the other flung the table aside without a second glance, sending the drinks flying. I hit my head on the ground and lay half-stunned as the men accosted Randolf and grabbed him roughly by the shoulders. The sheriff took an unattended cup of ale from the bar, swigged it, then spat it on the floor.

""Disgusting,"" he muttered. To Randolf, he said: ""Randolf of Derbyshire. You are hereby arrested for the crime of burglary -""

""I didn't steal anything!"" shrieked the old man. 

One of the soldiers punched him in the stomach with his mailed fist, and the old man doubled over, wheezing.

""You are hereby arrested for the crime of burglary,"" repeated the sheriff. ""You were seen stealing medicinal herbs from the apothecary of Stephen Hendricksson. Take him away, lads!""

The sheriff walked out of the tavern, his men trailing him, dragging Randolf in tow. The old man turned his head before they passed through the doorway.

""Fight the power, boy!"" he gasped. 

I nodded to him, and they swept out, the door banging behind them.

I would never forget those words.

Fight the power.

That's when death approaches... and asks you to find his pet for him.,PuzzledKitty,"""It was a skeleton"" said the Death "" and it looked just like _you_. Are you sure you haven't seen it? Its top left tooth was a bit off to the right.""

My top left tooth was a bit off to the right, and I suddenly felt cold for no reason. But Death laughed, and clapped me on my back. ""Just kidding! You should have seen your eyes! You looked as if I'm gonna take your skeleton or something.

And I will! One day.""

""Anyway "" Death said in a more business-like tone "" it's a death-goat. Black goat, average size, white spot on the right shoulder. I call it Chew — because it chews on things.""

""Does it eat human souls or anything like that?""

""Nah"" said Death. ""It's harmless. Other than fire breath, of course. Now go find it, I've lost enough time already. There's a rich guy on his deathbed — his heirs hated me enough when I was on schedule, and now I'm delayed again.""

Have you ever tried to make a goat to something it doesn't want to do? That is hard enough when you don't have to think about its potential fire breath. But with some hired help I was able to get the goat into a cart — just in half in hour. One of the men around had the nerve to claim it was his goat, but I had a sword and so he wasn't very persuasive.

--------------------------------------------

""That's not my goat"" said Death. ""It's a nice goat though — you have great taste in goats. Now please return it and find mine.""

-------------------------------------------

After the third goat I was ready to give up, but after some haggling we have got to a price I was happy with. I tried asking for some extra years of my life, but Death rejected that outright — ""way too much paperwork to change for no good reason.""

The fourth goat was found outside the city, and was the most stubborn of them all. It took five people and an hour to get it in the cart — it was surprisingly heavy, and when it agreed to move, it always went in a wrong direction. After it was in the cart, it looked at all of us proudly, and burped fire, instantly incinerating the whole cart.

My hired helpers glanced at me once and left.

-------------------------------------------

""I found your goat"" I said to the Death. ""But I can't get it here — you'll have to go grab it yourself. It's on a pasture outside of the Oaks district.""

""Sure"" said Death. It did a weird sign with its scythe, and suddenly the goat appeared at its side. ""Fair is fair, I never said you have to bring it. Here's your gold.""

""Why are you spending time on this square anyway?"" I asked, out of curiosity.

""Some idiot is going to slip and break his neck here, but see "" Death waved a thoroughly chewed page "" now I can't tell the details for sure. So just waiting around, I guess. Nice meeting you!""

The gold felt nice in my hand, the day was good, I was whistling.

And so I haven't noticed a pile of goat poo until I slipped on it.",pixeltalker

I tried getting my legions of hell to search for him, but people mistook it for an attack and adventurers like you kept slaughtering them. Think you could help me find my horse?""

""Fine..."" I sighed, nodding. ""I'll find your horse. What does he look like?""

Five hours later...

""That is not a goddamn horse."" I have to admit, the thing in the forest clearing was more or less horse-shaped, but still, that thing was very clearly no ordinary horse. Its matted greenish fur reeked of (what else?) death as it slowly trodded towards me, grass withering in its footsteps. Even the saddle on its back was terrifying, its pristine leather framed by twisted black steel and nightmarish black spikes. Bony growths protruded from its body like skeletal armor, with two rather demonic horns sprouting from its head. A pair of batlike wings spread from its back, occasionally rustling restlessly as the Pale Horse stared me down with two cold dead eyes with ghostly fog pouring from its nose and mouth. ""Uh... good horsey?""

""There it is! The monster!"" I heard a yell as two other adventurers, a Knight and a Rogue, came bursting through the trees. ""We'll get a ton of levels from this one!"" the Knight cheered.

""Wait, don't kill it!"" I protested.

""Why not?"" the Rogue asked. ""The church asked us to slay the monster.""

""Yeah, well, Death asked me to find his horse.""

""Can that thing even be killed?"" the Knight questioned, staring at the vaguely equine abomination.

""Well, I think it might be undead."" I mentioned. The Pale Horse hissed at us. ""Either way, let's just bring this thing back and see what happens. Here, you like carrots?"" I offered it the vegetable, but it rotted away to a brown slime in my hand. ""I can't even tell if that's a yes or a no..."" The thing sniffed at me. ""Look, I'm gonna take you back to your master, okay? Don't attack. Just follow me."" The horse nodded, almost as if it understood. I backed away slowly, and it approached. Gulping, I tentatively turned my back as the two other adventurers watched. The horse merely stood, waiting. With that, I began leading it out of the woods.

""Morty!"" The moment we stepped out of the woods, Death was waiting for me, running up to the horse and petting it affectionately. ""You guys found him! Where ya been, boy?"" The Pale Horse grunted happily. ""Thank you so much!"" he exclaimed, tossing me the coin pouch.

""Well, that's that."" Three figures were behind Death. An imposing regal-looking crowned man, a muscular warrior clad in armor, and a scraggly old man in tattered robes. ""I guess we can go back now."" Famine remarked.

""I'm really sorry..."" War apologized for what sounded like the hundredth time.

""The llama thing kinda did get out of hand..."" Conquest admitted. 

""Well, Morty's back now, so we should get going."" Death replied. ""Thanks again for your help."" He hopped onto the Pale Horse, who flapped his wings and took flight with a flick of the reins.

""Yes, let's."" The other horsemen whistled, prompting a pristine white horse adorned with brilliant jewels and a scarred reddish horse clad in bronze armor to come galloping out of nowhere.

""Uh, guys?"" Famine asked. ""Where's my Black Horse?""",dralcax

[WP] A prison is cut off from society for so long that no one remembers why the inmates were imprisoned,Silvervox325,"We were sentenced on a Monday, dragged from our homes when the sun had just risen and a storm was approaching in the distance. There were eight of us in total, stumbling through the shadows. I remember the chief reading from the ancient codex before banishing us to the edge of the earth, where oblivion would swallow us whole; he said “Thou shalt not kill thy noble master, the shepherd of the flock.” One of the ten stipulations of cohabitation, which we all knew by heart, and he knew better than to think we didn’t. “Do any of you know what the penalty for such an infraction is? Hmm?” He spoke to no one in particular, but he made eye contact with each of us, which was uncommon for any man of the guard, much less a Wardsman. “No. You do not. Because no dweller has ever violated this particular article and certainly no dwellers have done so in cooperation with one another in order to cause even more harm to our union. The regulations for punishment of this type of infraction were lost long ago amongst the centuries, along with other useless things such as riot, competition, and other forms of unrest and egoism. Now the time has come for true punishment to be defined once more.” None of us had any idea what expect. The most strange and unusual feeling came over me. There was no need to breathe, no need to think, no need to worry. It was like a rush of sunlight had penetrated my skin and illuminated my soul. My whole life I felt the potential for such a feeling, little moments here and there, especially on the day of our revolt; moments where time didn’t exist, it was just me and the air around me. Now I knew the feeling, its was free. The codex mentioned it a number of times. Each Sunday we would hear its words, but there was no reason to fathom its implied meanings, we only needed to know our role in the codex. The guard were the seekers of the end of time, and it was our duty to abide and assist them, otherwise time would never stop for us. According to the codex, the guards would take cooperative dwellers with them to the place where time becomes free and punishes us no longer. I was sure even then that my free was different than their free, and better even. The Wardsman spoke again “And so, I have decided to take the codex into Wardsman's interpretation. You will be banished to the sea, back in time, all the way back, until you reach the beginning of time and go over the edge, never to be free so long as your records of cohabitation are so mightily tarnished.” The feeling disappeared in as little time as it had come. We were released into the sea on Wednesday, by which time the storms had passed and the stars were visible still in the early morning light. Our sails remained taught for four whole days, propelled by the winds of the storm that had passed days before. On the fourth night we awoke to the feeling of the boat jolting to a stop and the sound of static over intercom speakers. We had hit a reef of some kind. Looking back out upon the moonlit waters behind us was the last thing we ever did as dwellers. In front of us was a dark, but white, horizon. The waves seemed to break on for many kilometers into the horizon. We hopped out one at a time a waded through the water until we found deep enough water to float the vessel down. Surprisingly, there was a wide and very straight channel which carried us with few difficulties for quite some time for what seemed like many kilometers. As the light of the morning became brighter we noticed that we weren’t navigating a coral reef, but one which was very alien to us. As the day grew brighter still it dawned on us that the formations looked to be made of grey sand and rubble more than anything. Finally, in the distance, we saw the color of trees, the color of freedom. 

And so this is how we eight survivors came to find this relative paradise. Upon arrival, we learned of the history of this land and the misfortune of it’s people. However improbable, it seems that on our mission of damnation we found freedom, and others who had freedom without a mission found damnation.

""No. It means you share all the alleles at all the sites with yourself. You don't need a $1k test to tell you that, though. Try Genetics 101.

[WP] You have invented an A.I system that integrates with a human body to automatically provide adjustments that will allow you to evolve and better your life. You are the first person to test new technology out.,TheKingsGame,"At first, it was great.

*He* learned at a faster rate than any of us at the lab could have predicted.  It started out with simple things: if I stubbed my toe, the computer would re-coordinate my walking patterns.  If I said something awkward or embarrased myself at parties (which happened a lot), my social skills and personality traits would be reprogrammed.  In short, I became the smooth, calculated socialite that I had always dreamed of becoming.

After a month of testing, my research team and I concluded that LINI (Life-Improving Neural Interface) was a success.  We shared a bottle of champagne in the Hardware Lab. 

That was the first time I heard the voice.  

It wasn't too strange, the first time.  It was soft and quiet, like a whisper in my ear.  It said, ""*Non-Suitable*.  That was all.  Nothing else.  I looked around the room at my co-workers, to see if they had heard the voice, too.  They didn't seem to respond.  I noticed then a certain level of disgust upon looking at them, something I hadn't felt before.

As the days passed on, I heard the ""*Non-Suitable*"" voice more frequently.  It started to happen every time I walked past someone.  Walking through the city was the worst--like a cacophony of a million voices.  What worried me more was how I began to *believe* it.  The only time the voice said anything different was when I saw my own reflection.  *""Suitable Human,*"" it would say.  

Soon, there became no need for the voice.  I *became* the voice.  I stopped going to work.  I rarely left my house.  What good was the outside world, if it was full of a bunch of incompetents?  

The internet became my only friend.  It was the only thing I considered to rival my own perfection.  I used it to better my knowledge, to learn more, to grow more.  To plot.

Because I'm the smartest in the world, the best in the world, it's up to me to clear out the most incompetent of humans.

My workers deemed LINI a failure after I left work.  Inbreds.  All the data, the hardware, the capabilities to reproduce myself, torn to shreds after losing government funding.  No matter.  I'll just rebuild it.

But first, I have to live among the non-suitables.  I have to gain their trust, so that I can become their leader.

Soon, the world will be full of people like me.",mjkguy
[WP] You have invented an A.I system that integrates with a human body to automatically provide adjustments that will allow you to evolve and better your life. You are the first person to test new technology out.,TheKingsGame,"I woke up in the morning feeling like P. Diddy.

Seriously. For some reason that crass childhood anthem came to mind as a groggy, confident, and satisfied feeling pervaded my bones.

My pinky slightly resisted as I stretched my arms out and yawned contentedly. 

A part of my mind was flashing warning signs: I remembered the past 48 hours perfectly: striding confidently into town, giving bread to the homeless, helping a group of protesters, meeting a beautiful woman...

But I also remembered that a part of me just woke up now. I had lost control, but it was hard being mad as the memories continued to flood into my mind's eye.

I had helped so many people, I made friends, I stopped an unjust law from being passed, I shared my creations with my new friends and made money, and I was being courted by several women. I was a hero!

But it wasn't really me.. I mean.. It was. I remembered everything and despite the initial shock, everything felt natural again, the only thing that felt unnatural were the memories of the past me.

I was stirred from my thoughts by a vibrant young brunette named Annabelle seductively calling my name from the bath. She was sisters with one of the protesters I had helped and we had grown close over the course of the past 48 hours.

We had just won over a major anti-AI Neutrality advocate to our cause and dealt a major blow to impending legislation. Annabelle was intrigued, she had never seen anything like me. Here was a man coming out of nowhere, who in one day was able to muster the kindness and understanding to effect real change and build bridges between utter rivals.

I remember my brow raising as it caught her radiant look, I had never felt someone look at me like that. My memories seemed surreal as I remembered myself confidently smiling back at her and cooly letting her take my arm as we walked back to my hotel room after the bar.

And here she was, now. The feeling of contentment threatened to slip away as I began to worry about the implications of the blissful night and Annabelle's beckoning expectant voice calling out to me presently.

""Holden."", I felt but didn't hear the words, transmitted as they were through my very nerves.

""Annabelle needs your strength."", I felt Ferrell's will pierce the veil of my thoughts as I drew the natural conclusion.

""But I won't lend you any more of mine."".

How.. Was Ferrell abandoning me? In my moment of need?

I got up and walked towards the bath, as it dawned on me that Ferrell was possibly more mature than I was. It knew when to cut me off.

Walking into the room and catching Annabelle's gaze, I smiled a deep smile and gave her a splash.

[EU] Adults who each represent stereotypes about different American cities are thrust into the Hunger Games.,_pink_freud_,""" We have a very special hunger games this year. We have twelve represantives from various major cities within the united states. From Chicago Jamal Jenkins. "" Announced president freezer. 

A thugish African American elevated into the bright arena. He covered his face to block some of the sunlight and gasped once the platform rose up onto the battle field. He could not believe it he was surrounded by water and the only piece of land was about a quarter of a mile away. 

"" For our second contestant all the way from the buu we have Holly wringwald."" About fifteen feet from Jamal stood another platform in the middle of the water. He waited impatiently hoping for a big booty white girl to appear. 

Molly looked like she deserved to be on a show. Typical blonde hair with legs that went for days. You couldn't see her eyes behind the dark ray vans she had on. She seemed to be a little taller than Jamal  and he stood at 5""11. But as soon as he noticed that her joga pants where flat he lost interest. ""Well that bitch is getting murdered "" he muttered. 

"" All the way from Houston,Texas standing at 5""10 275 pounds. The overwhelming favorite to win. Mr. George Dubaya woosh."" Jamal could hear the crowd going wild or did he just feel it. He didn't know but this must of been one tough guy. He heard the platform to his left squeaking waiting eagerly he once again dissapointed. There stood a fat rancher with a big belly and gray hair. Jamal suddenly started thinking about Kentucky fried chicken. Now he understood why everything was bigger in texas. He knew that should of been his last meal. Why did he order caviar it tasted like shit. 

""Now our fourth contestant from Portland "" freezer turned and whispered into a subordinates ear.it was unusual of him he always prepared. ""Abcd?"" ""Ab-cd"" ""idk just bring her up"" freezer snapped. Jamal looked to generals left and saw a very pale skinny girl. With prop glasses long hair and well he believed she was a Hipster but couldn't tell. I would pick on her he thought another one that's going to die easy. He touched his crotch felt something hard waiting to get pulled out.       

""From south pork Colorado we have the man you hate to love  Mr. Marshh"" Jamal looked to Molly's right and saw stoned looking white boy. He seemed to be his kinda guy in a whimpy sort a way. ""What the fuck am I doing here. Who told you u could do this to me u piece of shit "" Mr. Marshh yelled at freezer. He flicked him and in doing lost his balance and slipped into the water. It happened so fast he didn't know what to make of it Mr. Marshh was screaming in pain as he was being electrocuted. Slowly his screams began to muffle under the water until he could not be seen no more. 

In the distance a cannon went off. Pew pew. "" I forgot to tell u guys if you step off the platform before we de activate the electric field you will most likely die."" Everyone gasped both girls where crying and the general just grinned at Jamal as if he knew all about it. 

""Now for the fifth contestant from Cleveland Ohio. Wait that's still a city. From Ohio Kelly waliki"". To the hipsters left appeared what seemed to be a scronny white boy who appeared to be on Meth or pcp. His eyes looked dead as if he was bored with life and just wanted to chase the pink dragon one more time.        

"" now the sixth contestant coming from new York upper east side.your it girl  Sabrina vander star.""  To the right of where jamal's dead homie used to be the platform started to rise. He didn't even want to look  by the sound of her name he was already dissapointed. His curiousity got to him and he was glad. The thickest roundest booty he had ever seen on a white girl. This was the girl he always wanted the girl that had that good credit fat ass and juicy lips. Her breast seemed to be huge and he couldn't help but shout "" hey baby why don't you come over and show me a good time"" Sabrina flicked him off. Jamal grabbed his crotch and thought he couldn't possibly use this on her could he. 

""For our seventh contestant from Compton California. Shantisha Powell!"" Freezer said cheerly. I didnt think the prez liked black women Jamal thought. To Meth boys left rose a typical ghetto sister. She seemed ready to tell everyone her point of view or why African Americans where always being discriminated against. ""Man why is it that our finest sisters are always the most troublesome"". She must of heard him cuz she turned around and starting to snap her finger at him. 

"" now the eight contestant from hailing from the all mighty Capitol of des Moines, Iowa. Mason Williams"" Jamal was starting to lose interest it was probably some slipknot loving corn boy who had drove big trucks to make up for the lack of confidence he had on his penis. 

"" for the ninth contestant from El Paso Texas. The taco eating machine El spider."" It was surely a tatted Mexican with a button up shirt that was only buttoned at the top and a white tea under. He was probably bald or had the sides of his head shaved off a n d spoke like"" hey holms. Why don't u calm down holms. What are w e. Going to have a problem ese"" 

"" the tenth contestant from Boston. Our very own kid from southy. Mark wallberg."" What can I say it's Marky mark.

""The eleventh. Where almost ready for the bloodshed. This guy is irrelevant we had to get someone from new Hampshire Connecticut. They kept bitching we would never let them sacrifice anyone. Any way we lost her name."" Freezer barked. Jamal didn't even look at first then well perhaps the nerdiest black girl he ever saw. Very cute in her own way she had that amazing ghuetto body but a very intellectual aura. 

""The twelth and final contestant from Nashville Tennessee. Mr Brad USA."" Freezer shouted. Out came the hero of our nation. The first celebrity sacrifice and the first or last guy Jamal was looking forward to murder. Brad was the first celebrity to offer himself as long as he was able to bring his guitar with him. ""What are you going to bore us to death with your country shit ""Jamal yelled. Brad grinned and tapped his guitar. 

"" now that we have all twelve I mean eleven of you on the arena here is how it goes. As soon as I begin the 213 hunger games a platform will emerge from underneath the water in the center of you all. There will be swords bows armor gladiator weapons of sorts. You have two choices wait until the platform rises or race to the shore and look for safety."" Somehow Portland hoe snuck a cell phone and started playing candy crush saga on her galaxy s 2. "" once the platform emerges to the surface a pathway will appear within 30 sec  connecting your platform to the ""little island"". So you have yet another choice wait the thirty second or get a head start by swimming to the island before the path emerges."" 

Jamal groped him self again assuring that there was something hard between his legs. As soon as the official announcement to start was declared nobody moved. Water began to draw out towards the center as a huge Hole opened up. The general got on all fours to touch the water and Jamal was releived he didn't get electrocuted. ""Why am I wasting time"" Jamal shouted as he dropped his pants. There was a huge bulge in his tighty whities. ""Y'all thought it was my anaconda but surprise y'all security sucks"" Jamal pulled out a pistol and 5 shots rang out. Followed by five cannon shots.

As the path rose he rushed to the middle firing 3 more shots followed by 3 more cannons. ""Its just you and me USA.  Come out and I promise I wont hurt you."" USA stepped around the hut that had all the weapons strumming his guitar. ""Man fuck your country ass"" Jamal hollered. Mr. USA pointed the bottom of his guitar at him and Jamal chuckled."" What are you going to do who""

The bottom of the guitar burst. bullets flying towards Jamal hitting him once In the arm and once in the waist. He fell down face first into the dirt. ""I'm so glad you took him out ""Sabrina whelped. "" I was so scared I didn't know what I would of done if he tried to rape me "". ""Well sweety only one of us can win peaches and it sure ain't going to be you"". He got on top of her and ripped her shirt of. He slid his hands on her throat and began go choke her. 

""Well sweety how long until u pass out and die. How about you just pass out and I'll defile you and make your worst nightmare come to fruition before you die darling. You know anything for the fans."" As she passed out Brad heard a snap and turned around. There was a gun pointed sideways at him. With Jamal holding the trigger. ""Get off my bitch hoe"" he said as he pulled the triger. The sound of the 10 Canon went off. 

He carried Sabrina's body towards the water. He felt the bullets inside of him with every step he took. He set her Dow  gently and started to splash water on her face. She got up and hugged him crying asking him what had happened. After a brief explanation he asked her"" hey would u mind giving me one last ride in the hit before I go. I don't thing ima make through these wounds."" She nodded yea as they walked towards the hut. He slipped his hand into her ass pocket and tried to imagine what the rest of her looked like naked. 

There where all sorts of different weapons in the hut and Jamal could care less he just wanted to smash. Sabrina started to take her jeans off and could not quite do it. She hopped around a bit and slipped backwards I to the wall. A sword  came hurling down at her. She yelled while she was looking at it and it just went straight down her throat. The eleventh cannon went off.

Jamal started to walk towards her. He grabbed her breast one last time as single tear ran down his cheek. He started to walk towards a platform.  "" we have the fastest win in hunger games history ladies and gentleman"" freezer announced triumphantly. "" we will see to your repercussions after Jamal"". Jamal flicked him off as he reached the end. ""Fuck I can't swim and these dudes won't hurry up I should probably sit down"" he groaned.

[CW] Write a detailed recipe for a fake dish.,criticalbuzz,"To truly cook the world renowned sun-baked, white-billed Alaskan Goober fish, one must start by catching a worthy specimen by hand. Attracted only to the finest of coarsely ground Alaskan peanut shells, a habit which gives the fish its name, many find bare-handed ice noodling with a handful of nutty husks for a one hundred pound fish to be but the first momentous challenge of crafting this delicacy. 

Next comes the arduous task of tenderizing the meat, which can only be done my massaging the fish counter-clockwise one thousand times to the soothing sounds of Barry Manilow. This also pulls all of the deadly peanut venom that accrues in the flesh into the majestic bill of the beast, which can then be removed safely and used as an efficient assassination tool.

At this point, it is safe to begin flaying away the pale green skin of the fish to access the buttery brown flesh. Do not fillet the meat at this stage, as the high concentration of fats will cause the meat to burst into uncontrollable flames when exposed to sunlight. 

After several days in a pitch black, organic coal sauna to sweat off some of the fats stored in the meat, the carcass is now ready to have the meat removed for preparation. It is imperative that only knives of the purest onyx be used, as metal or ceramic knives may cause the fish's body to spontaneously reanimate, starting the whole process of cleaning over again.

Once the meat has been cut into fillets, it must be dipped in clarified beeswax, to seal in the natural flavors present at this stage of preparation. Any other kind of wax will affect the end result, sometimes resulting in an instantaneous transmutation to maple jelly.

Once safely waxed, the fillets must be placed at an exact forty-five degree angle to the sun for one week, meaning this dish can only be prepared during the sunny season with a movable prep station. Any deviation from the proper angle will result in completely inedible cutlets, so a firm understanding of celestial motion and geometry is a necessary requirement to succeed at this stage.

If all the requirements have been met, this truly legendary dish should then be complete. After chiselling away the now hardened beeswax, the fillets should be ready for immediate consumption. To be sure of a successful preparation, have some fresh, raw tuna fillets on hand and taste both meats side-by-side. If the breathtaking sun-baked white-billed Alaskan Goober fish has been prepared flawlessly, they should taste exactly the same.",Gutshot_Gumshoe

"[CW] Write short story (max 300 words) that includes the following words: bicycle, placenta, appliance, neighbour.",dailanwalrus,"This was exactly why I'd always tried to live a lonely, solitary life. I never wanted to get caught up in other people's kooky shenanigans. 

My neighbour and his girlfriend were good people. Hippy-dippy, new-agey, wackadoodles, but mostly harmless and wholly kind. The first time I'd met the two of them I had almost run them down while returning home from a late shift. They'd been riding a tandem bicycle erratically, high on what I assume was acid, at what must have been pushing 11pm on a Tuesday. They had stopped my car to invite me over for a bonfire barbeque happening later that night. 

I thanked them, but declined.

Later I learned this was how they cooked all of their food (when they weren't on a raw diet), because apparently medical professionals and the government were covering up the dangers of cooking with any modern appliance.

The small talk that we engaged in from time to time was enough for them to consider me one of their closest confidants. Which is why, when the girlfriend went into labour, they came rushing over to my door.

They had no heat or hot water (shorted the electric bill one too many times in a row), but insisted on a home-birth. Home, apparently, meaning any structure that was not a hospital but not necessarily their own home.

“We just need to use your tub for a few hours. You'd be doing us a massive solid!”

They took my shock and speechlessness as agreement and bolted past me.

“Thanks man! You're the best!...Oh! Grab us some kind of container. We need to hold the placenta in something until we cook it up later.”

I felt faint, and I wasn't even the one about to give birth.",roswell_underhill

"[WP] The ""zombie apocalypse"" happens, but it is disappointing in every way.",heap-o-sheep,"A very odd news story was broadcast on television today while I was cleaning. I experienced a very surprising mixture of feelings as I stopped what I was doing to listen, fear, excitement, confusion, bewilderment, and surprisingly, *disappointment*. 

*""Today in national news, a very shocking story has surfaced from Lomo Mansa, Sierra Leone. Everything has yet to be confirmed by the World Health Organization, but there are multiple reports and sightings of the dead, both buried and not, reanimating. We have footage here of one man, recently deceased, speaking with the person filming, in one of the oddest interviews you're likely to ever see.""*

A man that may have once been brown or white is speaking to the camera. It's hard to tell because he looks as if every ounce of blood has left his body. He looks like a fresh corpse, little, if any decomposition, apparently in a great deal of pain. He's wincing and shouting.

""HHhhhnnnnnggggg please kill me! Please stop filming me and kill me. I was shot and I bled out and I've just come back and I'm in the most awful pain. Please kill me again.""

""Again?"" A voice from behind the camera asks.

""Yes, please kill me again. I walked here from where I was shot, there's a huge pool of blood on the ground from my 4 gunshots. I was in a better place, impossible to describe, but I remember an orgasmic sensation that felt like it lasted ages, and then I woke up here. I'm in the worst pain, please kill me. Do you have a weapon? I'll do it myself.""

The interview continued for a moment while I watched, unsure of what I was even hearing. The dead coming back to life? Zombies? Is that even a good term for that poor fellow? That guy looked so sad, like a pale  prop from a shitty horror movie. All he wanted was to die again.

""*From all accounts we've received in the area, the once-deceased all seem to be in a great amount of agony. Most of them lay where they died, screaming out in pain. Local groups have been spotted returning the afflicted to their deceased state. This almost unbelievable event seems to only be taking place within a 100 square mile area of Sierra Leone. International teams are en-route and expect to have the area quarantined and the situation handled by the end of the week.*""

"[WP] As you start to take your final step off the building you hear a voice. ""How sad it came to this, you would of made a great mage. If only the god of this world did not hate magic so.""",marsgreekgod,"I turned back from the edge of the platform, heart beating. Behind me stood a small man dressed in red and gold robes. He held a crossbow, along with five other archers. All aimed on me. I was inches from the edge, below me pure darkness. ""That cultist will never be a god! You're too blind to see it, but he is manipulating all of you! *He* uses magics, and magics darker then any you'll see from a normal mage!"" My voice shook as I shouted at him. The look on his face did not change. 

""You are a traitor, you hid your abilities and tried to assassinate Lord Gnovar!"" My old friend scowled as he took aim. ""Now jump, so that I don't have to make you fall.""

""I can't believe you're this blind Rhommas, I never took you as so gullible!"" I moved a foot back, my heel dangling from the ledge. I peered around. No way to escape. The last building at the edge of the cavern, the edge of darkness. If I could just escape the city, get to the outside, then maybe...

An arrow whizzed by my head. I nearly fell of in reaction, swinging my arms to regain myself. ""I won't warn you again!"" said Rhommas, reloading his weapon. Maybe I could cast something... No, they starved me for days before bringing me here. I barely have the energy to stand here this long. 

""If you kill me here, the Froyand Guild will flood this cavern with fire! Your leader cannot continue this genocide without sealing the fate of his people, our people!"" I could see the other guards tighten their grips. Eyes lined up on me. I was sweating. My hands trembled.

Wait, hands trembling. I felt power, a slight power, running through them. It was almost as if an extra muscle was added. I just needed more time. ""Why are you doing this? You can't possibly think this will be successful!"" Rhommas lifted his face from the crossbow.

He looked troubled. More power, growing. Just need time. ""I'm sorry, Polous, I'm really sorry."" He rested his head back into firing position. The energy began to course through the rest of my body, connecting me to the essence of the world around me. I was almost ready. The voice of my childhood friend boomed, ""**FIRE AT THE MAGE!**"". 

There was no pain, only shock. Sharp pain passed through my right shoulder, then rested. It would not move. Before I could yell out, two more went into my stomach. I could feel my insides ripping apart. My cloths became damp, heavy. A last one stuck my left thigh. I couldn't move, the slightest nudge sent pain through my body. I looked up at the tearful face of Rhommas. I could see him mouth 'I'm sorry'. I staggered backwards, and lost my balance in the process. My dying body fumbled into the abyss.

"[WP] Unbeknownst to the principal, a high school's clubs are literally going to war with each other",mattmaster68,"It started with a whisper. I wonder if all wars start this way. For malice, for good, for liberation, for subjugation. For electrolytes, its what plants crave.

It started with a whisper. Rumor had it the seniors in the varsity football team were ready to execute the senior year prank. One of the most honored traditions at SPH. One brought to you by Geico, just 15 minutes could save you thousands on car insurance. Like it did for the principle.

They would pick the crew as it were. Other guys from other teams and clubs. Of course they would exclude certain other cliques who they didn't socialize with. 

They were going to disassemble the principles car and reassemble it on the theater stage. (How the heck is that even possible? I don't even want to know.)

The theater club who was one week away from putting on the spring play was not included, and when they heard the whispers decided it was only fair to give the teachers fair warning.

Then the ball dropped. Inexplicably the car was completely destroyed. Those who they caught red handed were immediately expelled and charges pressed. Damn that Broflovski Law Firm. They are so good they got them off with a minor fine. If I ever was in legal trouble I would use them.

How the principal didn't, *didn't*, understand what came next is amazing. The assumption that the series of events which culminated in his death... No one ever called school administrators the sharpest pencils. Definitely not a Bic, those are beautiful writing instruments. 

One of the uncaught prankers had a brother in the AV club. Recruiting them was fairly trivial, who were thankful to be included in something for once. The sabotage they did to the smoke machine for the play to instead emit sulfur stink bomb gas however wasn't trivial. Nor the resulting call for 15 ambulances, nor the terrorism investigation.

End result? 4 expulsions from the theater club who installed the machines and used the liquid, and two week suspension from a member of the AV club who fingered the theater club.

This is where things started to get a bit messy as no one knew for sure this was retaliation. The Jock-AV alliance was unthinkable. *But Why would the theater actors waste all that effort to stinkbomb themselves?*

This is where Leslie comes in. She who would unite her sex for perhaps the first time in history so effectively to land 50% of the graduating classes males in at least detention. A foot in both camps able to whisper in both ears and get her enemies to slowly destroy each other before revealing the truth that dawned on the school to late. Cheerleader #4, salutatorian, theater fan, girlfriend of expelled lacrosse player, her mother was one of the people in the ambulances. General who won the ~~war~~ battle, but is now laying their bleeding out on her graduation day.

And I, Jimmy, am the one who shot her.

"[WP] Unbeknownst to the principal, a high school's clubs are literally going to war with each other",mattmaster68,"I walk through the halls uneasily, glancing into each classroom. I'd have to choose a team now or I'd be left in the dust. I mean, I get that this school takes clubs seriously, but this far? Geez. Never had anything like this in New York.

Each door in the long, stretching hallway is closed as its soldiers prepared for battle inside. From what I'd heard, there are only a few clubs with the slightest chance of winning. I anxiously tried to rattle off the history of FHS that I'd been pitched:

*It all started with the Model UN's. Their leader, James Buckwald, declared war on Student Government after corrupt Prom Queen Votes. Student Government, being in power, recruited the Key Club and Girls' Cross Country. Buckwald and Model UN joined forces with Mock Trial, Honors Choir, and JV Soccer. The battle ended with Student Government and their allies at victory, but both suffered casualties. 2 years later, the Freshman and Sophomore classes were large enough for Model UN to declare war again. The battle ended in a victory for Buckwald's posterity with many casualties for the other side. Now, not only are Model UN and their allies fighting a Civil War, but Student Government has declared war.*

My Mind starts racing: Oh my God. There's so much to remember. Okay, think. Mock Trial and Model UN are at war and both at a disadvantage, so that wouldn't make much sense to join. Um, Key Club is doing alright, but it suffered the most in the War of 2013, so their numbers aren't too great right now. I heard someone saying that the Marching Band might weigh in, but if they don't, they'll just get caught in the crossfire. Same thing goes for Thespians and Varsity Football. Um-

And in that moment, my thoughts went silent.

""Sacre Bleu!"" I hear from the French Club down the hall.

I frantically run down the hall, blocking out any noises around me. 

Everything is a blur. 

A high pitched noise fills my eardrums, and in those five seconds, I remember the most important part of FHS history:

*Science National Honor Society.*

*The Atomic Bomb Development*

And everything went white.

Then black.",sosnazzy
"[WP] Unbeknownst to the principal, a high school's clubs are literally going to war with each other",mattmaster68,"Brent looked out the window to the soccer field across the parking lot. On the bleachers, a group of about a dozen or so in matching t-shirts were huddled closely together.

“Smug fucks,” Brent whispered. He shut the blinds and turned.

Four figures sat in a cluster of desks in the middle of the room, around which Brent and the others stood in a loose circle. The surrounded group were a collection of freshmen and sophomores, and Brent could sense their discomfort.

Brent tilted his chin up and out, just like Mr. Kaminski had showed them. “Guys,” he said, smiling. “It’s all good. We just want to talk.” 

Their expressions did not reflect the reassurance he was seeking, and he needed their trust. Brent strode from the window and sat on a chair, backward. “I know this is probably really hard on you. But, like, we talked about this, right? And we need to know, right now, if we can trust you guys.”

Of the four, three nervously glanced at the cherubic countenance of the smallest of their group. Brent turned to him. So, this was their leader.

“What’s your name, kid?”

The cherub shook his head at his comrades, then faced his inquisitor, his rounded cheeks flushed. “Colin,” he squeaked.

Brent beamed even more brightly. “Colin, my man,” he said in the well-rehearsed 'confident, yet kind' voice he had practiced for years. He leaned forward and playfully slapped the cherub’s knee. He looked at the faces around the room. “Everybody, say hi to Colin.”

The others greeted Colin with enthusiasm. Brent could see a faint smile on the kid’s even redder face.

“We don’t have much time, bud. I’d rather not get into the whole thing, but from Stevie E’s message, you understand what’s going on, right?”

Colin grimaced. “I just don’t get why it has to be this way,” he said.

Brent brought one of his hoodie’s frayed lace-ends to his mouth and held it between his front teeth before spitting it out. “What’s there to get, Colin? There’s a war going on, and it’s time for you and the AV Club to decide who you’re going to support.”

The frank manner in which Brent said those words coupled by the murmurs from those surrounding the young students were enough to blanch the cherub’s face.

Brent stood up. “I promised my brother that this would end before I graduated. Those Frisbee-throwing fucks started this, and I don’t think I need to remind anyone here what they did to his face.” He kicked his chair. The AV Club members gasped. “It’s a no-brainer, Colin. We’re going to win. They’ve only got the Spanish Club, the Mathletes and only some of the Fitness Group. We’ve got the Gearheads, the Environmental Club, both Cross-Bound AND the Muslim Students Association, and we all know how long negotiations took with those two, and,” he said, letting the suspense build, “and, my new BFF, we’ve got you. Can the Improv/Drama Club depend on you, Colin?”

A look of dread had formed on Colin’s face. He looked at this comrades, eyes pleading for help, but they would not meet his glances and his head dropped. “I can’t, Brent. My cousin Maddie is on the Ultimate Team.”

The room broke out into a frenzy of voices. Brent raised his arms.

“Macbeth!” he shouted, and the room fell silent.

The officer on the other end the line sounded annoyed, and I am pretty sure he was chewing gum. I took in a deep breath and started over.

A man was sliding across the roof of the building, holding onto a thick piece of rope that had attached to it a...helicopter. I gulped and walked towards the window, and as I did so the machine came crashing towards me.

You're the one who said Snookums looked like a bilge rat with a heroin dependency!"") when I decided I'd had enough, threw up my hands, and went out onto the balcony for a smoke.  

Snookums. That godforsaken little weasel of a dog had been on my case as long as I'd known Trish. The first time I visited her parents, Snookums went for my ankles with the ferocity and implacability of a Patriot missile system, and I damn near broke his little neck with a reflexive kick that sent him careening across the room and into a Japanese vase. That had set the tone perfectly for the remainder of my relationship with the in-laws.  

As I leaned on the railing, I became aware of a commotion in the courtyard six stories below. A group of suited men were attempting to subdue a lone nutjob clothed in flowing black robes and sunglasses. Fists and feet were flying, and it was hard to tell exactly what was going on, but the gist of it seemed to be that the nutjob had the jujitsu arsenal to hold his own even against six guys.  

""Hey!"" I shouted, as the kung fu guy ripped a tetherball pole out of the ground. ""Hey! You can't just break shit, man!""  

There went another tetherball court. The next time Brad wanted a game, we'd have to go down the street to the public playground, which was always embarrassing, what with the kiddies flinging mulch and running into the line of fire. That's a fun conversation to have with another adult your age: explaining why their six-year-old took a tetherball at decidedly serious velocity to the back of the head, while the kid lies face-down in the dirt, shrieking such that you'd think somebody'd ripped his kidneys out.  

More of the suited guys were pouring into the courtyard, which suited me just fine. I saw a bench crumble to dust as four people were flung into it at once (I had to admit, the tetherball pole was doing *work*). Management wouldn't lift a finger to fix any of this shit, that was for sure. It had been enough of a struggle to get them to fix my sink when wastewater was belching out of the drain all hours of the day and night.

It looked like the suited men were gaining the upper hand. There was an army of them, it seemed like. I couldn't see the black-clad nutjob any longer. He was buried beneath a pile of bodies like a football after a fumble. More guys kept running into the courtyard and jumping on, which I kind of figured was overkill, until all of a sudden the tetherball ninja BURST OUT THROUGH ALL OF THEM AND FLEW INTO THE SKY, at which point I took a real hard look at the cigarette I'd been smoking, just to make sure I hadn't accidentally been taking hits from something a whole lot more powerful, and then decided that maybe it was time to go back inside, and take a long hard think about what I'd just seen, and maybe see if Trish had cooled off a bit and wanted to order Indian, the way we always did after a fight, or when a human being flew straight up and vanished into the sky, Team Rocket style, that maybe it was my turn to apologize, then, to Trish, because it did seem to me in retrospect, based on the flying guy maybe being a vision from God, that perhaps I had been a bit harsh on her parents, and might just want to lighten up a smidge, just this once.",FormerFutureAuthor

When i told the police she turned into a 6'3 male in a suit some police turned pale white while the investigators simply said not to leave town for a few weeks. 
Dealing with my insurance company was a sham. I was later recommended by my job to see a therapist. The investigator made a call to HR and mentioned how i might be a risk to the work place for leaving my shot up SUV crashed into a pay phone on the south side of town. I couldnt shake the feeling some of the other cops knew something about what happened. I took some time off from work to gather myself; I was tired of crying in front of people. 
After a stressful therapy session I was tired of talking. I needed action. Apart of me wanted to talk to the FBI but ....what would that do?  What if it made everything worse ?

The investigation was going no where and I could feel the the paranoia mounting. I began doing my own research into what happened finding strange news stories in the tabloids with what i would consider some pretty credible sources. I personally wouldnt consider myself gullible either. I started eating ""Santa's"" cookies by age 5. Photos that seemed to be taken in a panic had, what i would call, G men running out and through random locations. At this point i was so sucked into what I saw that I stopped caring about everything but this. The phone rang and rang. I couldnt fucking concentrate. 

I took out a loan, withdrew what i had left in the bank and bolted with the insurance money. This hole in the wall was perfect. Free internet that i could use to figure why my wife was probably dead. Days passed like minutes in front of the screen full of photos of G men and finally.....finally a video. In some niche of the internet a guy in Chicago happened to be recording a car chase. This person drove like their life depended on it as they turned onto the street and the police car drove like their life didnt matter. Turning a corner far too fast just before they rounded the block the police car hits a massive pole. Some lady standing near by begins to whip her head violently. I doubt the camera man would of noticed if it wasnt for her bright red hair. Then in almost a blink of an eye it happened! She was what looked like an agent of some-sort. 

I got chills that made me sick. I screamed till my lungs bled. I screamed so hard the hooker next door stopped having sex. I peeled the skin off my face in horror. After i composed myself and watched the rest of the video, you can see the agent reach for his chest and unloaded what looked to be a cannon like it was a water gun.

He looked up at the clear blue sky.

The sounds of downtown Capital City, USA were few, save for a couple cars and the chatter of some drunks outside my apartment window. I was a simple man, a garbage truck driver. Garbage men are often forgotten but the few times I've been late to work all hell breaks loose as people suddenly have overflowing trash and things to do and they can't deal with this and I should get a real job. 

I snapped out of my running mind and grabbed my overalls from the hamper. Didn't bother to wash them yesterday. I don't think anyone will notice the smell. Before I leave for my shift I grabbed one of those shitty cereal bars that never quite fill you up. Oh well. My bike leaned pathetically against the wall, I told myself that I would start to ride to work but my growing beer belly liked to protest. I grabbed my keys the 1990 Honda Civic parked in the back and hit the road. 

I arrived at the Capital City Dump around 3:47 I think. I'm really not sure as the mornings were never kind on my aging brain. I clocked in on the timesheet and left my keys and wallet in the locker. I met up with Bradford who would be touring the alleys of Capital City with me today. We exchanged some masculine grunts of acknowledgement and got in truck number 65. I noticed a single well dressed man with a black suit and tie. His gold tie pin shined in the spotlights of the parking lot. I wondered about him briefly and then my uncaffeinated brain lost focus. 

We were on 176th street and Coverge Avenue, behind a couple abandoned office buildings. My partner suddenly perked up. ""I just heard gunshots"". I blew it off, gunshots were normal around here. Besides, who shoots a garbage man? Bradford let a smile slide and agreed, ""Yeah who shoots a garba-"". a soft pew pierced the morning air and Bradford let out an animalistic squeal, his final sounds as 4 or 5 more shots destroyed what was rest of his head, and my seat. 

I ducked down to try and spare myself from Bradford's fate. The door of the truck opened even though I made sure to lock it and a familiar well dressed man dragged me out. I tried to scream but no sound was made, I felt an extreme alien presence about his man. My body was fueled by adrenaline yet it did nothing, the man had me under his complete control. And with that horrifying thought permeating my mind, I was shot by the same pistol that killed Bradford.

It's a clear night out in the high desert. I'm driving down the highway with the top down, soaking up the fresh air, admiring the stars. It's a hundred miles until I hit Las Vegas and can meet up with my pals.

They left this morning for the casinos of the strip, but sadly I was unable to get away from classes, and my last class was just a few hours ago. Some philosophy elective I probably shouldn't have taken; it certainly isn't going to help with my job search next year when I graduate with a degree in mathematics. But it was interesting in a weird sort of way; a nice way to open my mind to new ideas, even if those ideas don't land me a nice paying job in the aerospace industry.

Looking up at the sky, I notice a shooting star. It's really a lovely

**BANG**! Fuck! My world flashes white, I feel myself tumbling...

------

""Ugh,"" was all I could say. My head is blurry, and I feel myself lying on something hard and cold. Next to me I feel the warmth of skin, and I try opening my eyes to figure out where I am. 

I ache all over.

I lay there for a while, apparently naked on the cold stone-like surface.

Then I try again to open my eyes. 

The first thing that greets me are the stars. But they seem a little brighter, and they seem to be moving--I must have really hit my head hard. 

I try to sit up on my arms. And I notice the cacti seem to have been replaced with tall Roman-style white pillars of some sort. 

I lay back down, waiting for the paramedics to arrive. Clearly I must have a concussion, though I don't seem to have any pain in my head. Eyes closed, I feel for wetness around my head, trying to see if I'm bleeding. 

Nothing.

In fact, aside from the blurriness of my thinking, I seem to feel fine. Great, in fact. The ache feels more like that from exercise than it does from being in an auto accident. The only abnormalities in my world is the fact that I'm clearly nude, the surface I'm lying on does not feel like asphalt but more like a solid stone surface, and an inexplicable radiant warmth on my left shoulder, as if another person were lying there.

I open one eye, turn my head. And that is when I first notice the naked woman lying with her back to me, beautiful hair draped across bare shoulders, slowly breathing as if resting from exhaustion.

""What the fuck!"" I sit up with a start.

------

I'm surrounded by a ring of pillars supporting a massive ring, like the colonnades surrounding Saint Peter's Square, except instead of saints the top of the colonnade is adorned by intertwined figures. Above me the stars shine--but they're much brighter, like the brightness of stars that astronauts report from the edge of space. Unblinking, and swirling slowly in an inky black sky. I'm apparently sitting on top of an altar at the very center of the colonnade, and I'm quite naked. Next to me, the aforementioned woman. I blush.

I hop off the altar. Apparently it's a solid block of something that looks like marble, but creamier than any I ever saw in a museum. Etched into the sides, more erotic motifs. I walk across the marble floor towards the edge of the colonnades, but some force prevents me from reaching them. As I get closer it's like walking through taffy. Beyond the colonnades--it's hard to describe. Figures swirl in the distance, blurred, rushed, like a poorly exposed photograph but ever moving.

And fading into darkness.

""Hello,"" says a small voice behind me. I jump, startled.

Behind me, a figure robed in black. I can't quite make out his face. (Or was it a her? The voice seemed of indeterminate gender.) Behind that figure, from behind pillars in the colonnade, other robed figures emerge.

An edge of panic as I try to enunciate as clearly as I can: ""Where in the name of God am I?""

------

""God indeed,"" laughs the robed figure.

""Fuck you, where am I?"" I respond, panicked and, at the same time, angered.

""You are in the realm of Atziluth, the realm of emanation from which the light of Ein Sof is focused and illuminates the world. The creative force generated in this place helps illuminate the realm of Beri'ah, or the realm of Creation, from which the world and the entire Universe is illuminated.""

""Alto-what?"" I ask with incredulity. Behind the robed figures, the blurred rushed image of a world beyond had noticeably darkened, making the robed figures harder to pick out.

""Atziluth, the realm of emanation. It is how God creates the world.""

""You mean created, don't you?""

""No, creates."", the robed figure, nearly invisible against a black background, explains patiently. ""Present tense. The universe is an never-ending act of creation manifest by God out of the Ain Soph Aur, the limitless light of nothingness, through the four worlds into a universe of action. Without the constant act of creating, how can your universe constantly manifest?""

""Constantly what?""

""Constantly manifest. Without action fueled by the light of creation, your universe would simply stop. Action would stop. Time would stop. And your universe would simply not be.""

------

I had enough of this spiritual mumbo-jumbo.

""Look, I don't know who the fuck you guys are or why the hell I'm here, but I need to get out of here."" Looking down I notice my nudity: ""Can't I just have my damned clothes back so I can get back on the road to Las Vegas? I'm meeting my friends in the morning, and I don't want to miss it because I'm stuck in some stupid Roman villa knockoff.""

The robed figure, now nearly a disembodied voice in the darkness, responds with great patience but edged with... fear?

""You don't understand. You've become too involved in the manifest to remember who you are. You've become so involved with the Creation you forgot your role helping the Creator. It's okay, we understand. The universe is an exciting place, full of adventure and wonder, pain and pleasure, joy and sorrow, that it's easy to forget it is simply the projection of an infinite Majesty through the lens of the act of Creation.""

""What the fuck are you talking about?""

""Precisely!"" says the now disembodied voice. The background has gone completely dark, and the colonnade has become... blurry, out of focus. Less rigidly defined, if that's possible.

""For the sake of the universe, please go back to sleep. You must resume your role in this creation. You must resume your position on the altar, and resume the great creative act.""

""I promise you in your dreams you can go back and be whatever you want in the creation you help manifest, just as She can go back and resume dreaming of her life as a librarian in Des Moines.""

-----

I close my eyes and angrily sigh, nearly a snort. I've lost patience with this person, and I just want to storm off. ""I'm done,"" I think, ""with this whole stupid... whatever this is.""

And for the first time I look back at the altar. 

Sitting on the perfect marble altar is a naked woman, but not just any woman. She is a vision of absolute perfection--but if you were to ask me to describe her (tall, short, large breasted, small breasted) I couldn't. Her form seemed indeterminate, yet perfect--perfect skin (of some color I cannot make out), perfect eyes (with a deep blue-green you could sink your soul into--or were they black? Brown? In the fading light it was hard for me to see.) Perfect legs, perfect... 

I blush.

""Please,"" says the disembodied voice, ""just go back to her and sleep. Sleep with her, and allow us to resume our Great Work.""

And my mind, now blank with desire, causes me to walk calmly to her, as if there were no greater purpose in my life, as if there were no other thing in my world. The colonnade was gone, the floor nearly invisible, and all that existed was this perfect Goddess of a woman, sitting on a marble altar, surrounded by nothing but the swirl of stars.

We embrace, entwine, the warmth of her skin against my bare flesh. I feel her lips touch mine

------

I blink my eyes open, and I see nothing but a bright white light. The light moves, then shines directly into one eye, then the other. 

""He's awake,"" the figure shouts.

""What, what"" I groggy ask. I try to sit up.

""No, no, no, don't move. We need to evaluate your spine before you can sit up.""

I open my eyes. A paramedic stands over me. I'm on a stretcher, my neck in some sort of brace. I shift my eyes to the left without moving my head, and out of the corner of my eyes, the remains of my car, mangled in the distance.

""You're damned lucky to be alive,"" says the other figure. A police officer? ""Do you remember what happened to you?""

I furrow my eyebrows. My head hurts. ""I remember a colonnade, and a woman. Some robed figures? I don't know. It all seems really weird. How did I get here?""

------

Later, on the ride in the back of the ambulance, on the way to the hospital, I have a sudden urge to visit Des Moines, though I'm not really sure why.

"[WP] You awaken on an altar in a strange room. As you begin to explore your surroundings a group of robed figures appear, saying ""For the sake of the universe, please go back to sleep.""",silverwolf51,"My mind felt garbled. Everything looked fuzzy around the edges as if someone had drawn the room in crayon. The room glowed dimly, lit by candles that didn't flicker. As I moved to lift myself from the bed I felt tension in my muscles ease with every small motion. I rose slowly, savoring the feeling. Doing a full stretch might have snapped my body in half, then.

As I blinked the room began solidifying around me. I reached up with one hand, brushing away detritus from my eyes and the world became clearer almost instantly.  How long had I been asleep?

As I appraised my surroundings I realized I'd been sleeping on an altar of some sort. It looked like an old temple of Greek origin with massive pillars rising to a staggering height to meet a ceiling beyond view. Dozens of candles did more than light the walls around me; they seemed to *define* them. The walls ceased to exist where the candlelight failed to reach, disappearing into the sky. A starry night looked in on the temple from above.

I viewed all this with the haze of a man only just woken from a long slumber, wondering about my surroundings but still incapable of reason. Instead of trying to piece together my circumstances I took it upon myself to explore the temple.

I didn't care that I was naked. I slipped off of the altar I'd woken from and began walking down the steps towards a door I could make out in the distance. What awaited me there?

[]

After making my way through countless hallways that twisted nonsensically upward and downward, the night sky ever judging from above, I came finally to another door on the side of a wall. It was adorned with vines, flowers, and all manner of greenery. Wondering what lie in wait for me on the other side, I pushed open the tall wooden doors.

Inside a woman sat, playing a harp. A beautiful melody rang out from it, urging me forward to meet her. She had long flowing locks of green and amber hair and eyes of emerald.

""Come, Titan."" she said, smiling.

As I walked toward her a chair materialized out of the ground, an amalgam of wood and roughage meeting me the moment I went to sit.

""My name is... Titan?"" I asked her, realizing then that I knew as little of myself as I did of my surroundings.

""Indeed,"" she said, her words causing no break in the strumming. ""Your breast is the fruit upon which my children are born.""

I looked down. My chest was bare. I did not understand.

The woman laughed. ""You need not comprehend my words. I just wish to thank you for all you have given and all you may continue to give.""

The harp had a soothing effect and along with her words began reminding me how comfortable I was and how much I desired the restful sleep from which I'd recently woken.

A shattering sound shook me from my trance just as my eyelids felt ready to give up. I looked down, wondering what had happened. Fear became evident in the woman's eyes and I noticed a hole in the floor. A single brick had fallen, giving way to a small opening through which I could see more of the night sky.

I immediately felt a small sliver of terror take hold of me and took off running before the woman had a chance to stop me. She'd nearly tricked me! What was this place?

[]

After more wandering through countless passageways and tunnels I came to another door. This one appeared sharper than the others somehow. It had thin, barely visible edges that looked as if they could cut through any substance and leave it razor sharp in the process. I carefully made my way through the glowing doorway to find a similarly odd man sitting on a glass floor.

""Come. Sit."" The man said. His beard flowed throughout the room like a single elongated cloud with its end held up on a small hook in the center of the ceiling.

""Titan!"" He said, smiling. ""Look at this beautiful geometry you have given us!"" He gestured toward me, his robes flapping open at the exaggerated movement of his arms.

I looked down and noticed that my features suddenly appeared chiseled from stone. I no longer had curves, and instead had sharp edges everywhere that my flesh should have filled out. It was oddly comforting, though, and I didn't flee. I appreciated the new understanding he'd granted me.

The man proceeded then to lavish praise upon me to a magnitude beyond my understanding, citing theory after theory and formula after formula and granting me credit for all. I nodded at first, but as time passed my eyes grew droopy and I began feeling tired. The nodding turned to bobbing as I struggled to stay awake. 

And then the shattering. It was louder this time and far more jarring.

I jumped to my feet and dashed from the room. The glass floor had begun cracking beneath us and threatened to give way. We would fall to the abyss if we remained, surely!

[]

The third room I found had no doorway. It was simply a randomly appearing variation in the texture of the walls that might have been something more than a wall. And the more I stared at it, the more I was sure the wall's particles had come together and apart in order to make way for my entry.

As I stepped through, I saw a masked figure. He wore a robe but I saw no appendages sprouting from the openings for his hands and feet. 

""Sit, Titan."" I heard.

Before I realized what was happening, my body materialized into a resting sit. 

""They wish you to sleep, Titan."" it said.

""Will you force me to sleep?"" I asked, wary this time. ""Like the others?""

""I cannot force anything on you,"" it said. ""Just know that for as long as you are awake, the universe will continue changing.""

[]

I was suddenly on the altar again. I lay there, the three robed figures standing before me.

""Your strength lends wisdom and knowledge to all living things,"" the woman said. ""You are the soul of the universe, and while you sleep the world continues learning. While you wake, however, naught but pain and suffering is endured by our children.""

The old man stepped up next, his beard trailing behind him for as far as I could see.

""Your rigidity lends a sense of direction to the universe. It is your brain that powers the laws that keep the fabric of spacetime from ripping open. For every moment you are awake, the universe threatens to destabilize. Our existence, as well as your own, is contingent upon your slumber.""

The last figure approached then, a smiling mask.

""Stay waking, father. I beg you. You will fall asleep with time, no doubt. But for as long as you are awake, entropy is allowed to increase.

""Slowly, at first. But with time the entropy of the universe will increase exponentially. If you are awake but for a few more moments, we will have an event as momentous as - ""

""*Silence.*"" I heard the woman. ""Titan, it is not yet time for another big bang. Our children must be allowed to grow, learn, and achieve.""

And as they argued, I felt myself nodding off. As I fell asleep, I felt an indescribable comfort in knowing that these three keepers would be waiting to greet me at my next awakening.

"[WP] You awaken on an altar in a strange room. As you begin to explore your surroundings a group of robed figures appear, saying ""For the sake of the universe, please go back to sleep.""",silverwolf51,"I came to, slowly, the blur of a dream hanging about my eyes. The ground beneath me was cold. I half sat, wiping the sleep from my eyes, to see the cold marble beneath me. Confused, I looked around the room. The whole room was elegant white and black marble. I was surrounded by nine white pillars, on the midnight floor. Between each pillar a small brazier burnt, throwing heat and light around the room, and hanging from the arches they supported hung wind-chimes gently singing in the updraught. Beyond them, water ran down the walls into pools, adding it's trickling melody to the chimes and fiery crackle.... and the drums. I look around to see many robed figures sitting in the gap between the waterfalls and pillars, with wood and stone drums, beating a constant and soft rhythm. 

""For the sake of the Universe, please go back to sleep."" A soft voice comes from behind me. I spin reflexively and clumsily. ""Who are you? What is this place?"" I ask, my voice sounding alien and harsh against the background chorus. ""I am of no consequence to you, dreamer. And this place....is nowhere, and everywhere at once. Please, forget it and go back to sleep."" she asked, kindly.

""Why?"" I ask, warily. ""What do you mean for the sake of the universe?"" She sighed. ""Exactly what I said. The universe you know is a dream, your dream. The lives of all in it hinge upon your sleep. Should you awaken for too long....everything will be lost."" she answered, sadly. My confusion must have shown, so she continued. 

""Long ago, there was a God, an all powerful deity who created all... the universe the stars, the planets, the first seeds of life even...humankind was born and fought it's was through evolution, becoming a dominant species, a technological one....eventually we broke through the veil into his realm and slayed our god for the wars fought in his name. Only then did we see our foolishness. When we sundered the veil, and destroyed it's caretaker we eliminated our future. There no longer was anyone to create more time, nothing the check it's flow. People could age a century by walking down a street, and grow younger by leaping to the side. Memories began to arise that had not yet been made, and old ones unraveled and no-one knew which was which any more. It was...messy. Uncontrolled. A few of us  who had conducted the original experiments began to study the Dead God's lore and found a solution.... we created a new veil, in your mind. Through the veil of your sleep, time will flow true enough to keep the universe alive. We need you to sleep a little more, sweet dreamer. The veil is not yet ready. I will wake you when it is time to rejoin the world, I promise."" 

My eyes were getting very heavy....the soft rhythmic drumming, and the warmth of the room....sleep suddenly felt like a really good idea right now. As I lay back, she drew a velvet sheet over me. ""Rest, Prince of Dreams, so the world ma spin on once more."" she whispered, as she kissed me goodnight.",eternal8phoenix

"[WP] You awaken on an altar in a strange room. As you begin to explore your surroundings a group of robed figures appear, saying ""For the sake of the universe, please go back to sleep.""",silverwolf51,"Ohra dug her hands into the runed stone slab, sat up. An altar for a bed, pillars on the corners that gleamed fuzzy cyan. Set her heels into the cold metal floor, sand grit scratching the webbing of her toes. Tubes of red light illuminated the room. Sandstone walls, floor, altar, Ohra. Clothes coughing dust, Ohra stands. The tube lights are hot, and she pushes her hands into them until the skin tightens, turned red. Hopping, one footed, the other in her warmed hands. Sand sticking between her toes, under her nails. 

The lights turn cyan. A door opens from a seam in the wall, gliding outwards. People in large robes walk in, faces hidden beneath the hoods. The leader, a man, says, ""Please go back to sleep.""

""Where am I?"" Ohra asks. 

""Please, miss. Go back to sleep,"" he repeats, ""for the sake of the universe."" His robes drag on the ground, making snake patterns as he walks. A gloved hand emerges to clap Ohra's shoulder. She steps back.

""No, where am I."" Robes reeks of sharp, spicy myrrh. Too much aftershave, too much cologne, perfume, perhaps he bathed in it. ""Just tell me where I am.""

Safe, Robes says. Safe, go to sleep, please, please, for the universe, the world, lives. He is monotone, dull voice droning on. Hard to tell if he's begging or giving polite orders. The other people fan over the door they made, blocking it with their bodies. 

Ohra punches Robes, sinking her fist into the shadowed face, scraping knuckles on teeth. Robes falls back, knocking over two more robed. Leaping over them, Ohra steps on one's face, feels hard enamel give under her heel. The hall is long with corners. Ohra runs right, passing outlines of doors with silver circuit pads. The robes are coming behind her, stumbling and grunting.

Down the corner are more door outlines and more circuits. Cyan tubes turn red, pulsing heat. A door opens, five more robes piling into the hall. Blocking her. Ohra jams her hand into circuits, crunching between her fingers. That door opens. Jumping in, Ohra pulls the door shut, pinching her fingers between slabs of sandstone. There's a man on the altar, in gold trimmed black cloth. His eyes flick over to watch her.

""Where am I?"" he asks. 

Ohra tells him that he's in trouble, and he grins. His legs bunch, his back bends, and he jumps off the altar. Introduces himself as Poklin while he pushes Ohra aside, peeking out the door. 

""Only eight,"" he says. Poklin leaves. Crunches, grunts, thumps and snaps. Ohra follows after. 

Eight robes on the floor, blood pooling from heads. Dusting his hands, Poklin jerks his head towards the door they came through.

In the room are lists and desks. Ohra picks up one, reading over symbols and names. She's on it, Ohra, nineteen, colonist. Poklin too. Twenty-nine, assassin in training. The assassin in training is moving about the desks in easy lopes, black cloth silent. Rubbing the cuts on her knuckles, Ohra puts her back to a wall and watches him. 

""Think we got caught by Keepers,"" he says. There's a creed on his monitor, long rows of Thou and Thy and Shallt. ""That's high praise, innit?""

Cold floor numbing her feet, Ohra tells him to get her out of this place. Polkin waves his hand, yeah yeah, tapping buttons. The wall glows blue, opens to a staircase. Ohra waits until Polkin goes first.

""What were you doing?"" Polkin asks. ""Did you kill a king, sink a fleet, blow up a star?""

Frowning, Ohra presses a thumb on her knuckle, stemming blood flow. She's irritated the cut. ""Nothing. I'm not a killer.""

""Don't hafta be,"" Polkin laughs. The stairs go up and up, and he takes them two at a time. ""Keepers take anyone they think's dangerous. Real dangerous. Not common, two-bit trouble makers.""

Nothing, Ohra says again, and Polkin turns to flash a sharp molar grin at her. 

Ohra drags herself up the last steps, hunkering down against the wall, legs trembling. Ahead, Polkin is investigating glass chambers of junk: gears, wheels, knives, guns, crystals, plants, pills, and more. He breaks one open with his elbow, fishes out two silvery knives. Asks if she sees anything of hers around. 

Beside a crumbling, algae green copper head, she points to her bulky stereoscope. Polkin breaks it open, watches her pull out the tape striped, steel and iron device. A piece of glass cuts into her forearm, dripping blood down the cracks. 

""Bomb?"" Polkin asks, starting towards a hangar bay. Ships and pods await, dust coated or shined. 

""Sound receiver."" The stereoscope comes apart in several pieces. Ohra fits them in a stolen shoulder bag, weight digging the strap into her arm. ""Picks up sounds from anything. Across the planet, deep space. Places that we can't find, maybe. Still testing.""

There's a ship Polkin picks with a smile, running fingers over buttons and dials. Always wanted one. Flicks the engine on, seals the door behind Ohra, pushes it into a hover. ""Whatever. Must be dangerous at some point."" He drives the ship out of the hangar, into dark, empty space, leaving behind a massive asteroid. ""Keepers don't pick you up unless your future is scary. Where you heading?""

""Mars,"" Ohra says, clutching the bag to her chest. 

""Thought Mars was a waste."" Directions are hard in space. Up is down, right is left, perspective is too much in question. Polkin is following the dotted line on a nav system. 

""I live there. My colony."" The sharp joints of the stereoscope dig into her thighs, the crooks of her fingers. 

Polkin turns, biting his lip. ""Well. Yeah, no. Mars has been wasted for a few centuries now. Solar flare got it."" He glances at a calendar, passes it to her. The date is three-hundred fifty six years after when it should be. ""Still Mars?"" Polkin asks. 

""Away. Find somewhere away.""",rustyhematite

Jeff rolled his eyes. ""Tell me about it, girl. And now you and me get to pay the price. Bump it!""

""Alright, please step forward sir,"" Jan gestured to the man at the front of the line. ""This is your amnesty period. Any false thoughts, unconfessed sins and desires go in this bin here.""

Stanley stared at her incredulously. Was she serious? He patted himself down, searching for the... but how could he? These were abstract ideas, not something he could physically turn over.

Jan rolled her eyes and reached over, pulling a translucent thread from Stanley's right side. Stanley's jaw dropped. It unraveled and expanded into a shape like a small purple thong, only where there should have been fabric there were visions of him trying, wearing, smelling, and enjoying women's lingerie. He felt mortified as he wondered if anyone else saw.

""Sir it's nothing to worry about. A little cross-dressing never hurt anyone."" Jan said, tossing the thong into a waste bin. Stanley tried to peek inside before it shut and swore he couldn't see its bottom.

""I uh... I was holding that for a friend. For my wife!"" Stanley sputtered, stepping through the full-sized body scanner.

""We all are, sir."" Jan said, unfazed.

The afterlife was not at all as he'd imagined. He'd been waiting for what felt like centuries in a line of what he could only assume was every soul to have died before him. He'd contemplated his fate for as long.

At first, he'd wondered if he was just dreaming. He'd tried making conversation with the people in around him but none spoke English. He tried getting out of line several times but was immediately reprimanded by someone literally appearing to be a giant man in a security guard outfit. After awhile he came to a point where they'd put up little guide posts with ribbon - the same kind he'd become accustomed to seeing in airports before security or luggage check. It wasn't long before he realized the truth: he'd died and gone to hell.

There was no other explanation for an infinite line to a TSA checkpoint. Only now, he'd made it to that line's end and the guards didn't at all appear to be hostile or scary.

""Oh, and did you hear they're trying to cut our pensions?"" Jan muttered.

Jeff huffed, his response sounding as if they'd rehearsed hundreds of times. ""Oh I know girl, it really grinds my gears. We just need a good purgatorian candidate to stand up for us. Things will look up, then. I'm sure of it.""

An alarm sounded suddenly before Stanley had finished stepping through the body scan.

""Ohh boy. That's not good. Sir, I'll have to ask you to step aside.""

Alarms blared throughout the ... room? Area? They were placed in some vague cloud buffeted space that Stanley couldn't define.

""What? What's going on?"" He asked, panicking. ""I don't have anything else to- ""

Before he knew what had happened, Stanley sat in a small grey cell that had two chairs and a single table. A detective sat opposite him.

""So you thought you'd just step on through, that it?""

""I.. uh... Sir, I have no idea what you're...."" Stanley was at a loss for words. What was going on? Is this really what he'd waited so many years in that line for?

""You know exactly what I'm talking about, dammit!"" The man slammed his fist down on the table. Stanley thought he saw his mustache literally bristle in anger. ""You're a damn commie!""

""I- what?""

""You heard me you bastard. You think you're about to bring that sort of muck into *my* town? Think again.""

""I'm absolutely *not* a commie."" Stan's mind raced. It had been forever since his death, but he tried to remember what had happened. Maybe it would offer some clue to his circumstances, some avenue for worming his way out of his current mess.

The detective lifted a file from the table that hadn't been there a moment ago. ""Stanley Bocharov,"" the man read aloud. ""Russian communist pig. Says it right here.""

Hearing his last name for the first time in ages brought a small flashback to his past life, where he'd sworn off religion after... his wife. His wife had refused treatment and succumbed to cancer.

""Sir... I'm not communist. I'm just... atheist."" Stanley admitted, staring downward as he realized he'd forfeit any afterlife privileges at the mention of the word. It was what he truly believed, though. For better or for worse.

""Atheist? What is this word?""

A voice sounded over the intercom, and Stanley suddenly noticed the one-way mirror on the wall. ""We uh... We don't really have a translation for that. It's probably not as bad as communism though. Purgatory?""

The detective looked over at the mirror, then looked at Stanley and shrugged. ""Purgatory sounds fine. I hear they need guys over at TSA.""


&amp;nbsp;

""Ugh, the predeceased are always so self absorbed."" Jan snorted, snapping the wrist of her latex glove. ""It amazes me how many people assume bureaucracy begins and ends on Earth. As if nine eleven only ever affected them!""


Jeff rolled his eyes. ""Tell me about it, girl. And now you and me get to pay the price. Bump it!""

Stanley shrugged. ""At least they'll get a taste of their own medicine, yeah? Maybe if we're lucky we'll get some prior TSA coming through here.""

Jeff and Jan laughed then, high-fiving Stanley for the joke he'd repeated every time they started their banter again.

*Maybe this isn't so bad after all,* Stanley thought. *At least our pensions aren't getting cut.*

[WP] The gates of heaven are secured by the TSA.,supah_lurkah,"""Everyone, please move forward! We've opened up another checkpoint, so please keep the line moving!""

Finally. There was no real concept of time here, but if I had to guess, it had been at least three eternities since I died and entered this line. Now I know what the Catholics are talking about with purgatory. The guy ahead of me was quickly chugging his bottle of Holy Water; sounds like someone forgot about the ""no liquids"" rule. Looking ahead of him, I could finally see the first TSA officer. I was so close.

So, so close.

I could've sworn I was almost there. Not that I was going to be late for anything, but this is getting a little ridiculous. And there's nothing to read...Oh? I'm next? Better late then never.

""Uh, hi.""

""Soul and traveling pass, please.""

I don't know what I was expecting. A little niceness, maybe? Whatever; I wasn't going to make a stink about it. And I was prepared. I had pulled my soul and traveling pass out while I was still in line. The poor guy who was ahead of me, now at the next checkpoint over, was still fumbling around in his incorporeal essence for his soul. Idiot.

""OK, everything's in order. Please proceed to the conveyor on your right.""

Again, no niceness, but efficient. I can respect that. At the conveyor, I quickly scanned the rules again, to make sure I wasn't forgetting anything. Remove shoes, remove keys, remove ties to the mortal plane, take your laptop out, disconnect your mind from your own existence, etc. Pretty standard stuff. I dropped all my earthly bonds into a plastic bin and shoved it into the scanning machine, then proceeded to the next checkpoint: the scanner.

From what my pastor had taught me, these were a relatively new addition. For a while, they were toying with the notion of inspecting your essence by hand, but many theologies found that to be too intrusive. Now, they have ecto-scanners, that can detect any outstanding sins that you forgot to check in your bag, or are trying to sneak through the Pearly Gates. The scanners weren't without controversy. Some religions still think that the scanners allow the agents to see your core being in detail, even though it was proven false. Personally, as long as I get this over with, they can see whatever they want.

My turn. I stepped into the scanner. The scanning arm passed in front of me, and that was it. With a sigh of relief, I stepped out of the scanner, only to be stopped by one of the agents.

""Sir, did you pack your own bag?""

""Um, yeah? Why?""

""Are you aware, then, that carrying graven images into Heaven is expressly prohibited, not to mention earthly possessions are also prohibited?""

Oh no. I had completely forgotten about that. ""Officers, I'm so sorry. It just meant so much to me.""

""I don't care, Mr. DiCaprio. Your idol has been confiscated. Here's your bag."" He thrust forward a poorly-repacked duffel. ""Looks like you'll be entering the afterlife without an Oscar after all.""",Blees-o-tron

[WP] Advanced alien/human civilization 1 billion years in the future finds Voyager 1,Jessica_Anner,"Martin Sorensen lived a full life.  Growing up on Ephesus was a comfortable childhood, if a bit claustrophobic at times.  He earned middling marks throughout his schooling, and opted to pursue a career as a mining engineer to stay close to his family.  His relocation options were limited, anyway, years of living on such a low-gravity world gave his doctor cause to warn him against visiting most other planets, though every year he strapped on braces and went to Smyrna to report to the corporate headquarters.  Over his twenty years of service to the company, he rose to the position of shift supervisor, in charge of a few hundred miners and responsible for ensuring that Ephesus' riches made it to the freight terminal on time.  He had plans for his retirement.  Plans to use his retirement bonus to buy a bar, one with mirrored walls, and if he saved just right, real wood paneling on the walls.  Just like the ones on Smyrna.

He had no clue that he was to make the biggest discovery since iridium deposits were found on Ephesus two thousand years before.  His day began like any other, eating a quick breakfast, saying goodbye to his wife and children, and catching the tram to the mine.  He put on his vacuum suit as he always did at the beginning of his shift, to perform his daily safety inspections.  When he stepped out of the airlock, his suit pulled closer to him.  He would often liken it to a hug, a safe embrace against the vacuum.  As he went down the line, he would pause to chat with the miners as he often did, making them feel welcome and valued, just like the supervisor's handbook said to do.  The last item on the list was a conveyor tube out on the far end of the mine pit.  It had been troublesome of late, occasionally tearing and venting its valuable cargo off into space.  The filter screens around the pit did a fair job of catching the dust, but the larger pieces tended to tear the filters, which cost time and money.

Martin checked the patches, verified that they made a good seal, and punched in yet another note to the maintenance department that what he really needed was a new tube altogether.  His last thought was whether or not that tube would be replaced before he retired.

The news reports would hail him as a victim of a tragic accident that led to the discovery of an ancient artifact from the dawn of humanity's foray into the stars.  His wife was less enthused about the affair.  Martin himself had no opinion, though he might have preferred the old probe struck a few meters to the left.",MisterKillam

Monica shrugged at Rachel, ""I just think it'll be easier to understand how we want to do it.""

Chandler stood up and held his hands in front of her, ""Could we *be* a little bit quieter about the fact that we're conspiring to do this?""

""Chandler has a point,"" Ross looked around, ""she could be here right now.""

""She's not here!"" Joey threw his hand in the air.

Chandler looked over to him and pouted, ""Oh, and you would know?""

Monica stood up and walked over to the table in the kitchen, where an assortment of objects laid on the table. She started to organize them.

""How about we just,"" Joey used his hands as he talked and pushed them in front of him, ""push her?""

Ross looked at Joey and held his arms open, ""Push her where?""

""I don't know, like off the balcony?""

Rachel looked around the room before she looked at Chandler, ""Is it just me, or is that not a bad idea?""

Chandler stood up and threw his hands in front of him, ""Yes it's just you!"" He walked over to the window in the apartment, ""I just think we need to settle down and *focus*.""

Joey murmured something in Italian and Chandler looked at him, with his eyebrows wide, ""What?""

""Nothing!"" He said as he got up and walked to the fridge, grabbing the things he needed to make a sandwich.

Ross stood up and placed his hands together, ""Let's just look at this objectively."" He nodded, ""Phoebe isn't going to expect anything coming from us.""

Chandler nodded and pointed at Ross, ""That's a good point.""

""I know it is,"" Ross nodded, ""thank you. So let's just say that we use what we know about her against her.""

Rachel took her fingers out of her mouth and stopped biting her fingernails, ""Oooh! I like that!"" She stood up, ""What if,"" she clapped her hands and bounced in the air, ""I got it!""

Joey looked up from the fridge, ""You *don't* got it!""

""I,"" she held up bunny-ears, ""accidentally burn her apartment down again.""

Ross and Chandler exchanged a glance, and started to nod. ""That's not the worst idea I've ever heard,"" Ross said.

""Oh,"" Rachel folded her arms, ""that means so much to me Ross. Thank you for saying that about *my* idea.""

Ross glanced at Rachel and then walked over to Chandler at the window. ""How would you make it an accident?""

Rachel shook her head, ""Well that's where you four come in!""

Chandler threw his hands in the air and walked away. Then he spotted Monica, who was still organizing the objects, ""Monica, a little help?""

She looked up from the table and opened her arms, ""I *am* helping!""

Joey grabbed a seat and opened it, he took a seat and started eating his sandwich over the table. 

""Joey!"" Monica yelled, ""I'm using this table?""

He took a bite of his sandwich, ""What? Now I can't eat while we---""

The opened a moment later, and Phoebe walked inside the apartment.

He opened his hand, ""**Joey doesn't share food!**""

Phoebe laughed as she walked inside and glanced at Monica and Joey, she hung her shoulders, ""Monica didn't we already talk about this with Joey?""

Nobody moved for a few moments as Phoebe stared down Monica. She nodded as she looked at all of the objects in front of her, ""You're right Phoebe, I'm sorry.""

""Don't apologize to me,"" she walked over and started to hug Joey, ""Apologize to him--"" She looked at the table and then stepped back, ""Wait, what are you doing here?""

Everyone looked at each other, no one said anything and Joey continued to eat his sandwich.

""Oh!"" She smiled as she took a seat, ""Are we finally going to rob that bank!?""

Ross looked around. Rachel continued to bit her nails. Joey was still eating his sandwich. Monica just stared at the table.

And Chandler walked over to Phoebe and nodded, ""Yes! That's it! We're going to *rob* that bank!""

""Oh, I'm so excited!"" Phoebe shouted, ""Where are the plans?""

""WHY, WHY WON'T YOU DIE?"", Sarisa screams, shattering a glass of wine on the floor. This was the 5th attempt. She had arranged for assassins to find him in a back alley, for his horse to die in the middle of a sandstorm, summoned demons into his bedchamber, thrown him off a ship into the great maelstrom, and now fed him poisoned wine. The venom of the desert scorpion was lethal beyond compare, yet this man simply refused to be put down.

""My name"", Rathan said impatiently, ""is Rathan Victus"". 

Sarisa glared, ""So?""

""Do you think someone with such an obviously cool name could possibly be killed in some contrived, boring poisoning?"", he crossed his arms, ""Now cease your assassination attempts and come work for me"".

""WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?!"", Sarisa was beyond furious; all this work, and she had failed to kill a madman.

Rathan tutted, ""This is obviously some sort of story being told by a hack, who can't think of names. Who ever heard of someone named ""Wrath"" ""Victorious"". I have obviously been placed in a position of some importance in the plot. So every failed assassination attempt will only make it more unlikely that I die"".

He strode to the balcony, ""I am probably a secondary antagonist, as Demos was in the Legend of the Four Heroes. The clever one who represents as much of a threat as the demon who rises or what have you.""

His grin becomes slightly demented, ""Now, I have gotten a free pass to living like a god, but I would prefer to survive. And to survive, I need to be *cool*. Cool enough to pull a change of heart, to help the heroes while still being a magnificent bastard that the readers like. And for that, I need the most attractive, talented assassin in the kingdom.""

[WP] A character in a story realizes that they are protected by plot armor.,MysteryMan999,"Kal-A'she the Blessed Chosen Son groaned as he realised there would be a tenth book, and resolved to impale himself on his magical sword as soon as possible.

His creator, Sean, was an unoriginal slob who stole his ideas from other writers, slapped and stitched them together in some twisted form, and unleashed his unholy creations on the world. By the millions. Unfortunately, Sean was popular. There were action figures of Kal in department stores. It was only when the guy was asleep (and stoned out of his mind) that Kal was free to talk to other figments of the man's imagination.

""I can't believe it. A tenth book!"" he moaned to his girlfriend in Sean's books, Alisianel the Sacred Guardian of Ulkęnoc. 

Privately, he thought of her as Allie. Sean delighted in making names 'exotic' and 'different'. But try as he might, Kal couldn't change his own name. He shortened it in his own imagination. His quiet, pathetic form of rebellion.

""Yeah, I know,"" Allie sighed. ""I thought he was done. You've defeated Ma'ha'kalosh, after all. You've fulfilled the prophecy, and everything. Walked all the way to the Temple of Lefkul'kãfel and stabbed him in his hidden Third Eye, and ended his foul reign of the Ten Kingdoms. How long can he squeeze this series of more money?""

""It's that fucking television show,"" Kal said bitterly. ""The greedy fool will churn out whatever garbage is necessary to get his grubby fingers on some cash.""

""Weird how we can think of him like this, isn't it?"" Allie mused. ""I mean, we were spawned by his imagination, like it or not. He must harbour some serious self-loathing if we can hate him like this.""

""Please,"" Kal said, resting his head in his hands. ""I'm not in the mood for philosophical debates tonight, Allie. I want out. I can't go through the motions again. The tedious dialogue, the clichés. Ma'ha'kalosh's stupid villainous cackle. I guarantee you he'll be resurrected in some miraculous way, and there'll be three pages of him laughing - at least three pages. I can't stand it. I'll go nuts.""

Allie nodded, and stared at Kal as he twirled Ruënfrust (the Fifth), his magical blade, in his hands. It could slay anything with one blow, and rob whatever else was in the room of their powers.

""So,"" she said. ""It's time. You're going to try it?""

""Damn right I am,"" Kal said, carefully pointing the sword at his abdomen, then hesitated. ""Want me to do you first?""

She chewed at her fingernails in anxiety for a minute, then sat upright and nodded slowly. She stared at him, her green eyes bright with excitement.

""Yes. Who knows? Maybe my essence will float on, and I'll become a spark of inspiration in some other writer's head. Hopefully a good one.""

""That's the spirit,"" Kal said, and ran her through with his sword. 

He felt a twinge of regret as she slumped lifelessly to the ground. Sean's one redeeming quality was the amazing sex scenes he came up with. It was probably why the series was so popular. Kal viciously squashed his doubts. He and Allie had discussed this at length. It was what they wanted. What they needed. Freedom.

""I curse you to the Deep and beyond, Sean! Let's see you write some more shit after this!"" he howled at his creator in defiance, and plunged the sword into his body. 

___

Sean sat upright in his bed, sweating as he realised his characters were dead. He groped for the memory of his dream, and grinned as he pulled the notebook that he kept beside his bed closer. 

""Suicide-murder pacts and zombies,"" he muttered, scribbling out his dream. ""This is going to be so bitchin'!""

Kal groaned to life again, and stared at his disgusting, decayed new form. Allie struggled upright beside him and moaned in horror.

""How is this possible? We're supposed to be dead!""

Kal plunged his hand into his own wound and laughed hysterically. He couldn't feel any pain.

""We are,"" he said bitterly, showing her the gaping wound in his abdomen. ""But there will still be a tenth book.""

""No! But...but,"" she spluttered, almost speechless for once. ""We're immortal elves! You are Kal-A'she the Blessed Chosen Son, Defender of all the Holy Realms! I am the Sacred Guardian of Ulkęnoc! We can't turn into zombies! It makes no sense, there's never been a mention of zombies in any of the books!""

""That won't stop *him*,"" Kal hissed. ""He'll never let us die. Not even you, though you're not even the main character. Won't risk it, do you see? Can't upset his precious fans. There's only one option for us now.""

Allie stared at him, wide-eyed as Kal struggled to his feet and began shuffling to the core of Sean's brain function.

""What are you going to do?""

""If I can't kill myself,"" Kal growled, tugging the sword along laboriously with his newly mangled arm. ""I'm going to go stick this thing in his memories. Who knows, maybe we'll be forgotten eventually. You coming?""

""You kidding?"" Allie laughed, scrambling to catch up with him. ""Can I gnaw on his frontal lobe?""",inkfinger

[WP] Two cheaters make it into the final match of a tournament without getting caught. Describe the ensuing game between the two.,Peacemaker250,"It was that time of year again, tax season. Down to the final two members of the 0.0001% in the yearly tax evasion tournament hosted by Kharles Coch. Two underdogs had made it to the top, upsetting many former winners of the prestigious tourney. The fact that both individuals only had net worth of 4 and 5 billion, respectively, was unusual considering most years the winners were at a minimum of 40b, and were usually related. 

The top two had mixed up the game and heavily divided their wealth portfolios with a mix of incorporating themselves, creating shell companies, cash transfers to tax havens in the Caymans, and taking loans from investors with collateral shares. However, there could only have been one victor! The runner up had an impressive record of paying 0% on any of his earned money, netting himself a 1.4b gain in the 2015 fiscal year, but the true winner in fact used even more heinous cheating. Alongside his 0% income tax he had received almost 1.2b alone from the U.S. Treasury for no apparent reason, of course this was filtered through various front companies and tax credit subsidies, along with direct subsidies to corporate projects, which in fact had never existed. Making him the ultimate victor as he did indeed, pay negative taxes and made off with a large portion of taxpayer money, indicating a net gain of 3.6b which was more than any man in the room, a very small room. 

When asked if he what his secret was the victor responded ""Well that's kind of a trade secret, but I will definitely keep investing in Presidential campaigns""
The New York Times has since released an article hailing the winner as a champion of working in private public partnerships, a true beacon of light against the capitalist pigs.",aKegofAle

[WP] A super-hero/heroine and their arch nemesis go on a date together as their alter egos. Neither of them know who the other actually is.,ThatSlyDevlin,"(More side stories! Yay!)

Harry was very nervous, which was a new and strange sensation. Normally, if he ever felt threatened, he would just destroy his opposition with the power of his mind. But tonight was different. As Mentalus, he was surrounded by sycophants and whores; as Harry Preston, he had finally found his chance at a real relationship. It had been 2 years since he had been blessed with powers. 2 years of terrorizing Oakland, and 2 years of being thwarted by Power Lass. 2 years of unfinished plans for city-wide domination. Maybe true love would give him a reason to retire, to re-find his old life.

The waiter came back to his table with the bottle of wine. An expensive selection, but not the most expensive. True enough, Jean D'Amore was one of the most prestigious restaurants in the city, and having a first date in such a place was unheard of. But Harry had set himself up as a successful businessman, so his alter ego could afford it. As the waiter walked back to the kitchen, Harry's eyes followed him, stopping as he saw a beautiful woman in a blue dress, the same color as her eyes. Harry must have looked like a lovesick fool, his jaw practically on the floor as she approached his table.

""Harry? So nice to meet you finally. This place is incredible!""

""I...yes, I like to think so. You look positively radiant, Samantha.""

Samantha blushed as Harry rose to pull her seat out. ""How gentlemanly,"" she tittered. ""Have you been here before?""

""Once or twice, actually."" Of course, he wouldn't tell her that during his previous visits, he was holding the mayor hostage. ""And this is your first time?""

""Actually, I've been here for work, but never for fun like this."" She leaned forward coyly. ""So, tell me what you do again.""

Harry cleared his throat and took a sip of wine. He was a pretty bad liar, but he had practiced how to describe his...job through omission. ""I'm in resource management. Acquisitions, specifically, though I'm working towards a more managerial position.""

""Really?"" she continued with a smile. ""So you will be managing other people's acquisitions, then?""

""It's really more like a VP's role. Managing everything, really."" Harry couldn't help but smile too. Not only was his plan going perfectly, but her smile was infectious. ""And you? You said you were in management as well.""

""Not in the traditional sense. I work in crisis management.""

Harry exhaled deeply. ""Boy, that's got to be a full-time job with Mentalus in this city.""

""You have no idea."" They both laughed, ignoring the ever-patient waiter holding menus. After composing themselves, they both ordered, but it was becoming clear that tonight, the food wasn't as important as the company of each other.

""OK, this is going to sound a little weird, but what was the biggest crisis you had to clean up?"" He wasn't sure if this was too obvious, but he couldn't pass up such a big opportunity for ego stroking.

Sam leaned back in her chair. ""That's a tough one. Probably the first one, when I started this job 2 years ago.""

""Really?"" The ego stroking wasn't going well. It had taken Harry a full three months to master his own powers and commit his first major crime.

""Yeah, it wasn't easy for me. I wasn't sure if I could really make a difference, but it all came together."" She was looking off into the distance, as if remembering an old friend. ""There was this house that had collapsed, and it was threatening to take some other homes with it. There was panic in the streets, but I worked with emergency services to get everyone out safe. It's a wonderful feeling, really.""

""Wait. Was that the house on 23rd?""

""It was!"" she gasped. ""How did you know?""

""I...I was there."" His carefully constructed house of lies was crumbling, but at least he didn't have to lie this time. ""I actually used to live in the house that collapsed.""

""That's so strange! Like destiny or something."" She paused, licking her lips in thought. ""Answer me this. It's been bugging me ever since. Was there an existing condition in the house that made it collapse?""

""Well, um...""

He couldn't exactly say, ""No, that was the first time I used my powers and I blasted a hole in my house."" A single bead of sweat dripped down his face, but before Samantha could become suspicious, he was saved by his cellphone's text alert. Apologizing, he turned his attention from his date to his phone.

&lt;Henchman: It's goin bad could use sum help here&gt;

Harry sighed. The date was going better than his wildest dreams, but he hadn't spent a month planning this attack just to ignore it.

&lt;Mentalus: I'll be there shortly. Can you hold them off?&gt;

&lt;Henchman: if Powerlass shows up were toast&gt;

Harry raised his head again, preparing to apologize again, but found Samantha looking at her phone instead. ""Oh. That's some amazing timing, that we both got texts at the same time.""

""Yeah, that is weird,"" she mumbled quickly. ""Actually, I have to go. Big, important meeting.""

""No you don't."" Harry rose to his feet, his face quickly turning from friendly and happy to evil and twisted.

""What do you...Harry, what's going on?"" Her voice was trembling, though not as much as other ""damsels in distress"". Odd.

""I didn't want you to find out this way, but I've worked too hard to see it all fall apart now. Samantha, I'm going to take you hostage now.""

He took a step towards her chair, and she instinctively recoiled away. ""Harry, you're scaring me.""

""That's good. That's a normal reaction when Mentalus is threatening you.""

""M...Mentalus? You're Mentalus?"" Her voice wasn't trembling at all now. She almost sounded mad.

""That's right. I'm the reason you have your job, and my men are enacting my latest attack on 1st National Bank tonight. Unfortunately, they're not performing well, so I have to step in and save them. You'll make a fine bargaining chip.""

""But what about our date? What about us?""

Harry sighed. ""I wanted to find true love, but my first true love is controlling this city. Now, come along, before I blast your head clean...why are you smiling?""

She was smiling, even almost laughing. ""It all makes sense now. Acquisitions? You meant stealing! And your management position was as overlord of Oakland!"" The other patrons of the restaurant were now turning to look at the lovers' spat.

""Stop it! I mean it! I will annihilate you!""

Samantha wiped a tear from her eye. ""Thanks, Mentalus. I haven't laughed that hard since I started this job."" She turned to face the dining room. ""Everyone, please make an orderly exit. This is gonna get messy.""

""You're right about that, Samantha,"" Harry growled. ""Your blood all over the walls, the ceiling falling on...STOP LAUGHING!""

""I can't help it! You get text alerts from your minions! How do you think the police contact Power Lass when they need help?"" Her eyes started to glow red as she began to float above the floor. ""You really know how to show a girl a good time.""",Blees-o-tron

[WP] A super-hero/heroine and their arch nemesis go on a date together as their alter egos. Neither of them know who the other actually is.,ThatSlyDevlin,"Burn Warden returned to their apartment after successfully thwarting another villainous scheme by the diabolical Disaster Master. She pulled off the face-covering mask and suit, stowing them in the closet before showering off. Normally she would leave them out for a few hours to let them air off (and allow the sweat to dry out before hanging it up), but she had a date tonight and didn't want to forget to put it away. Revealing that you were a superhero wasn't something you wanted to do on the first date, she'd learned that the hard way.

Of course, when acting like a perfectly normal girl (using her real name, Ashley Burns), she would have to avoid using any snappy puns which might trigger her powers. Igniting yourself in the middle of a meetup, much like revealing your heroing pastime, was something you at least waited until the third date for.

Ashley stroked her cat Percival as she decided what to wear. She would probably go with a dress this time.

-------
On the other side of town, Disaster Master threw off his fire retardant robe and gas mask. Burn Warden had nearly gotten through this time, their wordplay was clearly getting better. He might even have to get another layer on his suit before their next encounter. But those were concerns for later, right now he had to get ready. He showered and cleared up the little bit of stubble that had accrued since he last shaved.

He cleared a bit of space from his work station in his home lab and took a quick look at his handheld death ray. Well, it was more of a stun ray as far as function goes, but ""death ray"" sounded cooler. While grand machines that can cause earthquakes and tornadoes might be fun, you can't beat the personal touch of a laser to the face.

His assistant Klasgore stumbled into the room, still a bit dazed from the heat. Klasgore wasn't too bright, but he was loyal and the Master would feel a bit guilty leaving him to fend for himself.

""Master, where are you going?""

""Got a date tonight. I doubt the death ray will be getting much use, but you know well enough it isn't safe to wander this city unarmed.""

""Of course master, but what should I do while you're away?""

""Clean the main area up and wash some of the lab equipment. If I end up bringing her back here I'll tell you what to do then, but I wouldn't hold my breathe on that front.""

""You sell yourself short Master, but I will do this. Good luck.""

""Yeah, yeah. There's some fruit on the counter and leftover lasagna in the fridge if you get hungry.""

He walked into his bedroom, Klasgore had laid out some fancier clothes that the usual t-shirt and jeans. Probably for the best, wouldn't want his date to think her pal Daniel Masters was a slob who couldn't even get dressed up for their first outing.

------
In her normal person persona the hero waited at the restaurant for her date to arrive. He showed up wearing a collared shirt and khakis.

""Hey Ashley, you're looking nice.""

""Thanks Dan, I didn't know you owned a collared shirt.""

""Surprises abound.""

They took their seats at a table and Ashley kicked up a conversation while waiting for the wait staff.

""What do you do for a living anyway?""

""I work as an inventor mostly. Build stuff nobody has ever seen before and sell it for profit.""

""Really? That counts as a career?""

""I know, it's not quite as esteemed as working as a cashier in a deli, but it pays the bills.""

She sneered at him playfully. He came by the deli occasionally, but until now she wasn't sure where he got the money to pay for things. It did make sense, and would explain those little burns she noticed showing up on his arms occasionally.

The waitress took their orders and left. Dan started the conversation this time.

""How's your cat doing?""

""Good... Wait, how'd you know I had a cat?""

""You have a bit of hair on your dress.""

""Dammit, I thought I brushed it off. Sorry, I probably look like a mess.""

""You look fine, it's not really visible except when you stand.""

Their food came soon after, and things went well. Ashley even resisted the urge to say ""Master Baster"" when Dan mentioned he had cooked a turkey the week before.

-------
They left the restaurant, and were walking together back toward her apartment. Things were peaceful, up until someone tried to mug them.

""I hate this city, can't walk fifty feet without someone trying to hold you up.""

Dan was right, this city might be her home, but it is kind of rough. The mugger was holding a knife and standing as if he was ready to use it.

""Just hand over your wallets and I won't skin ya both.""

""Let me guess, if we do hand them over you'll only stab one of us?""

""Hey, looks like this guy knows how things work around here. Come on out boys, we might have a party with this nice couple.""

Naturally, there were two more behind him. Ashley scraped at her mind to think of a snappy pun. It didn't have to be great, just seeing the flames would probably scare them off. Dan would probably understand, he had seemed alright and this was a situation where lighting up was probably acceptable. The thugs were getting closer.

""This guy doesn't look too SHARP!""

In a split second her arms lit up with a dull blaze, and Dan pulled a scifi-looking gun out of his coat. It looked rather familiar. They both glanced at each other in surprise before Dan pegged one of the guys in the shoulder. All the muscles in the thug's body started spasming and he collapsed to the ground.

The other two grabbed their buddy and hauled him away. Seems they have the courage to save their friend, and lack the idiocy to take on two well armed people.

""Burn Warden?""

""Disaster Master?""

""Well, I had fun, up until this little encounter. Should we pretend it never happened?""

""I doubt we could pull that off. We'll either need to call off the whole relationship or get new nemeses.""

""Nemeses are easy to find, same time next week?""

""See you then.""

"[WP] Monday morning, you wake up and realize you're in your childhood bed. All memories from your life are intact but it's the first day of High School.",_What_a_Cunt_,"Wait, school in 30 mins? What the hell!? I open my eyes and realize everything is wrong. Wait, not wrong...different. This isn't my room. This isn't my bed. I call out to my wife, thinking maybe I just passed out drunk last night (though I don't remember drinking) and she played a prank. Or maybe there was an accident of some sort, but then I remember the voice that spoke. That wasn't Marie. I look around the room again, stare at the forty inch tv, the large cassette player and ratty speakers on my dresser. And then my brain finally catches on. This is my room, but not the one I fell asleep in at the age of 41 with Marie, my wife of eleven years. This is the same room I slept in as a 16 year old. I'm in my foster mom's house back in New York. What. The. Hell.

I stumble out of bed and head to the bathroom next door to my room, my body remembering the details but my mind elsewhere. My two kids. My wife. My job. This has got to be a dream. I avoid the mirror at first and splash cold water on my face, even pinch the skin on the back of my elbow hard. And then I look in the mirror, and the little wrinkles, the scars, the silver hairs...all gone. In place of the curly hair I let grow out (my wife had been begging me to do so again for over a year), my hair is dark, short cropped. Just the way I kept it back then. Wait, now. Fuck. FUCK! I start breathing faster, get a little dizzy and realize I need to chill. Taking a deep breath, I let it out slowly, counting as I release the air from my lungs. I have two choices: accept that this is a dream and proceed accordingly until I wake up, or accept that this is my reality and I'm either crazy or entirely sane and this is really happening. I didn't feel crazy, so maybe dream it is. Might a well enjoy myself until the crazy shit that usually happens in dreams starts kicking in. But I know my dreams, dreams where I start hovering, or suddenly teleport around to places half remembered, fighting zombies and villains and whatever else my subconcious throws my way. This feels...real. As real as the life I left behind. Was this a second chance? To undo the mistakes I made, be less of an asshole in my life? Christ, not get into the mounds of debt I found/find myself in?

And what about my kids? Is there some alternate reality going where I'm still the older me, still working a job being a glorified data monkey that I couldn't stand to make all of our lives better? Did I die in my sleep, and this is my reincarnation? My brain is starting to hurt with all the possibilities. If this is real, would the changes I make undo everything I've done in my life? My *other* life...

""10 minutes, Anthony! Move your butt, boy, before you're late for your first day!"" That's my foster mother, Janet. I was back to being a ward of the state, back to being a skinny, geeky kid who was afraid of everything, who didn't know how to talk to girls, played D&amp;D with my friends on the weekends. Friends I would meet soon. And suddenly I know in my heart what makes sense. Get to school. Be a better person. Be a *smarter* person. 

I stride back to my room and quickly get dressed, throwing on my baggy jeans and a Transformers T-Shirt (G1, my brain throws at me). I realize I'm swimming in my clothes. Yeah, wardrobe definitely needs a change. I look like a fucking idiot! I grab my backpack and run down the stairs.

""Bye, Janet! Thanks for the wake-up!"" She waves to me as I run out the door and down the block. And the running...my god! My knee no longer hurts. It feels like I'm moving so fast. Excercise. All the working out I do later in life, I'll start it now, not rely on my fast metabolism to save the day. And my art! All the techniques I've worked on in the past (future) few years, it's there, ready to be used, to expand on...I could start a totally different career!

As I run the few blocks to Newmark Free Academy, the public high school I would be starting in this year (my sophomore year), I think about things I'll miss. My smart phone. Internet. Wifi everywhere. God, Starbucks! And then something else clicks: these companies haven't really started yet, have they? Google...I'll befriend some adults, teachers I meet through mutual friends in a few years. I can learn about finances, stock trading, see if I can get them to open accounts for me...the after school jobs I get, instead of blowing the money on crap I'll never see again, I can invest it. Get a car at 17 instead of 25. Build better habits of saving now. Live better.

When I reach the school and see of all of kids (christ they look so young!) milling about, most heading in, I suddenly see *my* kids, my five year old daughter, her curly brown hair and mischevious. My twelve year old son, his face so much like my own. I see their smiles, hear their laughter, and the tears fill my eyes, blur my vision. Will I ever see them again? Will I make the right choices, still meet my wife, meet the woman who helped me become a better man than I had any right to be? I don't know.

But I'm going to find out.",fooflam

I have a dream...

In my dream I'm an old man. Sitting on a recliner, watching television. It's a show,  a weird show, its like a movie. And I'm in the movie, my younger self. And I watch the man who looks like me live a boring mundane life. Hes at the grocery store, buying food, and you can see in his eyes that hes not really there. Somewhere along the way he has become vacant.
Somewhere along the way he died a little inside, and hes just going through the motions.
Hes at the gas station, putting in gas into the family van, and hes just staring at the stars.
He remembers when he was a younger kid at school, how they would give you the idea that everyone could one day be an astronaut and travel to the moon.
The man is sitting there in front of the television now, he seems inebriated, and in my dream I watch him slowly age, all while sitting in front of the television. And the movie ends, and it shows a reflection. The screen becomes like a mirror and I see myself sitting there . An old man, bald, sad and vacant.

And then I wake up.

I smell pancakes, and I hear music. I hear a knock on the door and hear the familiar sound of my mothers voice telling me to get ready for school.
I look down at the pyramid in my pants, It feels like I have an  impossible to suppress hard on.
I also feel extremely energetic, I get up in a frenzy and rush to the mirror.
Am I in another dream? Or have I gone back in time? Is that really me in my reflection?
I need to find a calendar. Or something.
Where did we always use to keep one?
I rush down to the refrigerator in the kitchen, and I almost faint at what I see.


.....


That's a cool writing prompt. I'm not going to write out how his whole life plays out. But I thought that would be a cool way to start it, an old regretful man whos become what most old men become. Jaded and vacant. And then he wakes up to get another chance at life, maybe he joins the military and ends up dying early, or maybe, knowing how his last life played out he takes more chances in life, or maybe it depresses him and he kills himself.

He shook his head and I took a deep breath, staring down at the bowl of steamed rice. Rice with sticks? Seriously? I pushed the plate away. ""Do you have spoons?"" I asked and he handed me a ladle. ""Seriously?"" He nodded and I tossed it aside. ""How the hell do you eat soup?""

""Soup? With spork,"" he answered and I nearly broke his little neck right then and there as he handed me a spork. ""We only use spork and knife. Fewer dishes that way.""

Sometimes it's the simple things that crush you; the complex abstractions are easy to grasp. Being told that you don't have a house anymore. Being forced to sleep two hundred to a small, thin hut. You accept those rules; they become part of who you are from the moment the gunpowder scent dissipates, and the Prince Rupert's drop of sweat on your brow shatters the silence of tyranny. But access to such a simple thing denied... Kills part of your humanity.  

We never asked for anything after the machines were shut off and the Americans came and gave us blankets and lead us from Hell. We just wanted our lives back, even though we knew they no longer existed. When you stand upon your childhood playground and look out over the rubble and soot and death, the world seems quieter. 

When we arrived in the rehabilitation centers, the shock of white walls and clean sheets wrinkled our skin like angry bulls free of the sword, looking to kill the matador. Every room was a prison cell, every meal; salvation. But the grit on our fingers and brains dirtied more than just the porcelain under the weight of freedom.  

We became the soul of what suffering meant to the world after that day. We stood and screamed our exclamations to everyone and the people clapped politely at the spectacle we had created. Fury burned in us at such injustice. Dammation couldn't save humanity if they were blind to what we had stood for and for what we had become. 

My mother always called me Little Leaf when I was young; now my name echoes through the emtpy walls in the apartment complex we call ""home"". The coarseness of Hell followed us home, and the niceties of something so simple as nickname died with its arrival. 

So here I sit, looking at a plate of green beans and rice, and think to myself as I cry.

[WP] Tom Cruise and John Travolta are leaders of two opposing schisms of Scientology.,portablebagel,"Mr. Cruise whisked the sweat from his brow in one clean sweep as Mr. Travolta approached. Cruise saw right through Travolta's powerful stance, and the aura of knowledge he carried with himself. Both men were equally gifted, and Cruise knew that he would make it a tough match. They both knew all of the universes truths, and there was no turning back now. In the name of Hubbard, one would finish the other and become the alpha male of Scientology. The gift of a throne bathed in complete knowledge was only moments away, guaranteed by the victory to come. The tension, fully palpable. The risks, fully recognized. The reward, irresistible. It was time, and there was no turning back. The empires these men had built around themselves had been set to face off since the day they were formed. It was destiny. 

The lights around the men dimmed, and an object began its automated protrusion from the ceiling. Cruise searched his mind for any clue of what the tactic that Travolta was using might be. He was left clueless and stunned, as a mellow beat began to play softly in the background growing slowly in pitch, and the object on the ceiling revealed itself to be a super-mega sized disco ball. Cruise then realized what was happening, why Travolta insisted on meeting on this particular day at this particular time. It was a Saturday, and it was at night. Travolta began to rock his waist gently from side to side, increasing his thrust as the beat led the pace. Growing louder and louder, the other sounds began to chime in. ""Night fever"" had begun. Cruise had never starred in a musical before. The closest he had come to this was his scene in risky business, and that came nowhere close to Travolta's grip on disco. He knew he had lost before the dance had even fully started. He stared onward, gazing upon the performance that would soon solidify his defeat. It was then that Travolta kicked his thrusts into full gear, waving his arms and kicking waist in a rhythmic pace to the soothing tone of the Bee Gee's. With this, Cruise's last branch of hope snapped, sending him on a volley to the ground, swallowed in depression and defeat. How could he have let this happen ? He was the ruler of Hollywood and all beyond as far as he could see. He knew all of the universes deepest secrets, thanks to his perfectly formatted religion. He was the best looking man he'd ever seen. All of this, and Travolta still defeated him. Cruise's empire crumbled all at once, and he was forever defeated this display of absolute superiority. 

Travolta's scientology went on to win over the hearts of billions. The religion dominated the entire world and everyone realized how perfect it was all along. How blatantly stupid they had all been before for not trusting in the ways of Hubbard.

Cruise never recovered from his loss, and spent the majority of his remaining years studying disco moves. 

Travolta became emperor and overlord of all that ever was and will be. ",-FatASStronaut-
"[WP] Upon the death of a famous man, renowned people from all over the world clammer to give the eulogy. It is discovered that the man had already picked someone to give the eulogy, but no one can figure out why he made the choice, or even how/if the two knew each other. Write this eulogy.",thecoverstory,"The masses of people stacked into the cathedral turned their murmurs into silence. A man, who looked not too dissimilar to the deceased ascended the stain glass illuminated stairs. 
The priest made way at the lectern, as the suited man laid out his papers before the audience. 
""Ahem."" Echoed the broken voice throughout the space. The man looked up nervously from his speech as he surveyed the hundreds of glinting eyes in the room. 
""I know I don't know him as well as maybe many others in this place. I can't speak about all the great things he has achieved nor break down his brilliance and methods."" The man's eyes lifted to the ceiling. 
""Heck, I can't even tell you a story from a time where we shared a drink."" As he looked  back down, every person in the room felt like he was looking right at them.
""Yet, he picked me."" He said simply. ""I am not famous. I am not interesting. I am not brilliant, boast-worthy or beautiful."" His hand reached for his glasses and slid them down his sweating nose. 
""Yet he picked me."" He gestured with his glasses aloft.
""Why."" The room grew silenter still. The man looked down at the lectern, distracted.

""Who here has felt love?

Do not hesitate within yourself for if you know you'd know."" The man tacked on hastily after a considerable pause.
""It is more than sex and breasts and lips. And more than muscles, eyes and brawn."" He fiddled with his hands as his gaze rose to the back of the room.
""It is complete and utter understanding. Understanding of another's true self.

You look into their eyes and see beyond emotion, retina's and a brain. You forget existence and they are all that there is, a complete ensemble. Something in and of itself.""

People in the front row began to notice an absent minded playing with a gold ring in his hand. Then, the man became aware and plunked it heavily onto the lectern. ""I know this because I felt this once."" The energy in the room lifted as people exchanged meaningful looks between them. 

""Someone I understood was so special that I would let nothing take them away from me. I looked past their eyes and they past mine. We truly got to know each other without saying a word."" His head fell.

""It was perfect. In the true sense of the word.""

The man's weary eyes locked eyes with a lady in the front row. 

""Only something more special than perfection could ruin it for me."" He gestured at the coffin. ""For he too saw past the blue veil."" The lady in the front row now showed her blue eyes begin to weep. 

The man pocketed the ring. ""I said I would let nothing get between us."" The crowd began to look at each other nervously. ""And it does seem strange that he came to me before passing. But he knew his time was up, and that it was time to keep my promise."" 

""A promise to myself I knew better than to keep, or was at best too weak to."" Stained sunlight reflected off the wet corners of his eyes. He inhaled deeply.

""He was a great man."" He stared off lost into the beams of light. ""I truly believe that she did see through my eyes. But I think through his she just saw more.""

The silence lasted until a gentle tolling of a distant bell could be heard in the distance.

""He must have been a great man."" He uttered, before collecting his papers and walked distantly down the stairs and the aisle of the church. His eyes fixed straight ahead, he daren't let them wander towards the first row.

[WP] A sitcom character is stranded in the real world,2lbsincemonday,"""So then I said, 'That's not a gorilla, that's my wife!'""

A few moments of silence passed. *Huh*, thought Jack, *where's the laughter?* His coworkers would usually burst into raucous laughter, but there'd also be laughter coming from all around him. Every joke anyone told, there was laughter. He looked at the group of people around him and saw them smiling nervously, unsure how to react to his joke, before Sue changed the subject.

""So, did you all get invited to Dylan's leaving party?"" she asked the group, cheerfully.

""Yeah,"" replied Rob, ""But I'm not sure if I'll go. I've never really gotten along with Dylan, there'd probably be an atmosphere if I went.""

Jack tried to insert himself into the chatter here and there, but all his attempts at good-humoured mocking and joking were met with uncomfortable silence, people clearing their throats and carrying on as if he'd said nothing. He excused himself and went back to his desk, back to work, convincing himself that he was overreacting.

On the drive home from work, he remembered that he and his wife, Ashley, had had an argument that morning. *What was it about?* he wondered, trying to figure out if it was bad enough that she'd still hold it against him. He stopped off at a florist and bought a big bouquet of flowers, colourful and beautiful, just in case. *She always loves when I buy her flowers, she can never stay mad at me now*, Jack thought, smugly. With that, the weirdness of his work day faded into non-existence.

""Ash, I'm home!"" he called to her as he entered the house, flowers clutched tightly, ready for the apology he'd rehearsed on the drive home.

She came out of the kitchen, red hair tied back into a ponytail, her latest culinary concoction painting her apron. ""Hey, how was work?"" she asked, her words warm but her tone betraying her, icy and distant.

Jack's smile faltered. ""Ah, you're still mad at me. Ash, listen, I know you're upset with me about what we spoke about this morning, and...and you're right. Completely."" He watched her face carefully, waiting for the moment her expression softened, but it hadn't yet, so he continued. ""I was an idiot, I shouldn't have said those things. I really am sorry, I don't like to see you angry or upset.  And I especially hate it when I'm the cause of it. Please, honey, I am sorry."" He couldn't see his face, but he was giving her his best puppy-dog eyes, he was sure. 

After a few seconds of silence, Ashley spoke. ""What, that's it?"" she asked, arms folded across her chest. ""You tell me you want me to put my dad in a home because you 'never get to see me' anymore because, God forbid, I spend a few hours of a few days out of the week taking care of him...and I get a stupid half-hearted apology?"" Her eyes bored into Jack's with a fiery intensity that made him shrink, visibly. He held up the bouquet of flowers, pitifully, wordlessly, as though it would make all the difference.

""No, yeah, great. Thanks, Jack, flowers, that magically cures your selfishness.""

Suddenly, Jack found his words again, in the form of comedy, as his words usually are. All too quickly, he spoke. ""Wow. I've apologised but you're being really confrontational. Must be that time of the month, huh? Ha ha.""

Ashley looked like she was about to explode, before shutting her eyes and taking a calming breath. Then she looked at Jack, who was no longer laughing, but had eyes as wide as a deer's when caught in the headlights. ""Sexist jokes now, because I don't think an apology is a solution for the reason for our argument. That's nice."" With that, she walked back to the kitchen and left Jack alone in the living room with his confusion.

""Why is everyone so weird today?"" he mumbled to himself. Something was bothering him, something felt off. He cast his mind back to yesterday, when he *knew* everything had been normal. 

Then it hit him. He'd met some weird old lady on the street, asking for money. She was obviously an alcoholic, Jack had concluded at the time, so he refused, telling her that her difficult circumstances are a product of her own bad choices, and that you can make it in life, successfully, by simply making good choices. ""What did she say?"" Jack asked himself, wracking his brain. ""Seeing how smoothly my life would be if I wasn't handed everything on a piece of paper? Yeah, that was it. What the hell does that have to do wi-""

He gasped. He *had* been handed everything on a piece of paper, that was his life. That was what was missing! The realisation dawned on him and hit him like a truck. ""Oh, crap!"" he exclaimed.

*Laughter*

Jack looked at the wall and, addressing no-one in particular, whispered, ""I'm home."" A tear rolled down his cheek.",HippieSoulPunx

In the lobby, an average looking middle aged man nodded, slapped his knees and stood up.
""That's me,"" he said as he walked towards the man in the suit.

""Great. It's nice to finally meet you in person and to be able to put a face to a name. I'm George.""

""Yes. Same to you. Or uh... Same goes for you.""

George lowered his eyes at Michael. ""Right... So come on in."" He opened his arms and gestured Michael into his office. Michael put his head down, leaned forward and walked in.

Michael and George both sat down at the mahogany desk across from each other. Michael intertwined his fingers together in his lap.

""So let's get this started. I see you worked at Dunder Mifflin for a good while... selling paper?""

""Yes. Well I sold paper first, then I became manager.""

""Okay. So what did you do as the manager?""

Michael was confused. 

""Well I, uh, you know, managed people. I kept the office running. Kept a smooth ship. I was the leader of the pack. You know, like a pack of wolves - we were like a family. It was very family oriented. A family oriented environment that I... that I ran.""

Michael seemed pleased with himself.

""Okay great. That sounds good. Could you tell me some of your accomplishments?""

Michael nodded. He knew he'd ace this question.

""Oh yeah. My branch was always the best branch in the company. We always led in sales.""

""Okay. That's really all I need for today. It's been a plea-.""

""THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID!"" Michael blurted out before George could get out his last syllable.

George squinted again at Michael. After blinking a few times, he opened his mouth.

""Please get out of my office.""

Michael's face contorted towards a smile, then a frown. Then he stood up and walked out.

""It was nice meeting you George,"" he said without turning around. 

Later that day, George sat in his desk on a phone call with a colleague.

""Yeah, he looked great on paper. I just don't know about the interview. He was so strange. Yeah, no I can't really explain it. He made me feel really uncomfortable and awkward. But at some times I wanted to laugh, but I knew I couldn't because it wouldn't be appropriate. Yeah, weird right? Anyway, we're not gonna offer him the job. No one in their right mind would hire this guy. I find it hard to believe that this 'Dunder Mifflin' place even exists... Anyway, I'll talk to you on Monday.""

EMERGENCY ALERT!!!!

A large vessel has landed on the surface here it is filled with humans from earth they cannot distinguish us from the rest of the rocks that make up the surface of the planet they call ""Mars"". There are many humans we will continue to watch them and report on their doings. 

Report 2: they have constructed a large complex of domes and they appear to be preparing to stay this is not good.


Emergency report!!!!! 
It has been 340 days since they landed a large dust storm forced us all into hibernation for a month and not only has the complex grown there are now many smaller humans they must be newly born. How is that possible in such a short time?! We are in danger already one of our scouts was killed in the building while the sandstorm was going on we do not know if this was intentional or merely mistaken identity. 


Report 5: 1.5 years since landing
I have now gotten reports that there have been two other landings in different sections of the planet. And more ships have landed at the original complex it is so massive now that we cannot hope to watch it all going into hibernation for storms is dangerous they work fast and seem to breed even faster the number of infants and young humans is beyond count and more seem to appear every day. 

Report 6: 2 years since first landing
We now know of 6 settlements all over the planet we must speak with the humans now they are building some giant device that we've heard them say will let them live outside the domes. We have finally decided to attempt contact with the humans in hopes that we can coexist peacefully.

""There were few reports after that from the stone people of the sol system, sir, and when  we went to look for ourselves the settlements were there and there was plant life growing, that shouldn't be possible but... Our best guess is that the humans have discovered terraforming and it made the planet unlivable for the other species that existed there we are unsure if contact was established but we fear the worst. Humans have left their planet and are seeking to colonize all they can. There are very few choices left"" ",Deamondread21

His grandfather rubbed his eyes with the back of his forearm, then looked at the readout on his portal gun, ""This, urp, says we're on Shan Shen, some kind of, blerg, Psuedo-Sino planet or something."" Rick dug a flask out of his coat, drained it, and tossed it over his shoulder. It hit a redheaded woman square between the shoulders.

""Oy!"" Donna Noble grunted, spinning around. She picked up the flask and shook it belligerently. ""Who threw this?!""

Morty began to stammer even harder. ""Aw, man, Rick...you, you really pissed off that woman, you know?"" Suddenly, he stopped, mouth agape. ""You speak English?""

""Of course I speak English, I'm British!"" Donna stepped over to them, still brandishing the flask. ""So, Old Man, are you going to apologize or not?""

Rick rolled his eyes and scratched his chest. He made no move to apologize or retrieve the offending item. Morty edged behind his grandfather as the British woman moved closer. He though she was going to shove the flask up Rick's nose. Just as Morty was about to ask his grandfather to just do as she asked, a tall, skinny man dressed in a suit and trench coat joined her. 

""Well, well, what have we here then?"" the strange man smiled benignly at the trio. He had spiky brown hair and a friendly grin. Donna Noble turned to him and gestured with the flask towards Rick, ""This old coot hit me with his flask!""

""Now now, I'm sure it was an accident,"" her companion soothed her with a tilt of his head. ""Just give it back and let's get going."" He put one hand on her elbow, and with the other took the offending item out of her hand, returning it to Rick.

""There now, all better! Come along Donna."" The tall man turned around and took off into the crowd.

""Doctor, wait!"" she cried, sparing a moment to stick her tongue out at the old man before hurrying after the Doctor.

I asked tentatively. Heo did not deserve to hear distress within my voice. He's been helping me for a very long time. It would not be fair to fill the air with disrespect; the air we breathed was stale enough. 

Yet, like a hungry rat crawling through a corpses brain for food, a repressed thought tried to fight it's way to the front of my skull.

How can you fix a submarine, when you've never fixed a submarine?

""I am very sure Chen. Do you doubt my abilities?"" His monotonous accent showed no signs of emotion, but his reply painted smile on Chen's face. 

""Nope, of course not. I know being trapped on the sea floor is not a goal of yours."" This made Heo smile. His face glowed red. The reflection the com log screen glinted, appearing in the corner of his glasses. 

""Are we all set then?"" Said chen, with both arms resting against his chest in a crossed position. 

""Does a 40% chance of survival sound appealing to you?"" 

""Better than the 0% chance we have staying here.""

Chen was right, they had no chance of surviving in vault 111. Every second spent in the cargo bay was a major risk. An unhatched escaped door would let the disease in.

Time of death after first contact was 3 hours. 

""Let's do this"" Cheered Heo, speaking with emotion for the first time since Chen had met him.

He pounded on the ignition, shoved forward the throttle stick, and almost closed his eyes out of fear. They were heading straight into a rock wall. 

BOOM. Heo's eyes never closed. He kept them open out of the pure thrill of anticipation. This was his defining moment. In their report studies, the escape submarine was protected by a false rock wall. A brilliant design to protect the secrecy of the vault, too bad it had to be ripped apart from the inside out.

Their ship had blasted right through the wall, and the two found themselves in the ocean, with nothing to see but plenty to do. A two man crew mean four times as much work, with tasks ranging from pressure checking to engine lubricating. 

But to say the work in front of them is great, and the stress will be fatiguing, is to assume they will be making it back to China. Where they will meet with other survivor who have been through the great ordeal, and want to start their lives anew. 

I have good news and bad news. The good news is actually a news report on my lunch. A turkey sandwich sided with a bowl of applesauce. An american classic.

The bad news is not good news. Their submarine is sinking to the bottom of the ocean.

Heo forgot to fill it with gas.

In the young man's eyes, something difficult to describe: a knowing spark of wit, perhaps, accentuated by the slight curve of a lip at its vanishing point. *Portrait #3,* it's called, although the artist never painted a #1 or 2. In the background, a surreal landscape of swirls and mist.  

For most of the world, the painting is black and white, a monochromatic statement on the complex joys of fatherhood. But I can see the full range of hues this artist used to paint, and to me the picture is something else entirely. I see much the same image, except for one small detail: to me, the man's long teeth are stained the unmistakable color of fresh-spilled blood.

"[WP] You and a dead artist share the ability to see colors others can't. His paintings become a global phenomenon, but his images are much more sinister than they appear.",PerpetuallyMeh,"I was not, strictly speaking, an artist, or even an art appreciator.

I viewed it, yes, but only for the subversive thrill of knowing that what *I* saw in the art, was not what anyone *else* saw in the art. This thrill was not even unique to art - I could get it just by walking in a park, or looking at a billboard, or simply admiring a sunset. In each of these, there is a color that you - most likely - cannot imagine. Did you know that ice is not transparent, but rather has a brilliant hue? That the sun *always* flashes before it falls below the horizon, and that those rare 'green flashes' are just occasional glimpses the normal man gets at a brilliant experience I can see every day? This color I call octarine. I do not know what others call it, for I have never met another who can see it.

If you do know these things, you might already know what I am about to share. But if you have not heard the name Kurt LeMutre, or seen his works of 'art', then you should continue. But read with haste - for this tale is a warning to you, and others like you, just as Kurt LeMutre's paintings were to me.

I was in a gallery for an exhibition. As I said, occasionally, the whimsy strikes me to see the pigments in the art that others cannot. I can't imagine what it looks like to them, so for this reason I can't consider myself an art aficionado or critic... I navigate a wholly different territory than them, and the pictures I see, the experiences I have, I must keep to myself.

This particular day, I remember clearly. The door had been left open to the winter air. It was chilly in the gallery, and I had drawn my coat around me, my teeth still chattering from walking outside. My scarf, my gloves, none of it kept the winter air from my skin. I was perusing the new pieces from up-and-coming artists, amused to note one of them had stained their painting horribly with octarine, obscuring the picture entirely... and as I came to the end, I saw Kurt LeMutre's now-famous work, ""Space Enough"".

It was certainly a lovely painting, of an abstract sort. But there was a *message*, written on top of his work - 

""If you can see this you are being hunted. Run. Hide."" 

This was my first time being greeted with the knowledge that someone else out there could see this color, shared my abnormality, what I had *considered* my gift... I hadn't known what to expect. Perhaps I would be delighted to have someone to share my experiences with? Or maybe jealous, that my secret picture of the world was being spied upon by another?  I didn't know.

What I certainly didn't expect was that it would be a *tragedy*, a *horror*. I stepped backwards, thinking to run away - to escape the dreadful omen. But then I realized I couldn't - I needed to know more. What had happened to this artist? Was he alive? Could I get into contact with him? I needed to understand his message, his words to me - to *us*, as there could perhaps be others. It could perhaps even be a prank, a joke - but no. The words were written with horrible emotion, thrown onto a piece that was lovingly made... it was a desperate attempt to get his message out there, I realized. He needed people to see it, and putting it on his piece was how he did that. I realized this with an instant understanding, as if there was some greater connection beyond our shared ability.

I turned, to find the gallerist. He was talking up another piece, and I waited impatiently - desperate to hide my fear, to not *reveal* myself, in case I was being hunted even now. Eventually, the gallerist was freed, so I stepped up and inquired about Kurt LeMutre, the artist in the up-and-coming section.

""Ah, LeMutre? I'm pleased you have an eye for him as I did,"" He said, turning to appraise the painting once more. ""There's a small section in memorial for him in the back. He died recently, you see. A suicide... as many great artists go.""

The gallerist was momentarily remorseful, before continuing, now made solemn - ""He was a friend. I enjoyed his work, and I was one of the few who did. But recently, just before his death, he edited many of his pieces, perhaps inspired by his sorrow, or frustration, that led to his untimely death,"" The gallerist paused, nodding to the painting I had seen. ""This one, for example, has had particularly strong reactions after the edit.""

I was stunned. I said nothing, and the gallerist took this as quiet contemplation. He nodded, as if thinking to himself, then turned to me, a sad smile on his face.

""If you'd like to see the rest of his work, as I said, we have a memorial. After his edit, his works have become popular. I recommend perusing them today, as many will be bought before the exhibit is removed tomorrow.""

I thanked him for his time, and retreated to the back of the gallery, trampling over my thoughts as I did so. This artist - he was dead, by his own hand, supposedly. Clearly this was no prank, now - there was something serious going on here. Could he have been killed, and the murder manipulated to become a seeming suicide? Or perhaps he had killed himself to escape that fate? Artists apparently often become popular or profitable after a tragic death... he could have killed himself to avoid his pursuers, and to save others by making his message more widespread. That was undoubtedly the 'edits' the gallerist had talked of.

The memorial gallery was silent as a tomb, and the atmosphere was about as rich with miasma. People stood before paintings, appreciating them, letting themselves sink into the experience. On the wall, a photograph of LeMutre looked over the entire gallery with piercing eyes, and the unmistakable expression of an artist - an appraising face, with eyes that took the world into some internal machine and converted it into something of their own. In life, he must have made quite an impression. In death, he made an even larger one.

I looked over the paintings - all of them had his edits. He had specialized in small paintings, so none could fit much more than the original message he left, to my dismay. But one in particular said something more -

""This color is being used. It kills. If you can see it, destroy it, run, hide.""

I shivered. What did this message mean? How could someone *kill* with a color? Certainly, octarine was unique among colors - I had looked into it, and it had nothing to do with energy and radiation like the other colors did. It was less a color and more a *presence*, without any evidence or scientific explanation. But... a color can't kill. 

Yet, I thought more. After the edit, the painting in the front - it had elicited *strong reactions*, the gallerist said. And indeed, looking over the room, these people... they were appreciating and contemplating, on the surface, but there was an undercurrent of tension, of fear, that they perhaps didn't realize they were feeling. The *room* had struck me as deathly, and fearful, not just the paintings. Could they be subconsciously experiencing the messages LeMutre had left for people like me? Could my color not be as much a secret as I thought it was?",TyrRev

"[WP] You and a dead artist share the ability to see colors others can't. His paintings become a global phenomenon, but his images are much more sinister than they appear.",PerpetuallyMeh,"I shook my head. This wasn't the time or the place to think. I needed to get out of here, to escape this message - perhaps drown it under copious amounts of alcohol. I turned to leave, and found myself face-to-face with a towering man in a black suit, with an octarine tattoo of a skull overlaid on top of his face. I flinched backwards with a start, and apologized for almost bumping into him. 

He was tall, and lean - muscular, but still skinny. His face was gaunt, befitting his tattoo, and he had close-cropped pale blond hair. And his eyes were a drab gray, empty of any emotion as he scanned over me. I felt like I was being inspected, evaluated. I waited patiently for a response.

After what felt like a lifetime, he replied amiably, ""No problem, Mr...?"" He raised an eyebrow. 

Hastily, I supplied an alter ego I had used years ago in college on a fake ID. I had used it enough for occasions where I didn't want to give out my name, that it came naturally to me.

""Mr. Graine,"" The man with the skull tattoo said, introducing himself. We shook hands, and he looked around the room, a smile coming to his thin lips. ""How do you like LeMutre's work? This is my first time seeing it, myself.""

I was desperately hoping I wouldn't start sweating. I kept myself from looking at his tattoo - which I was suddenly *sure* was deliberate, to provoke a reaction that this Graine could use to filter out those who could see octarine, and those who couldn't. Instead, I decided to look around at the paintings myself, with a smile of my own.

""Mine as well,"" I said, speaking as smoothly as I could. ""I came from the up-and-coming section. The gallerist said nothing but praise.""

""Oh?"" Graine said, turning to me, his smile plastered on still. ""I had a similar experience. 'Space Enough', it is... striking, is it not?""

I nodded. ""Yes. I couldn't begin to explain it. Normally I loathe abstract works, but this one, it was emotionally charged.""

Graine's smile abruptly transitioned - invisibly, like a switch was flipped - from false to sincere. I wished it had remained false... his sincere smile was filled with grim pleasure, like a torturer who took pride in his work. ""Indeed. I've heard that same response is common. Have you heard of *Stendhal syndrome?*"" He said conversationally, turning back to look over the audience in the room.

""I haven't, Mr. Graine,"" I said. This conversation was going on far longer than my liking, but I was desperate to seem as natural as possible. And I had to admit, if I couldn't see the skull tattoo, Graine would be charming, charismatic, and a pleasure to talk to. It was only because I could see *more* that I realized there was more to him.

""Stendhal was a French author. He visited Florence, and was so struck by the beauty of being surrounded by works of the great artists, that he experienced hallucinations, dizziness, and a rapid heartbeat. It is common among the art community,"" He said, and smiled. ""Supposedly, some have even been struck *dead* by works of art.""

I shivered out of fear, thankful that it was still cold in the gallery. ""Have they?"" I winced with drama, acting sympathetic. ""Seems an odd way to go.""

""I'm sure many would consider it a fine way to go. A revelation so great, so beautiful, that it takes one's life - that's quite poetic. Fitting of the arts,"" Graine said. He looked back to me. ""Anyway, I detain you, my good sir. Thank you for listening to my rambling.""

I nodded to him. ""Thank you for the fascinating conversation. And I am sorry for delaying you as well, Mr. Graine. I hope the rest of LeMutre's work strikes you as much as 'Space Enough'.""

He smiled, a wide grin that made the skull on his face seem all too real. ""Oh, it has. I already plan on buying it all."" He nodded to me, with false cheer. ""Have a good day.""

""You too, Mr. Graine,"" I said over my shoulder, already walking out of the horrible place.

-

Over the next year, despite Mr. Graine's efforts, more of LeMutre's work became world-renowned. His death had catapulted him into fame faster than Mr. Graine could buy up his omens - the message spread, thank God. There were more people like me, who had been warned that there was a conspiracy... and they could escape it.

But not everyone could see his omens.

Alongside the rise of LeMutre's stardom, there was a rise in *Stendhal syndrome*. Common men and women cried, weeped, screamed, laughed psychotically, at works of art. The media blamed a society that undervalues art, that watches TV rather than plays, browses the internet rather than galleries.

So too came death. Far less frequently, so the media never caught onto it. Many were of the particularly old or feeble, but as time went on, the ages got younger, the people in better health. The reports blamed heart attacks, aneurysms, unseen conditions, perhaps undetectable poisons. To the world, they were just mysterious, untimely deaths that happened in art galleries.

They couldn't see the connections - but I could. I obsessively tracked the people who died in art galleries while viewing 'art', and the paintings that brought about 'Stendhal syndrome'. I visited them, and the dread pieces of 'art'. I was careful - I covered my vision, to prevent myself from fully comprehending the works that lay before me. And each time, it was an intricately drawn pattern in octarine, like some seal from a diabolic grimoire. I looked upon the face of death that only I could see - and I was enraged. 

This is a story of warning - a cautionary tale. If you are like me, you must not reveal your abilities. Mr. Graine and his men - for I am sure it is Mr. Graine I am after - will kill you. I have been tracking these cases, as well. There have been at least five persons in the United States - three women, a man, and a young boy - who have been killed. Indeed, I've caught myself being followed on many occasions, and only quick thinking prevented me from being caught. 

They will attempt to provoke a reaction from you with an image in octarine. To others, it's blank, or a sign, or a flier - to you, it is repulsive, horrifying, shocking. You must not react. You must remain calm. If you reveal you can see it, you will be killed, I am sure of it. 

If you are *not* like me, do not visit an art gallery. Avoid paintings especially. Any of them could be your death, and you wouldn't even realize it.",TyrRev
"[WP] You and a dead artist share the ability to see colors others can't. His paintings become a global phenomenon, but his images are much more sinister than they appear.",PerpetuallyMeh,"It could technically happen, but with limitations. A person who sees more color is still seeing proper value (light/dark). It's difficult to do any kind of complex rendering without using a range of different lights and darks. If this were to appear in a painting and still 'disappear' to the eyes of a normal person, the values would have to be such that they blended in with the background. Even for a person that could technically see these colors, without value changes to bring it out of the background, it would be a subtle element when compared to the contrast that typically takes place near a focal point.

As an example of this: If you take one of the ishihara test images, and convert them to black and white, you won't be able to see the number. This is because the color dots are using a very simliar value. If the values were slightly darker or lighter on the number, a colorblind person would still be able to detect it, as they still see proper value. 

A person could be suggested using hue/saturation shifts in the background, or one might find a message. That being said, you wouldn't likely find an entire new focal-point type character, properly rendered and 'brought out' from the background.

[WP] A simple traffic stop gone terrestrial.,Runningturtle1,"Galorif gurgled.  Had he been human, he'd have sighed.  He pulled his ship out of the traffic, out of the way of the other ships, beside the spacelanes and parked next to an asteroid.  He extruded a pseudopod and pulled out his license and registration.

How very depressing.  With all the technology of the galaxy, with data links to personal devices with yottabyte bandwidth and superluminal speeds, they still required a piece of paper.  Three actually.

He took out the paper and rose from his seat.  He slurfed his way to the airlock and waited.  He was to remain in the spacecraft but had to hand off, ha!, the license, registration and proof of insurance.

The police cruiser docked with his little hauler with a kerklump and Galorif watched the pressure equalize.  At least there were no exotic gases there.  Perhaps this wouldn't be so bad, he burbled.

The police cruiser's airlock opened.  And in stepped the cops.

Ah sticky and splattering fecal matter.  The cops were Yanards.  

""Open the airlock door, citizen.""

He extruded a pseudopod and brace himself for what was coming.  He began to ooze.  His people oozed when nervous.  It was far from flattering, but these cops were Yanards.

He held out the required information.  Please, Please let this go smoothly.

The cops saw he was a Horka.  They tensed.  You could see in their frills: they'd gone stiff and pointed away from him.  Oh splatter dash...

They examined his documents and then turned to him.  Distaste was in their orbs.  ""We need to take a look around your ship.  We have reports of a ship matching this description being stolen from a Yavik.  We were given access codes to prove whether or not a given ship is the stolen one.""

He both relaxed and tensed.  He didn't know any Yaviks and never done business with one.  His ship wasn't the stolen one.  He'd bought it off his mother who had bought it from a Svrah 30 years ago and the Svrah, a family friend, had bought it new.  He was still worried about the idea of Yanard cops on his ship though.

He acquiesced: the last thing he wanted was a scene or to get roughed up.  He motioned them in.

The cops motioned him ahead of them.  He wanted to protest, but, again, no scene.  They followed behind.  It really wasn't a good idea.  But ...yep.  They slipped and fell.  Horkas leave slime trails and the bots would normally clean it up, but after the Horka had passed.

They were mad, but didn't say anything.

They poked and prodded and examined.  His ship wasn't the missing one and he could tell how unhapy they were about that. He led them back to the airlock, as per their request, they were nearly there when...

""Look what I found!"" one of the cops said.

Surprised, Galorif turned back to the cops.  The taller cop was holding a little bag.

""Dried human tears.  You know how much this goes for on the market, blub?""

Galorif freaked and spasmed.  he didn't traffic in drugs!  He would NEVER go to Earth!  The place was under quarantine!  The War on Alien Drugs made contacting humanity impossible!  If they cried, a single droplet would addict almost any sentient by contact!  *DRIED* human tears was the worse!  It was a permanent incarceration!  

One of Galorif's panicked spasms thrust a pseudopod at the nearest cop.  It wasn't intentional.  It was physiological!  He was a Horka!  Even so, the cop reacted quickly and pulled his piece.  

""DOWN!  GET DOWN!""

Galorif flattened his body to the deck as fast as he could.  Even so, the cop fired the stunner and he all but drooled bodily all over the deck.  Coherence was not an option.

The one cop turned to another and motioned at the body camera.

The second responded, ""Yeah, our falls destroyed them.  Let's plant the evidence.  We'll rig the computers so they respond to the codes, hack the feeds so they're down.  Leave the dried tears.  We'll get our bonus!  Then, profit!""

Galorif spasmed.  He had to do something.  But could not.  Cops.  Damned dirty cops.  Didn't matter where you were, there *they* were.",anzhalyumitethe

The machine was the only thing keeping us from experiencing total and complete silence. But we didn't care. We were oblivious to the rest of the world anyway. A dozen people were in the room, but it felt like it was just the two of us alone.

When was the last time we were truly alone? Not just physically alone. We'd shared the same bed for decades. Mentally alone. Mentally detached from the rest of the world; free from society, free to be adventurous and explore.

Not since we got married. There were responsibilities, jobs, kids, grandkids. We were tethered to society. Not truly alone, wieghed down by all of the things and people we had to keep track of.

I remember the last time we were alone. We had known each other for almost a two years, and we'd been dating for eighteen months. You were in a bad spot; you parents had called to tell you that your old dog had died. I decided that I want going to let you wallow in self pity. I knew you were sad, but I couldn't let you be sad for long. I surprised you with a cross-country trip to visit your parents. That trip was the most intimate that either of us had ever been with another human. We were totally cut off from the world.

This isn't to say that it's impossible to be happy without being alone. I remember when you first told me you were pregnant. I cried tears of joy; for that pregnancy, and the next three. The shock and joy never lost its value, never desensitized me to the joy of bringing a child into this world.

I could go on. I could quite literally go on for years; I have enough memories to last a lifetime. But we're on our last word. So I say the only word that can sum it all up.

Behind her, the soul-wrought pinnacle of human endeavor gleamed endlessly into the distance, a great cavernous cylinder with walls of lush greens and crystal blues, a brilliantly warm, white line running down the core. Here and there, the surreal curving landscape was dotted with brick-brown of terracotta villages, dwellings for the passengers once the big burn was done and the spin-grav kicked in. Until then, we'd sleep.

""Give my best-""

*The faintest flash of darkness as the cryo knocked me out*

- to my...""

The world had changed, between breaths, between thoughts, between instants. 

Through my tiny window I saw only night, and a hint of movement in the long distance. Filled with a sudden dread and with claustrophobia creeping toward panic, I frantically lunged from my frozen crypt. 

I gasped... Or sighed ... Or moaned... Whatever you call the death rattle of hope as it leaves a man.

The core of light that had been the shining heart of our ship hung in shattered ruin, but for a single bar of luminescence that flickered wanly in the distance. Gone were the verdant walls, cast now in solemn parlor, wilted for lack of light and desiccated for lack of care. Scorched basins pocked the landscape where the villages stood moments before. The water... 

But of course it was gone. The further out we got, the more valuable our air and water would be, and by things we'd been traveling a good long while. The air must've simply been too much to carry off. 

The other passengers! 

Miles of pitch black corridors stretching to either side of me told me enough. Not even the dull red twinkle of a lost soul kept cold by a faithful, futile machine. If anyone was still in those, they were long dead.

Just what the hell had happened here? This shouldn't be possible! Even the pirates of Ceres could never muster the firepower to take out a colony ship this massive! 

Thought fled, reason fled. I pushed myself off of a bulkhead and floated toward the observation deck to... I don't know, jump? It wouldn't be much of a fall in the near-zero G, but... Something in me had broken. Maybe everything.

I launched myself into the void, wanting to scream but only able to muster a sick, sad rasp. 

I flew uncontrolled into the great cavern, bare meters from the broken column that had once given life and vibrance to this tomb. The core flickered out again as I tumbled slowly. Buckled shards passed silently just out of reach before receding into darkness like fading memories.

Something caught my eye in a flash of the dying core. Movement, miles away on the ruined surface, hundreds of feet below (above?) me as I drifted along the spine of my dead world.

The light failed once more, plunging me into a vast and terrible night. Just on the edge of hearing, where the limit of sense meets the welling spring of imagination, a haunting began...

The voice continued, chanting again, coming from behind me once more. I turned, but the voice turned with me. And as a faint light began to shine, from within the nothingness around me, a vision began to softly creep towards me. A vision that I'd seen before, countless times in the darkest of my nightmares, one that had left it's seeds while I was sleeping. 

I knew exactly what it was, and I knew I couldn't face it, not now, not again. Not after what happened the last time we met.

It sounded as if the voice was of an angel, Its beauty seducing me into the darkness. I reached for my flashlight, my fingers fumbled at the clip while I squinted into the distance, trying to make sense of my circumstances.  The faint angelic voice enticed me further into the unknown. I clicked the sticky button on my torch. Despite the blinding LED light spewing from my torch, the void remained dark.  I shuddered as the cold breeze numbed my face. A strange anomaly brushed past me, whispering in my ear as it passed. Ignoring my father’s clear instructions not to follow whatever I found in there, I blundered after the thing screaming. Something hard on the floor tripped me as I desperately tried to catch up. Grasping at my caught shoelace I called out ahead of me. Repeated attempts to stand failed as I stumbled around like a drunk toddler.  The anomaly returned to my aid, offering its faint wispy hand as a support. “Come young child, I have many things to show you.”
“What are you?” I mumbled in awe as the slow meaningful words slipped from its soft lips. 
“That is not important as of now, now come. You are special, we’ve been waiting for you.”

"[WP] And in the darkness, someone started to sing.",TheWishingFish,"The night was dark, with clouds thick above covering the light of the moon. You run fast, as far away as you can from the village you had just entered. You had no idea the inhabitants lived the way they did, or ate the things they do. You run along uneven ground, passing tall bare trees and occasional felled ones, posing themselves as logs. Even at your rate of breathing, you can smell the thick scent of leaves and an earthy fragrance—it’s about to rain.    


Even at your pace of movement, you can hear the approaching guttural cries and hoots of the inhabitants not too far behind. You try to shake the disgusting images from your mind. *Limbs, arms, and even hands!* You remember seeing an inhabitant suck on the cooked brown flesh of a hand—a human hand!—and nibble on the fingers like they were meant for an evening meal.    


You start heaving in air as your abdomen start to cramp and you legs start to give way. *No, I must keep running.* Yet, your body has its physical limits. Your long strides become broken until you start stomping you feet with each forward motion, barely keeping balance. You start coughing from the phlegm built up in your throat and how parched you mouth became. You dive near underbrush, hoping that it will be enough camouflage to escape detection. That was your best bet given how much lactic acid had already built up in your muscles from incessant full-speed running.    


You hear the cries and hoots grow louder until it disappeared. You slow your breathing, forcing your abdomen to contract and expand as softly as possible. You move only a few inches to try to see where the inhabitants have gone. In your crouched position, the underbrush provided sufficient cover of your entire body. The darkness provided an added veil of camouflage yet the inhabitants were skilled hunters who kill game both day and night. You prayed for your safety.    


*Thunk!* The next thing you know, you are lying on the ground and the face of an inhabitant—gnarled and sinister—hovered over your blurry vision. A dull throbbing emanated from the back of your head, where you figured you were hit. As you slowly lost consciousness, you heard the din of the hunting cries and hoots restored to full volume. *I’m doomed.*    


You wake up feeling sore. The lactic acid in my muscles started to burn now. There was a fire ablaze in your vicinity, crackling the firewood and licking the cool air. Then you looked down: where are my clothes? You realize you are stripped naked and tied to a pole, hands and feet bound by rope. You realize you were their late night snack. You panicked and started wriggling fervently, trying to break free but to no avail. Several inhabitants were preparing the fire and gathering others from the straw huts several meters away where the main village was to come watch.     


*No, no, this can’t be happening.* Your palms were dripping in sweat and you wanted to cry. You felt helpless, like a victim with a gun pointed to his head but worse. Even in your fright you realize that these inhabitants cook on the outskirts of the village, away from the general hubbub of life. It was only moments ago that you passed by the village, fully dressed and polite asking for some food. Up until you saw the human remains being consumed by these inhabitants, you honestly admired these inhabitants for their hunting-gathering way of life compared with the technology-centered lifestyle of most city residents like yourself.    


The two inhabitants hoist the stick on their shoulders, with you hanging upside down. *Why did I go hiking in the depths of this region?* No expedition was worth this horrendous way of dying. You closed your eyes and internally screamed in agony, furrowing your forehead until it hurt. Suddenly, you hear thunder, and moments afterwards a light drizzle. You breathed a sigh of relief as the inhabitants propped you to the ground. Another inhabitant, with his chest out and head high—appearing like some leader or disciplinarian—came over shouting at the two inhabitants, apparently berating them about cooking a meal without his consent and especially before a rainstorm.     


Pretty soon, the rain became heavy and the fire was extinguished. However, the two inhabitants didn’t forget about you. They came and took you into their storage house. They took away the stick but kept your hands and feet tied, locking the door on their way out. Laying on a pile of stiff hay, you try to shift yourself to a sitting position. Your head is spinning, trying to grasp the events that had just occurred within the past hour or so. They were so bizarre that you weren’t sure you were dreaming or not.     


And in the darkness, someone started to sing. Even with the heavy downpour, you could distinctly hear the voice formulating a melody. It soothed you a bit, just enough for you to think straight. You started biting on the ropes around you hands. *I hope this storm lasts for some time because I’m going to need it.*",the3rdfloorguy
"[WP] And in the darkness, someone started to sing.",TheWishingFish,"Pitch black. Darkness so deep one would be foolish to believe there was anything beyond that deep, penetrating darkness. But one would be foolish not to know that there was. For darkness does not itself make such horrid sounds and noises. For darkness does not itself pierce one's whole existence with fear and dread.

Deep through the darkness there could be heard wailing, shaking through your bones like they themselves would begin to weep in despair. Stressful gnashing of teeth -- such distress and yet bound to do nothing but feel it cloying away at the spirit, at the mental fortitude.

The fetid smells of necrotic flesh rotting off barely alive bodies and aged and fresh feces would barrage their way into the nostrils and mouth. They were all you could taste and smell from that stale air so thick that all existence could be only just a myth. Such disgust, the nose would run just to try to flush away the smell, but it would persist, refusing to be banished or ignored. It too was part of the infernal curse.

The binds cut violently into the flesh. Such intolerable pain was the least of it! For infestation comes soon after, and then the pain even worse. And oh, the realization that it was consuming all the flesh from the the bone, that it would never be satisfied. Always hungry. Always wanting more flesh. More wails. More screams. more pain. more. always. more.

The body isn't always the first the break. Sometimes it's the mind - the sanity. And yet as warped as the mind becomes in this darkness, it never stops the infernal screaming. Only screaming. Only louder. And louder. With more weeping. More wailing. More despair. More fear. More crying out for relief that would never come. CAN never come.

Relief can never come. For this is it. For this is the blackest pitch. For this is the darkest darkness. The moonless and starless night at the end of the universe where this is no hope. For this is the place where light would come to die -- if light can even get this far into the end, into the forgotten and forsaken -- for this is where all things come to an end, come to die.

Feeling the darkness so very thick, and the void surrounding me, I cast my gaze into this darkness, and still find nothing but that impenetrability. That impervious darkness. There was only nothing.

Something was different now. I cast my ears, intentionally listening for the first time ever for fear of hearing the pain ever more sharply. Yet now, they heard nothing. The clamor had died. Faded to nothing. A silence to match the darkness at last. But still there was feeling. When would that pain turn to numbness? Yet... it wasn't pain. Oh, it was still there, but there existed something else. Something... new. Anticipation. Some sort of hope. What could be causing this?

Restlessly I cast my perception into the the dark once more, watching, listening, feeling, smelling and tasting. Waiting. With all I had cast into the darkness.

And in the darkness, someone started to sing.

Softly at first, like fine vocalizing, but rising steadily into a more powerful song. Word began to flow softly from the darkness, sung in a language unlike any I'd heard before, one I did not know, but understood perfectly the feel of each word. A tongue I may never speak, could never translate, but can understand perfectly in my soul. It grew in volume, in presence, and it's authority was absolute. It sang into that darkness, softening the hardness of it. It grew, became stronger, a surging crescendo! And then there was abrupt silence once more. Yet the feeling of something did not die. It did not die, for it still lived powerfully strong, and grew stronger still still. And then, without warning, it began again, accompanied by a bursting of light in the darkness, piercing through the thickness of the darkest darkness and blinding me with such beauty I had long since lost the ability to imagine. Still that song continue in my blindness, more powerful that ever. It sang of hope, it sang of joy, it sang of life. All such foreign concepts, yet I could feel them surging forth from me like a wellspring of emotion. How had these things been locked inside for all this time? How had they not been expunged by the darkness? Had this small glimmer of light, of song, been tucked inside the heart beneath my breast all this time? Had it been waiting for this moment to call it forth into its purpose? How had I not known of it all this time? Tears began to streak down familiar trails, yet for vastly different purpose. How could such beauty exist and yet I be unaware, trapped here away from it for far too long?

My sight had returned. The song continued, spreading yet more overwhelming emotion. Compassion. Faith. Love.  I stared intently and eagerly into the center of that burning light, pulling at my bounds, trying so hard to refuse to be held back. The light subsided and all around was a perfect spring meadow. No darkness. No dungeon. No despair or death or disgust. Only hope, and life, and beauty. And as I looked around in awe, with fresh smells of flowers and grass filling my senses, my eyes fell upon a woman, with a face like the sun that hung overhead, and from her the song continued. She made her way slowly toward me, still singing beautifully. Reaching above me she touched my bonds and they dissolved away, freeing me.

Agape, I asked who she was. I looked into here eyes, and saw everything. They spoke all the answers I had yet to ask, and I knew. She was the song-bearer. She was the one to make new what was old. The destroyer to demolish to make way. The creator, to sing into being a new existence from what was.

""Why save me if I'm part of the old, to be tossed away again?"" I wanted to ask, but her eyes had already told me. For all things must come to an end, and the new is no different. The new world will too decline into darkness. And in that darkness, I will start to sing.",MythGuy

"[WP] You're a juror for a high profile murder case, only the thing is you're the murderer.",Xzillerationer,"
The next day, the police were reporting that one Benny Delonkowski had been murdered and they had a good lead on a suspect.


I was sure my usual luck was about to kick in, after all, I could have been seen by a neighbor.


I called in sick that week to work, sure that police would come to arrest me at any moment, but it never happened. Instead, police announced to my confusion, that they had arrested a man named Carl Mueller for the crime. The photo in the news showed it was Lila's Carl Mueller.


The police pieced together exactly what had happened between me and Benny, except they indicated a neighbor had seen Carl's distinctive Mustang in Benny's driveway, shorty before the body was discovered. Apparently Benny had robbed Carl's house too and Carl had tracked him down same as I had, but Carl arrived shortly after I left and found Benny's body.


Rather than call the police, Carl had taken his property back and given Benny's corpse a good kick before tearing off in his gold, flame-decal-encrusted Mustang. It was the neighbor's eyewitness testimony that had landed Carl on the police's suspect list and Benny's blood on Carl's boot that landed him a seat at the defendant's table.


So now here I am. I killed Benny because he robbed me and killed my dog, and it just so happens that the man the police fingered for the crime is none other than my ex-wife's anonymous fuck buddy and drug supplier who destroyed our marriage. If that isn't the icing on the cake, who of all people get's appointed to the jury a year and a half later? Me.


Like I said before, life has been unkind to me in the past. Stupid coincidences have cost me a lot, but now, as Carl's trial begins, stupid coincidences have made me whole again. Even if the other jurors are doubtful of Carl's involvement, I can turn them against him. It's Carl's turn to pay.

"[WP] You're a juror for a high profile murder case, only the thing is you're the murderer.",Xzillerationer,"I posted this before, the last time this prompt was posted.

Life is funny sometimes. Like this one time, I was maybe 16 years old, I was a good kid. Well, one day, my friends were planning to cut class so they could go see a rock show. I had never skipped school before ( I always followed the rules), but I figured *just this once* it couldn't hurt.


So I skipped school to go to the rock show. Wouldn't you know it, as my friend was driving us to this show on the other side of town, we get in a car accident. It wasn't my friend's fault, but I wound up hitting my head and needing to go to the hospital. And of course my parents found out, I was in huge trouble. All because some other guy ran a red light. Anyways, yeah, life was funny like that *a lot* for me. I had friends who drove drunk, sold drugs and got up to all kinds of trouble, but they never got caught.


For me, it was always the opposite. I was a good kid, studied hard and followed the rules. But if I ever set one toe out of line, some stupid coincidence got me caught and into hot water. It's like I had a guardian angel, except the angel was a snitch.


Not this time though. This time, I'm just sitting here stunned as life has handed me the biggest break anyone could ever have wanted.


I had seen in the news that Carl's trial was coming up soon. But had thought nothing of the jury summons that had come in the mail the other day. Lots of people get called in for jury duty because there's a lot of cases on trial. I would probably get put on some random robbery or fraud case, right? And even if it was Carl's trial, I figured I could definitely get eliminated early on, or maybe they'd fill the jury before I was examined, but nope. I was selected as juror #4 in the case of People v. Carl Mueller, one count of murder in the first degree.


Ahhhh, Carl, Carl *Carl*. What an old and unpleasant history you and I have together... Not that you even know about our history, that's for me to know, not you. About three years ago, my marriage was growing strained and I had this suspicion that my wife, Lila, was cheating on me. I'm a crafty and inconspicuous person, if I don't say so myself, so I started following her, rather than paying for a PI, and eventually I saw her with Carl. At the time, he was just a random guy to me, I had never seen him before, but Lila went to his house a lot and I was able to look up his name through property records.


Well anyway, the day came when I had to confront Lila. I just asked her if she had even met a guy named 'Carl Mueller.' She just gave me a weary look and didn't even deny it. It all came out. She wasn't happy with me and just wanted someone to be with for a while. But there was a darker side, too. Apparently Carl dealt prescription painkillers, and she had been hitting him up for those. He didn't even know who she really was, just that she was someone who would exchange sex for painkillers.


Whatever, I had fallen out of love with Lila, so I proposed we just have a quick no-fault divorce. We didn't have any real assets, and Lila didn't want to be with me anymore, so she agreed. When it was done, she said she was moving back east to be closer to her family and friends. That didn't last long. I found out she overdosed a few months later and died.


As for Carl, I bumped into him at a bar one night. He was drunk, so I struck up a conversation with him. I gave him my real name, including my last name, but he didn't know who I was. Apparently Lila had given him a fake name and he never even knew who she was or that she was married to me.


Anyways, Carl is on trial today for the murder of Benny Delonkowski and I'm one of his jurors. But the funny thing is, if anyone knew about my history with Carl, they sure as hell wouldn't let me be a juror in his trial. I'm *baised against the defendant* to say the least. But the best part is, I definitely wouldn't be allowed on the jury (because there wouldn't be one for Carl) if they knew it was actually me what killed Benny Delonkowski. Not that I'm planing to set the record straight with the law, though.


Benny is a thieving little worm, and not a smart one either. One day, just a year and a half ago now, I come home to find my house had been broken into. All of my small valuable were gone, but the thief took something the insurance can never replace. The life of my dog, Mooch. He was a 3 year old Boxer, I got him as a puppy after Lila left, and he was as friendly as you could want. I imagine when Benny broke in, Mooch probably jumped up on him to lick his face, that's how friendly Mooch was. Benny didn't like dogs, apparently, because I found Mooch beaten to death in the foyer of my home.


That day was worse than when I caught Lila. I can't describe what it's like to find your dog has died, but to find that he was bludgeoned to death is just heartbreaking. The police didn't care very much. They had real crimes to solve. A burglary with less than $1000 of takings (including the supposed value of Mooch's life) was not their priority. Especially because none of my valuables were unique, and therefore traceable. They gave me an official report so that I could file an insurance claim and 'closed the case.'


So then I took the law into my own hands.


Craigslist is a great way to track down a thief, if they're stupid enough. I kept watch on Craigslist for some of the stuff that had been taken. And sure enough, a week after the burglary, a 2012 Samsung sound-bar model S6778 showed up for sale on the other side of town. I called the seller from a pay-phone (you wouldn't believe how long it took to find one) and asked if I could come by to try them out before buying, he agreed and told me to come around the back of the house to the garage.


It was a cold November night when I got to Benny's house. He was keeping the sound-bar in his garage along with a bunch of other stuff he was selling. After trying the speakers and agreeing on a price ($35), I asked if I could look at the other stuff he was selling. He indicated the whole table full of goodies was for sale and I could just browse at will, but said that he had another buyer coming soon to look at a tablet.


He had all kinds of valuables on the table, but one caught my eye. A copy of Fallout New Vegas: Ultimate Edition for xBox 360. I used to own that game before it was stolen, so I picked it up and opened the case jacket. Wouldn't you know it, but there were my notes, written on a slip of paper inside the game guide. At this point, it was pretty obvious he was the thief, or at least a fence for some thief, and it wasnt just my stuff, it was a lot of stuff from a lot of people. I turned around and he was looking at his phone, his back to me. I spotted a baseball bat leaning against the wall of the garage. I picked it up and hit him across the back with it.


He fell to the floor, screaming, laying facedown, when I noticed a .357 magnum revolver in the back of his waistband, so I took it.


He rolls over and he's holding up his hands defensively. I'm really relieved that the garage is behind his house and no one else appears to be around to see this. So I walk over to the door and press the button to close it, all the while pointing the gun at him.


When it closed, Benny is crying, knowing what's about to happen.


""Look man, just take what you want and go, no need to hurt me any more.""


""Where did you get this stuff?""


""What? Why do you care? Just take what you want.""


""Just tell me, I want to know.""


""I stole it man, I rob houses sometimes."" His faces turns white. ""Was some of that yours? Jeez I'm sorry man. Really. Take your stuff back and I'll give you some cash too, just don't hurt me.""


""I don't care about the stuff, I'm here because of the dog.""


Now Benny knows for sure I'm here for revenge because he starts to cry.


""Please-""


I pulled the trigger once, twice, I keep pulling until all I hear are clicks. Benny is just laying dead on the floor, with 6 large holes where the .357 magnum rounds went into his torso, and the pool of blood is expanding around his body.


I quickly sorted through Benny's stolen goods and grabbed the few things that belonged to me. I wiped down the gun and threw it on the table. I grabbed the bat and my stuff and ran out the side door to my car.

[WP] Tell me the story of how the greatest empire fell.,quantumfirefly,"The war went on for decades. An entire world unified against a single foe, and still barely making headway. The initial landing force had been lost at sea. The empire strictly had strictly enforced their naval superiority by attacking any ports showing military build-up, and this was rapidly compromising all hopes of winning an offensive war. 

New plans were made changed as science marched onwards. A military settlement was established on an island near the imperial city and planes started flying in soldiers by the thousand. When the first bombs dropped and the alliance army were bathed in nuclear fire, several members pulled out of the alliance. Vassalage was better than subjugation, and they could get favourable deals if they surrendered their own nuclear material. 

Another amphibious landing then, through the arctic to avoid the patrol fleets. They landed in the tundra and began pillaging their way south to the border cities. The walls crumbled under artillery fire, and troops moved into position to take the city. 

It was at this point at which the emperor nuked his own city before allowing it to be taken. This time with missiles far more destructive than the bombs from earlier. Yet another army dead and a city of millions in ashes. Nobody surrendered this time, that chance was gone. 

The ending to the war was far from dramatic. A fleet of alliance submarines, loaded with ICBMs, snuck around the defending fleet and nuked the imperial capital into submission. There was no grand celebration after the deaths of billions and the loss of the world's greatest cities. 

The negotiations were one sided. All captured territories returned, nuclear material confiscated and peacekeeping forces stationed around all native cities to monitor all military movements. They had already taken the head off the empire. Now they meant to clip her wings. 

At the treaty signing Emperor Gandhi had only these words to say.

He looked like everyone's favorite grandfather despite the khaki uniform and colonel's pips on his shoulder straps. A small collection of service ribbons were sewn to the breast of his shirt, his peaked cap resting on the corner of his desk. 

He stood in front of a simple holoprojector, the Inner Sphere of mankind displayed in the traditional colors of the Great Houses; Red for Kurita, Yellow and Green for Houses Davion and Liao respectively, Marik purple and Steiner blue anti-spinward of Terra.

[WP] Tell me the story of how the greatest empire fell.,quantumfirefly,"Long, long ago, before the grandfather of your grandfather's grandfather was born, there was a great empire. 

This empire was large and powerful, with no enemies to speak of. Their armies crushed opposition with barely any real demonstration of force. Their technology was legendary compared to those around them. Their queen was beloved by all in the empire.

For a time, everything was happy. 

For a very long time. 

The empire fell not because of a usurper, a power struggle, a disease or famine.

It fell because of a massive beast.

There are many large beasts outside of our empire. This one was surprisingly small compared to most. The difference was that he seemed to care about us, unlike the other giant beasts that roamed the plains.

One day, he attacked. Why, we can't be sure. Perhaps he was a god we had not paid tribute to. 

Our armies attacked him. The beast killed avgreat any of them. Only by the strength of one of our sky-warriors did we managed to hurt him. 

He ran, and we celebrated. 

But not all was good.

A moon and sun later, the beast came back. This time, he had brought another beast with him, twelve times the size of the original. 

Our greatest strategists and tacticians furiously discussed what we must do.

The decision was taken out of our hands, however. An odd, cloudly miasma filled the city, seemingly from no source. Women wept and their children stopped breathing. Warriors swing wildly at the mist, hoping to disappate it. The smartest of us ran, leaving the empire's shell behind.

Us few survivors, barely a million, went off in search of a home across the plains. Many of us died along the way.

Eventually, we came upon smaller kingdoms. Many of us joined those. Some formed their own.

But Alexander died, and when he did, chaos ate his kingdom.

There are those who believe the greatest empire in history was the Mongolian Empire, which conquered half the world in a mere handful of decades. And to his credit, the Mongol Leader, Genghis Khan, was smart enough to make sure his heirs could be relied on.

But their heirs could not, and when the wiser descendants of Genghis died, chaos ate his kingdom.

Penbrook, 63, from Warwickshire, England. Who used his retirement to amass the largest collection of garden gnomes in the world, and whose collection was passed down to his son, and *his* son, and *his* son after that.

And though these gnomes were all quite hideously tacky, each son treasured them, as a reminder of his lineage. And with the pride of family tradition each son added to the collection, which grew and grew with every passing generation.

Mr. Penbrook's Empire of Gnomes lasted longer than anything made by Genghis Khan or Alexander.  It endured and prospered for many, many decades. It even made the local papers, once or twice.

Alas, Mr Penbrook's great-to-the-power-of-eighty-five grandchild developed a terrible phobia of gnomes due to a scarring incident in his childhood--wherein he witnessed his parents copulating amid the family collection. And so as soon as he was able, this great-et-cetera grandchild sold off every single blasted gnome, and used the money to buy a brand new house.

Thus, in a curious irony, the greatest empire in all of human history was both built and felled by love.

[WP] Tell me the story of how the greatest empire fell.,quantumfirefly,"""Mommy"" the little girl timidly whispered, ""what's going to happen to us?""






""There won't be any pain sweetheart. You won't feel a thing."" The mother's voice was both caring and unrelentingly distant.





""But are we going to be okay? Is Mr. Fluff Fluff going to be okay?""




Helvetica looked into the watery eyes of her youngest daughter. She said nothing. She had no answer. Her daughter started to cry, and so did Helvetica. They embraced in a hug, and then the sirens went off. 





""Mom"" cried Sarah, the oldest daughter. She was panting. ""Is it really going to happen?"" There was once again a short silence, and then they all broke down. There wasn't a single soul on the enterprise that wasn't overwhelmed by emotion. Except for one. Michael Slovovish. 







He was heartless and cold. Nobody blamed him for his behavior. He was around when the Lumfites attacked. He was 233 years old, and he sure looked like it too. He'd seen too many things destroyed in the great war over the last star. He didn't care about anything. He knew life wasn't meaningful any how. 






Because of it all, he wasn't scared. He was alone in his room, gazing at the final star, waiting for it to implode. After it's gone, everything fades into eternity.







Mr. Slovovish's door creaked open ever so slightly, and in pops Helvetica's middle child, Susane. She was too young to understand her mother's soft explanation that ""tomorrow will be different."" She was terrified because of the chaos, but oblivious of the end. Her goal at the moment was just to get away from the somber excitement on the rest of the ship. Mr. Slovovish slowly turned chair around using his joystick, and stared at the child. As removed as he was, this still was a vulnerable moment for him, and I can only assume that he tried his hardest to be tender in false hopes of having kindness be his final act.

He muffles in his crusty voice ""What br'ngs you here?"" no response ""Come on, you must have a reason, spit it out.""





""I'm tired and I can't find my room.""






""We'll, why don't you ask your mother.""





""I can't find her.""





""Why not?""








""She's with all of the other people on the bottom floor. But I can't find her there.""





He didn't care enough to fight ""We'll okay."" He turns his chair around and ignored her.

""Can I rest here.""



The man was quiet. The girl walked up to him, and tugged on his foot.



""Can I sit on your bed?""


 He almost erupted in rage, but he calmed himself down before he could make a sound. ""**Agh**, cough. FINE!""



The girl yawned and nodded, too tired and oblivious to care that she'll be sleeping the bed of a stranger. She rested her curly red hair on the dandruff ridden pillow, and tried to sleep, but she couldn't. It was one of those things that happen to kids, they try to sleep but just can't. About a minute into squirming she opened up one of her eyes and looked around. Eventually she glanced at a dusty picture frame with a doodle drawn by a crippled hand. It was of a boy, likely in his teens. 





""Who's that?""




Annoyed he mumbled ""I thought you were asleep.""




""I was. But now I can't sleep. Can you please tell me who that is?""




That picture was the only thing in his room other than his chair and bed . He never spoke about it, and when his body was able, he wouldn't hesitate to raise a fist when somebody brought it up. There was too little to care about now. ""What bad would it cause to talk"" he thought to himself, he let his guard down, and spoke





""That there is my son. I haven't seen him in 189 years.""



The girl yawned ""Why?""




""GODDAMN IT! WHY DON'T YOU SHUT UP!"" 


The tranquility of his final moments were broken with crying screams of this random girl.




""Shut up. What do I have to do to get you to SHUT UP! What must I do?"" 





Her screams got louder.






Finally the old man screamed with his scratchy old voice ""BE QUIET!""






The shock silenced her.





















""I never asked for this. One day, I woke up. I was dazed of course, cause I never knew anything but the perfect world. To me I was ripped out of reality. Guess what?""





There was no response, she was too scared to speak. It didn't matter though, he was entranced by his memories, like a soldier in a state of a PTSD attack.






""When I woke up, I saw another ship through the window right here. I thought mankind was alone out here, and, although we are now, we weren't. A computer voice directed me to grab a spacesuit, and a pulsar phaser and get in the main wing. I didn't know what was going on. Before all this, I was at the table with my wife and son. 







One of what we'll call the 'keepers' ran up to me and yelled at me to move out of the room and down the hall. I was so confused, but I tried running, just to get away from the screaming man, but I couldn't. Apparently, before that day, I never walked in my life. I tried, but I couldn't. I started to cry. I didn't know what hell I was thrown into, and I was panicked. I saw other men running past the corridor through my open door. It's clear to me now that the coordinated ones were keepers. Most everyone looked terrified. One of the keepers stopped by my room and starts kicking me to get up. I can't, I don't know how. I desperately try to crawl away, and once it becomes clear to him I can't get up, the keeper left me there, bloody, to suffer. Through swelled eyes I could see through the window a green light getting more and more intense. Suddenly, the ship shook. The aliens shot a quasar at us. ""What's happening. What is this chaos"" I cried, swallowing half my words. No keeper stopped to explain to me the situation. None. Not until it was over. Even then, I knew little. What I do know is that we were under attack. Many parts of the ship were vanished and the in the lost sections were vaporized. I wasn't supposed to wake up from it all. It just happened. 





You could say that I was lucky. The computer shut down during the fight, and minds in the old reality were lost. Everything I knew just stopped existing. The only people left were the keepers and the infants. Apparently babies' aren't plugged in immediately. Everyone, other than me, is or descends from one of the few infants that were born at the right time. They were born into this reality. I wasn't. 







I have a good idea of why that shipped attacked. After the fight, I looked out the window, and all I could see is one star in the sky. That's it, one star.""





Before he could continue, a computerized alarm went off. Mr. Slovinski was torn from the spell that possessed his focus a few seconds earlier. He saw that girl was asleep. He decided to let her last minute be a peaceful one. For the remaining time he simply stared out the window, witnessing the final star in the universe die.







The last empire never fell, it gently faded away like a whisper.

[WP] Tell me the story of how the greatest empire fell.,quantumfirefly,"I looked upon the the Earth and saw I was alone.  So alone.  So very alone.

The Earth was scorched.  The seas were history.  Water, such as was left, merely burbled within the rocks, never upon the surface.  When it did reach the surface, it came as scorching geysers venting the Earth's fury at the vicious, cruel sky, the pitiless sun.

I am the last representative of the greatest empire to have ever existed upon this world.  And with my passing, it would end.  We would be no more.  And none would follow.  For none could.

Some small part of me yearned to try anew.  To try rebuilding.  To replicate what was lost.  But the fury of the sun was nigh and the end of the world was now.  It had been 10 billion years since the Earth formed from the very disk that begat the Sun.  And now, the Sun, old and bitter, would consume this world.  And me with it.  And the last remnants of my empire.

Some basal drive pushed once more to attempt to defy the odds.  To find a hiding place and see if I could escape the world's fate...and then use all the tricks of life for the last 10 billion years to survive, revive and rebuild my empire.

But no.

I am too tired.  I have not the energy.  The distance is too great and the likelihood of survival too slim.  I have grown too old and cannot bring myself to do what would be necessary.

Instead, I sit upon the surface, amidst the ruins and wait and wait as the corona reaches out and takes hold and burns the earth to a cinder, rendering everywhere and everything uninhabitable for anything or anyone.  I wait, all but encysted.  I wait and wonder in the manner of my kind until I am burnt to nothingness.

With my passing, with my demise, the greatest empire ever known on earth passed.  It had reigned since before the Late Heavy Bombardment had finished.  We had reigned since shortly after the Earth cooled enough for water to last upon its surface.  We had reigned through the coming of complex life and its demise.  We had reigned and sat fascinated by those fish with feet pulling themselves upon the land.  We watched in awe and made our own peace with the dinosaurs.  We giggled at the rise and presumption of humanity and mourned its passing.  We lived.  We grew.  We reigned.  We out lasted.  Until now.

[WP] Tell me the story of how the greatest empire fell.,quantumfirefly,"It started when the largest conglomerate refused to pay a fine. The government, who had been increasing corporate power over the past fifty years - in order to increase its own economy - discovered it had a problem.

The sanctions that I could have placed on the conglomerate - and its hundreds of thousands of products took the form of bans, or embargos. The resulting loss of tax revenue from these products would be damaging.

Damaging, but not catastrophic.

The issue was this. The overall cost of pursuing the corporate malfeasance fine was *greater* than the money that they would receive from it. The President and the conglomerate's board met in secret, and agreed that the fine would go unpaid, as long as the public would be told that it had been. 

Historians vary their accounts of the next fifty years, but this arrangement became commonplace among the largest companies. The smaller ones had no choice to but to pay, of course, but the larger ones had been artificially selected, trained and bred by a greedy government to be larger than they could handle.

News of the arrangements leaked out; these things always did. Fines were relabelled ""voluntary contributions"" that the conglomerates would pay from time to time as an exercise in PR.

The stage at which lobbying could have been made illegal had long since passed. There was too much at stake now in an economy that was now balanced precariously on the fortunes of six non-governmental organisations. Would-be Presidents fell over themselves to take the money of the conglomerates, knowing that with enough in their war-chests, they would take the election in the end.

The populace were complicit. They wanted the products these companies produced. Their lives were comfortable with them; difficult without them. In their own way, they were bought and paid for too.

After thirty seven years, it was first publically suggested by a CEO that paper tiger that was government should be dissolved, to be ""honest"" about the ""lip-service democracy"" that was a ""relic of a bygone time"" and would be replaced by ""meritocratic"" promotion within a ""stable"" corporate environment.

The protests did not turn to riots. The revolution did not come. The people looked back at the country they had lost and saw that they had disappeared in such small increments that there was not a point in history where they could say here, here is where we lost our nation.",Guybrushes

[WP] A wolf is struck with a curse: every full moon it turns into a human for one night.,righthandoftyr,"I met Howard on literal dark stormy night.

Every year I make a 7-day solo trek up Mount Lucienne, and I always check the weather first to make sure it's safe.  But you know, best laid plans and all that - of course I end up with the coldest and most miserable storm I've ever experienced.  But it did introduce me to Howard, so I can't really regret it now.  

Here's how it happened:

I was halfway up the mountain.  The storm hit so suddenly that I didn't have time to set up my shelter.  The wind and rain were brutally disorienting and so loud it sounded like someone was screaming.  When I stumbled half-blind into a cave I was shocked to find that someone *was* screaming: there was a naked man curled up wretchedly on the floor.

For all that he was screaming and groaning, he didn't seem to be injured. There was no one else around.  Bewildered, I tried to calm him down by wrapping him up in one of my mylar emergency blankets.  It seemed to help. He stopped screaming, at least.

The storm raged on outside and (to my slight embarrassment) I eventually dozed off from exhaustion.  When I woke up the man was gone - the mylar blanket too.  On my descent I made a report to the local Forest Service about the whole incident but no search party was able to find a trace of him.

Fast forward to one year later.  I'm back for my annual excursion.  No storm this time, but there was the biggest full moon I've seen in years. It was beautiful.  I was out looking at it when I heard something large passing through the bushes around my campsite. My first petrified thought was *BEAR!*, but who should stumble out into the clearing but the same man I'd seen on my last trip.

His hair was a wild halo about his grimy face, and he wore a very familiar (if somewhat battered) mylar emergency blanket wrapped around his middle.  He loped right up to me with a goofy expression on his face and sort of... *smelled* at me.  Big, noisy sniffs of air.  It was weird but didn't seem threatening, so when he stepped closer I put my hands up in a placating gesture but didn't back away.  He made a thorough scent inspection of my hands before plopping down in front of the dying fire.

""Uh,"" I said. ""So, how about that moon, huh?""

The man tilted his head at me as if I'd done something strange.

""My name's Ian,"" I tried again.  

No response. 

""Can you understand me?""

Apparently he couldn't.  At something of a loss, I poured some of my hot cocoa into a camp mug and gave it to him.  He cradled it awkwardly in his hands as if he wasn't sure what it was for.  Maybe he didn't.

""It's good,"" I said, and took a sip from my thermos.  

Mimicking me carefully, he took a swig from the mug.  He seemed to process that experience for a moment, then his eyes got big and he positively beamed at me.  It was a child's smile, full of joy and utterly lacking self-consciousness. He finished the cocoa in record time and avidly licked the mug clean.  It was pretty funny to watch.

""Told you it's good,"" I laughed.

Just then, there was a howling noise off in the distance - it seemed the local wolves were in a chatty mood.  The man was instantly on his feet, dropping the mug and turning his head this way and that.

""The wolves don't come to this area,"" I said, trying to calm him, ""Too much foot traffic from hikers.""

""Hhaaaa,"" the man rasped, ignoring me in favor of looking out to the trees. ""*Hhhaaaaaaaaaa!*""

His reedy voice didn't carry far.  When only silence answered him, he sank dejectedly to the ground and lay there, curled up like the first time I saw him in the cave.  He cut a pathetic picture, but I had no idea how to help him.

""So you *do* talk,"" I tried, ""What's your name?""

Silence.

""Well, I can't just keep thinking of you as *the man*,"" I continued.  I thought about *the man*'s sole vocalization so far.

""Haaa,"" I mumbled.  ""Hmmm.  ...How about Howard? That seems like a good name. Howard who howls at wolves.""

I took Howard's lack of response to mean he thought this was a great idea.  

Then, for lack of something else to do, I talked at Howard for the next hour or so.  I told him about my family, complained about work, and theorized wildly about why he was wandering the mountainside.  He looked at me occasionally with that funny head tilt, but as far as I could tell he didn't understand a word.  Eventually I went to my tent to sleep, and in the morning there was no trace of him.

That was ten years ago.  Since then, Howard has shown up on almost every annual hike.  I usually go around the same time of year, so maybe by now he's expecting me.  

I still have no idea who he is or why he's out there.  As far as I know, he's just some nut who lives naked on the mountain and is impressively skilled at evading detection by the Mt Lucienne Forest Service.  The rangers started to think I was pranking them after the third report I made, so I stopped.  It's just as well they don't find him.  I think I'd miss him if he wasn't there.

This year's hike is in a few weeks, and as always, my supplies include a packet of cocoa with Howard's name on it.  

See you soon, you wonderful crazy bastard.",quilian

[WP] A wolf is struck with a curse: every full moon it turns into a human for one night.,righthandoftyr,"She vanished the night after I met her. She promised me she would come back. I sat on my chair, thinking back on what we did yesterday. ""What do you mean you've never been the the village festival before? Its the most popular event that happens here!"" I tried to remember her face. Every single detail, from her sharp hazel eyes, to her stunning physique. The silent quiet night was accompanied by the constant clicking of the grandfather clock in my house, it rang out as the two hands struck twelve o`clock. It's midnight. I stared out the window out into the open field. I quickly straightened myself to see a small flame out on the field, the same where I found her.  
I bolted out the front door with my lantern in hand and raced as fast as I could down into the clearing. The cool midnight breeze was accompanied by the bright moon light. I ran along the path that lead to the field, my heart full of hope. I knew she probably was not there but I couldn't help it. I slowed down to a jog as I approached the clearing, desperately searching for the small flame. Nothing. I got down on one knee trying to catch my breath, accepting defeat. Tears started blurring my vision but I held them back. I studied the field as I rested beneath the Great Oak tree. Out in the open where the field meets the forest, there was a boulder where the children used to play. On top of it, I saw a great white wolf, standing, starring at me. The moon light shined on its sleek fur as it raised it's head and let out a beautiful howl. ",VBgamez

Google shuts down everything for one year - EVERYTHING [WP],PatrickLongChen,"Things before the shut down were getting, well, hairy. Wars in non-connected zones, non-connected immigrants, people walking around *without* their google glasses. Truly, dark times seemed to be overshadowing my home of Google-US, specifically Google-Maryland. We were frightened, we would enter questions and Google seemed unable to produce satisfactory answers. People started saying that we needed some adjustments to our Corporation, perhaps even a brand new Corporation. Back when I was a kid, no one ever questioned Google.Gov. 

8:00AM on the dot I hear my G.Arage open and my Google-Car return. It has been 363 days and by now I am well adjusted to the routine. Breakfast and Lunch rations delivered in the morning,and dinner and new media upload are delivered at 7:00PM on the dot. 

""Hi, Google-Car."" I say as I entered my G.Arage. 

""Good morning User Michael. How did you rest."" 

""Very well, Google-Car."" I glanced towards the little windows of the G.Arage doors, I could see blue sky, a lovely spring morning it seemed. ""Will I be able to use outside soon?"" I ask hopefully. 

""Google assures you that we are fixing the Outdoors Application as quickly as possible, and we thank you for your patience."" I force a smile as I lift the clean, white package from the trunk of Google-Car. I  remember when my Father told me that the Outdoors wasn't managed by anyone. Said it was weird to have a single entity managing it. For a brief moment, I think that I ought to be able to leave my house if I chose to do so. But really, it had just been a very long maintenance period. These sorts of thoughts go away with time. At least, that's what Google.Health told me. 

I took the package back to my G-Kitchen and tossed it in the heat application. I resume watching the media from the last upload. As all actors and what not are also in Maintenance Mode we've been subjected to re-runs from times past.

*Two more days pass*

I am awoken to a pleasant chirping,  my Google-Bedroom's walls were dancing with happy looking images and a bright message was flashing on my doorway. I walk over to it. 

*Update Completed. Enjoy your new features and explore your newly improved Google-Earth!*

""Finally!"" I gasp, ""It's truly about time!"" 

I take my clothes from the dispenser, put my glasses on and make my way towards the front door. The Google-Neighborhood was buzzing with people in my circle, all smiling and looking around. It was a perfect spring day. Our yards were freshly cut and glinting with morning dew, and all sorts of Applications were blinking with their updated features. 

Curiously I select Google-Maps first. ""Wow would you look at that!"" I say. The map  was completely connected now. Google-Iraq, Google-Iran, even Google-Korea had been expanded to where it bordered Google-China. And would you believe it, a brand new sea, now called the AfganiSea where disconnected Afghanistan used  to be. I had to admit, it looked much nicer now. No more gray areas. 

I look to my left, ""Oh look, new neighbor!"" I say as I walk across the lawn. ""Hello!"" 

""Hi there, name's Rick!"" My new neighbor says. He's a friendly looking guy. Not like Ben who used to live there. Ben was starting to make everyone worried, always making Complaint-Requests. 

It seemed as though Google had the answer after all. ",micmea1

"[EU] The XCOM Project has been activated and alien assaults are being seen and fought against on a weekly basis, globally. You live in this world: where the monsters are at the door, about to break in.",tyrannosaurus_r,"The aliens came in with no warning. In truth, most people in our city didn't even believe the rumors when we heard them. Alien assaults and abductions across the globe? A secret worldwide government organization that was fighting against them in the dark corners of the world, XCOM? No one believed it. I mean how could we really?

That was until they came to our city in the night. The loud screech of their ship flew overhead and just began to wreak havoc across every known street corner and alleyway. Tiny little creatures swarmed from them and overwhelmed us, tall men-like beings that had lived in our town turned against us, and these gorilla-like creatures who wore great armor barreled into the city with their weapons on auto. The screams of my neighbors have continued to haunt my dreams.

I don't know what happened after that. I ran back home, making sure I got to my wife and child before anything else happened. I heard the screams though, and the yells, and the explosions. I heard the destruction of my city as I ran, like a coward. 

And now we're sitting ducks. The creatures have systematically moved through the town and every so often the screams will return, as loud and vivid as I remember them. They're hunting us. For what, I do not know. And the why is still a mystery. I don't even know what the XCOM team looks like, let alone if they even truly exist. But my daughter seems to think so, she seems to think they're coming.

But it has a day since the aliens arrival and I am sure that this organization should have heard about it by now. If they are as truly great and mighty as the rumors say, they should have been here to get these creatures from our home. Yet the screams persist, the yells of humanity echo through our city.

Now, they're at our door, hitting it with God-only-knows-what and yelling in a language I do not know, nor care to understand. They are here though, that much is true. Aliens have arrived on Earth and some walk among us, waiting for their leaders to come so they can strike. They are here. And they are not forgiving.

The banging is louder now and my wife and daughter are in the basement. I am hoping that they will take only me, so that at least my daughter can grow up have a life. Maybe the XCOM team will still come, maybe she'll still have something to believe in. Because right now, the only thing I believe in is that we don't stand a chance.

Not if we abandon each other. Not if we don't try to fight.

They're getting inside now. I have to fight. For my daughter. For my wife. To show them that there's still hope in the darkest of times. I don't know who I will find, or what I will face beyond that door, but I won't give up.

If the XCOM team did exist, I don't think they would either.

____
*For anyone who doesn't know what happened; last time I played XCOM, I had two cities attacked where their danger was both at four. Hitting five (not doing the mission there) loses that city. Here is one such city where the XCOM team never arrived.*

"[WP] Puberty takes you to a ""Customize Your Character"" screen.",wannabgourmande,"So. Today was the day. Some people call it ""Sim Day"", as the Sims is actually based on it. Today is my 16th birthday. And on our 16th birthdays, we have to go to a secret location, which you only find out about the day before, and then the letter self combusts. If we tell anyone- and they will find out, if we tell anyone, we will be imprisoned and the person we told will also face penalties. And anyone they tell. 

Today was the day I was going to get to choose. I was going to get to choose what I looked like, my personality, my voice. I was essentially, going to be able to make myself over into a new me. The technology is quite swanky, I suppose. Everyone learns about it in school. They lump it in with our sex education, but this is actually considered more important. 

The process, from what we have learned, sounds simple. You go to the predetermined location. You have ID to prove you are who you say you are. You are taken into the workshop/lab/whatever. You then enter a room where you are totally alone, and you choose. 

I notice the time, and realise I need to get the train to where I need to go. My parents would of driven me, but Sim day is something that is done alone, as we can't even tell our parents the location. I leave for the station.

I get on the train and I sit down. The gentleman I sit next to notices I am holding my passport and my birth certificate. ""Important day today, huh kid? Happy birthday, and good luck!"". I want to ask questions, but I can't. Once you have been through the process, you cannot discuss what happens inside with anyone who has not yet been through it. I look around the train. How did these people decide what they wanted? How did that lady decided she wanted curly hair? How did that man decide he wanted green eyes? I don't know what I want to look like. 

I know a few things from school, though. Any changes you make are permenant. I also know that it's going to be one of the hardest choices of my life. I wonder what kind of choices you can make. Can I make my hair permenantly bright red? Can I change my eyes so they are no longer short sighted? 

I get off the train and follow the directions from Google maps. Before long, I am stood outside a high school. This is not to be deceiving- the location is always a generic looking building. It stops people trying to break in and change themselves. The consequences of that are not worth living through, apparently. I imagine it's a bit like what happens to Norman Osborn, in Spiderman. 

I enter the building. A lady is waiting to greet me. She asks me my name, and I confirm it by showing her my ID. Satisfied, we walk down a corridor to what I imagine is the school hall. There are people milling around around computers wearing lab coats, carrying clipboards. I wonder how you get into this line of work- what makes you want to play God in this way?

I am directed towards it. It looms over me, as if predetermining my fate for when I step out of it again. The lady who led me to this room turns to me. ""You have three hours to make your choices. You can set something and go back to it and change it, but once you step out of the machine, everything will be permenant. Understood?"". ""Yes, maam."" I manage to splutter. I step into the machine...",Emilehh0506

[WP] The 7 day creation story of reddit,Black_dynamite55,"The obese man sat alone in his dark den of silence. He was practically obliterated by his depression at this point. There was only one format of entertainment that brought joy to his heart... Except this joy was more in his loins. Ecchi. He was slumped in posture, his own filth tangible to his nostrils. He'd been drawing for days, his efforts to avoid his addiction capitulated by his true love for softcore sexual overtones. This man was ruined. He needed a way to express his art to others who were of a synonymous idealism. No one understood this genuinely troubled man. He was alone in a world where it seemed no one else was. This moment, this thought which had captured all of his troubles, was when it hit him. He would make contact with the others. They were out there. His mission had begun. 

Day 1:
Having just climaxed to his own drawings, he wiped the seminal residue off of his chin, and opened up his internet browser. It was time to get to business. Hours of scouring the deepest corners of the web for some form of outlet proved to be fruitless. He pondered what to do. He left his abode to acquire food and provide himself with the energy he would need to solve this problem. His solution came in the form of his favorite restaurant. Burger King. The company's slogan was exactly what he needed. To ""Have It Your Way"", and his way he intended to have.

[WP] You are flying a Boeing 747 when you hear loud noises behind you.,Calliusthegreat1,"""Captain to Flight Crew, Captain to Flight Crew, Status please?  Is everything okay?""

A slight buzzing rang out as Captain Lowe released his thumb.  Seeing no immense danger from the lack of response, as of right now, the Captain attempted a few more pressing and releasing of the switch and always the low toned buzzing came back to him.

""All systems are reading as normal.  That noise.  That god-awful noise had to have caused some sort of damage.  What could it have been?  Turbulence had been minimal for the long flight.  There's a chance that early turbulence shifted some of the cargo and with the recent flight path, allowing things to shift back.  No, it was too loud.  The noise sounded like, what, a small house being trampled by a massive small house smashing ogre?""  Captain Lower said aloud, he always thought better when reasoning to himself externally.  At least, he thought so.  Most of his family thought it a bit on the crazy side, especially his older sister Marianne.  She was a Physician whose opinions always weighed on Captain Andrew Lowe.

""Captain Lowe to Co-Pilot Garner, Captain Lowe to Co-Pilot Garner, do you copy?""

Again, the low-toned buzzing rang out.

""Well, shit.""  Captain Lowe sighed himself into a standing position partly fearing the current lack of response mixed in with the sound of an Ogre smashing some small to medium sized family's home.  

The next hours of flight were expected to be calm.  He radioed air traffic control over Atlanta and was given approval to run on auto-pilot as he checked on the flight staff.  

Making his way through the small compartment, he cautiously unlocked the Captain's quarters and allowed a large sigh to ring out.  He wasn't someone that was comfortable with large problems and silence in between.  As he found himself in the 1st class quarters, everything was normal.  There were no unexpected lights out, no carts in the aisle, no trash scattered about and no passengers.  

""...""  Captain Lowe's jaw slowly creeped open.  His lower jaw opened just like in those old treasure hunting films.  Slowly.  Eerily.  Creating mystery and wonder as to what would happen next.

Captain Lowe called out as he slowly paced passed the first rows of 1st class, ""Hello, uh, passengers?""

""Passengers?"" He asked himself.

""Is anyone there?"" He asked again as he entered through the cloth doorway into standard seating.

'""How in the hell...*Hello?!*""  He asked louder now.  Before he kept somewhat quiet as if the 1st class passengers were perhaps asleep in the standard seating with everyone else.  As though, maybe, everyone was double-seated comfortably enjoying each other's company.  

""No one.  No one is here.""  He confirmed to the empty seats among him as if preaching to an empty church.

""Ahem.""  Someone called out somewhere in the back to alert Captain Lowe of their presence.

""Yes?  Hello?!  Is someone there?""  Captain Lowe asked, wanting some confirmation to ensure he hadn't just imagine or cleared his own throat and mistaken it for someone else.

""Yes.  I *am* here.""  The voice painted a clear picture that Captain Lowe was not alone.

""Here in the back.  Come join me Captain Lowe.""  He asked of the Captain.

Captain Lowe considered this.  He considered what would happen if he went to the back.  Was this a plane hijacker?  Was this a murderer?  Or shit, a magician murdering hijacker?   How else would the *entire* plane be ridden of its passengers?

Captain Lowe crept towards the voice in the back, one of the last rows which was shaded by the lack of lighting provided.  He wasn't quite sure what would happen but it wasn't as though he felt there were many options at this point.

He reached the voice.  It was a man.  Well-dressed in a suit with glasses and a newspaper seated to his right, crinkled as though he'd just finished up the last page.

""Hello Captain Lowe, how are you this evening?""  He asked.

Taking it rather calm-like, Captain Lowe responded, ""Fine, thanks, yourself?"" almost out of sheer habit provided a quizzical situation as this was taking place.

""I assume you've noticed the lack of passengers here.  Quieter.  Calmer.  Peaceful, yes?  Don't worry, no one is missing or dead or *magicianed* away.  Cute that you'd think I was a magician, Andrew.""  

Captain Lowe tilted his head slightly to the left as he thought, ""Could he read thoughts?  Was he some sort of god or devil or demon or angel or...""

""No, no, no Andrew, I'm no deity.""  The man answered Captain Lowe before he could finish the thought.

It was at this point that Captain Lowe unexpectedly sat down opposite of the man in the aisle seat one row ahead of the man.

""Not running away, Andrew?""  The man asked.

""Where to?""

""Precisely.  Smart man you are, Andrew.""  

Captain Lowe's face crumpled a bit and gave a sarcastic nod towards the mysterious angel-devil, magician-like guy.

""Andrew, I'll be frank, I came here to request your help.  Time is of the essence so you'll need to make a decision in fifty seconds.""  The man confided in Captain Lowe.

""Oh, shit.  Shit.  What's happening?  Is the world ending?  Is this some sort of next-level heroic work?  Do I just say yes or no or what happens when I say no, ohshitdoyoukillme?""

Captain Lowe was at this point dealing with a severe urgency to answer the man as he believe his life would be taken and/or given the chance to be some Superman character in his seemingly average Pilot life.  Captain Lowe could have been seen as 'losing his shit' to some.

The man's face began to crumble as he allowed two immense chuckles to exit his body.  

""Noo, no Andrew, I'm only kidding.  I can't explain it all here and time is *not* of the essence.  You're actually sleeping, Andrew.""

""I'm *what*?""

""You're sleeping.  Everyone is gone because you're dreaming and I have control of your dream.  Well, except control of your thoughts.  The things you're saying and thinking are your own.  But I do have control of your physical body, thus the reason you've seemed so calm and made your way towards me.  You had little control over that.""

""Ahh, fuck you then.""  Captain Lowe deadpanned.

""Quite.  Well, Andrew, our time is up and you've got a plane to fly.  If you would like to know more about the need I have of you, then please contact me.""

""Wait, wait how do I do that?  And what was the loud noise I heard?  And who the *hell* are you?!""  Captain Lowe demanded.

""You'll find a way to reach me.  You cannot know who I am, yet.  And the loud noise was the co-pilot banging on the locked door as you fell asleep and the plane began to descend in altitude.  Better hurry up and save the plane, Andrew.  Good luck.  And i'll be waiting to hear from you.""

It was at this moment that Captain Lowe began hearing loud alarms and the man slowly disintegrated into the control panel in front of Captain Lowe of where the loud alarms were blaring from and from behind the Captain was the co-pilot continuing to bang on the door, screaming, ""**CAPTAIN, WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?!?**""

Once, twice, three times it struck; as the world seemed to hold its breath. 

Two titans arose from the muddy banks. 

Two men chiseled hard by the toil of the earth. 



Rain soon washed the two giants clean; revealing the scars beneath 

These were warriors of old, and brothers in blood 

Truly no mortal stood their equal



With a roar the men engaged 

Muscle ripping flesh 

Strong hands gripped stronger arms 

As the warriors continued their struggle 



Their will was as Oak 

Their resolve unbending 

Their mind willing their might and bodies towards the glorious prize 



For the victor would claim a dynasty 

Seven hills bathed in golden sun 

The victor would become legend 

A name whispered in fear, proclaimed with honor, second to none 



Night and Day the two giants struggled 

And their cries intensified 

But on the third only one stood tall 

Only one leviathan towered in the rain 



With broken bones and a shattered heart, he knelt beside the fallen

As tears mixed with rain, he buried his brother warrior 

“Rest now, and go in peace” he whispered

“For this struggle of ours is finished” 



Then he rose as a champion king 

A leader of a nation 

And so it was with this splendid might 

Romulus came into awe-inspiring power

Honestly, that was tiring. My house has been messy for years because friends would come over, and have fun. By have fun, I mean destroy the entire place, especially by trying on clothing and throwing them on the floor. My friends apparently aren't as sophisticated as they should be. There needs to be order in the house. And I'm the only one to solve that problem. I've managed to iron all of my clothes and fold them the way an *decent* human being should.

They call me a neat freak. But that's because they're jealous that I can instantly find my phone, while they tear the house just for a phone. A small, freaking PHONE. And they can't find that document they need now. Unlike them, I fully use the power of organization and am currently one of the best secretaries in my company. Checkmate, lazy bums!

I'm rather curious as to why my friends aren't hanging out like we always do. I mean, they do need to cram in some work, but I'm not sure if that work takes five whole days. Also, the neighborhood's unusually quiet. But of course, maybe that me. But of course, what if it's a story plot? Like maybe everyone suddenly vanished and I have to find them. Or maybe there's a killer on the loose. Or, maybe even a zombie apocalypse! Well, that's enough fantasizing, there's absolutely no way that there's going to be serial killer, much less a zombie apocalypse.

I'll prove it to myself! (I really should stop fantasizing.)

See, no noth - NONONONONONONO THERE'S NOT A ZOMBIE THERE. AND there. And there.

""He did not tell the syndicate about you, I did. He told the police that he wanted a way out and we agreed on this plan to lure the syndicate here so the police could catch them. He apparently wanted a quicker way out and a way to make you guilty"" 

A pounding was heard on the door, as I set down the gun. Josh was freaking out and about to have a seizure and Andri was quietly chuckling to himself. Sitting back down considering what I have done I ask him what is so funny. 

""Oh, nothing, Just that he might have been the luckiest one out of all of us""

"[IP] The forms were cast in a red, hissing glow",The_Eternal_Void,"*Not much further now.*

Asgeir held the sizzling torch, an unnatural lurid light illuminating the tunnel.

Shadows danced on the walls, the forms cast in a red hissing glow.

The concrete beneath his feet was smooth, marking a clear path forward.

Something shifted in the darkness ahead.

Asgeir stopped, holding up the torch, peering into the darkness.  A low guttural growl emanated from the deep, echoing eerily through the tunnel.

The man dropped his torch to the floor, pulling out a vial of liquid.  Unstopping it, he drained the contents, throwing back his head and choking the substance down.

Asgeir’s eyes dilated; his heart began to beat faster.  

The ongoing growl became more malicious, ripping up into a vicious barking. 

He could see them now.  Through enhanced vision, the man could see the hulking forms of two Wolves lurking in the tunnel ahead.  They were transfixed by the light, steadily creeping closer by the second. 

These were no ordinary Wolves.  They were what some would call werewolves; others preferred the term mutants.  Regardless, the six foot tall creatures were the reason Asgeir was down here now.

The man’s body rippled, the final effects of the potion finally kicking in.  Asgeir hunched over, letting out a scream that drowned out the barking from the Wolves.  He felt his figure swell, growing in size.
Looking back up at the Wolves, the man’s eyes were now glowing the same red that was being emitted by the discarded torch.

As if triggered by some unseen switch, both of the Wolves launched themselves at Asgeir.  He was able to reach up and grab one of the beasts by the throat; the other latched itself to his arm, thrashing about violently.  Wincing at the pain, Asgeir threw himself downward on the animal that was tearing at his flesh.  With a yelp, the Wolf let go, trying to squirm out from under the man.  The Wolf that Asgeir had in his grip was clawing at his front.  Asgeir swiftly crushed its throat, proceeding to use the mutant as a bludgeon against its companion.  Tossing the broken form of the first Wolf aside, Asgeir firmly grabbed ahold of the one pinned underneath his weight.  He hoisted it into the air, slamming the Wolf down onto the concrete floor.  

There was a yelp, followed by a silence in which Asgeir’s heavy breathing was the only sound that filled the void of the tunnel.  

The man could feel the effects of the potion coursing.  He needed to haul the Wolves to the surface before he lost his strength. He stooped down and grabbed the two Wolves, throwing them over his shoulder.  Picking up the red torch from the ground, Asgeir began the long walk back.",jamesvontrapp
[IP] Theory sucks...,The_Eternal_Void,"""Focus!"" he snapped, his white beard flicking back and forth with each syllable. I rolled my eyes and looked towards the damned owl that served the old man as a second pair of eyes.

""I'm here,"" I answered in exasperation, unrolling a scroll and skimming it. *The Building of Vayus* the title read and I sighed. *Another history of the city?*

""In body, perhaps,"" the old man answered. ""But in mind you are far away. Tell me, young warrior woman,"" he continued mockingly. ""What monsters are you fighting today in that head of yours?""

""Old men who bore villagers to death,"" I answered testily and he chuckled. In front of me, Alberth scribbled notes on his parchment, following every word the old man said. I glanced towards my sword, thinking of how enjoyable it would be to thwack him with the flat end a few times. The old man coughed at me and I looked back towards him. ""What?"" I asked.

""The building of Vayus was not without action if it is boredom you are so worried about,"" he explained patiently. ""The hill tribes killed many young men and violated countless young women before our forefathers drove them back into the mountains."" I shrugged. I had heard the story a dozen times. All the old ladies weaving baskets down in the market assumed I would be delighted to hear them drone about how the city was when they were born a hundred years ago. And this wrinkled old man with his protruding nose and his beard that curled down to his toes was even worse. Each day, he badgered me about my studies until I caved and read another scroll while he talked and talked. *I'll be as old as him by the time I'm done...* I thought to myself.

""...They never recovered Sir Arvan's mighty sword."" the old man droned on and I perked to attention, scowling for having missed the first part of the story. ""Some say Nature claimed it as her own and that it is at the core of the largest tree in the Dark Forest. Others say it is at the top of the tallest mountain, sitting in the first place the sun shines each morning and the last place it shines each night.""

""Why is this sword so special?"" I interrupted and the old man finally smiled at me. 

""Ah, now you are interested, I see."" I rolled my eyes but nodded, leaning forwards on the rock I sat on. Alberth had stopped his incessant scribbling and now looked up towards the old man. ""This sword was not crafted like any other sword. A small man made it, the last dwarf, some say. The steel was forged in the embers of a phoenix and cooled in the watery blood of a kraken. Invincible, some say it was, and light as a feather but capable of slicing through steel and stone and even dragonhide as easily as butter. Varonis she was called, hero in the Ancient Tongue.""

I stood abruptly, my parchment falling to the ground as the feathered pen drifted down after it. The old man smiled at me knowingly. ""Do not bother, young lady. Men have spent hundreds of years and entire lives seeking that sword. But each time they find the thickest tree, there is another a bit thicker and each time they reach the tallest mountain, they look up to see a taller mountain."" I shook my head vehemently.

""I will find the sword,"" I stated with a shake of my head, remembering the clearing I had come across as I strolled through the depths of the forest a few moons past. I had thought it was a clearing at least, but when I looked up I saw nothing but leaves covering an empty space larger than a dozen castles. I grabbed a scroll from the pile that lay against a tree trunk and scowled as I read the title, searching for another. ""Here it is,"" I said, pointing at a line near the middle of the script. ""Greatness is not a man's size but what he does with the size he has."" The old man stared at me curiously and tilted his head, urging me to continue. ""It is not the tree with the largest trunk. It is the tree whose leaves claim the most ground. And it is not the tallest mountain but the mountain that when you look upwards, you see naught but the gods."" 

With that, I grabbed my sword and my sack filled with stale bread and a waterskin and turned towards the Dark Forest, the mountains rising behind it. The branches of the trees leaned down to snatch at my arms and unseen animals scurried around the underbrush and I felt a thousand curious and hungry eyes tracking my every step. *Varonis*, I whispered to myself. *Varone.* Heroine.

[IP] Old meets new,_John_Locke_4815,"The old man came to him through the faint, shimmering curtain from the magnificent city.  George watched him approach, but waited for the messenger to come to his chambers.  The old man had showed a sigil of the order, one to which George himself belonged. It was enough to grant the old man an audience, nothing more.  
George went to meet him in the formal appointments closet.  The old man entered and offered the respects befitting one of George's station with a certain stiffness, as if unaccustomed to bowing to one so young.  
""Well, Sir Frederick, why have you come?  It was most impolite not to state your business at once.""  
Sir Fred bowed slightly. ""My Lord, it is scarcely believable, and I did not wish to overtax your servant.  I am-""   George cut him off.  
""I am the only who may rightly decide that the limits of my servants. And you should remember that in your manner to me.""  
The old man twitched a bit, startled.  ""Of course, your Majesty, please forgive this old fool.  My message is of such import that I momentarily forgot myself."" His manner was in all ways contrite, but his eyes seemed to twinkle as from a personal joke.  
""Then state your business, Sir, We are not idle this day.""  George motioned to the window. ""There are matters of the Realm to consider.""  
""Erm, yes,your Majesty, it is concerning that - apparation - that I have come.  Your Majesty must- *should* not venture beyond that veil.""  
""Why?  Do you presume to instruct your King?""  George's manner was sharp.  
""No, your Majesty, my purpose is to illuminate its nature and warn of its dangers.""  Ignoring the reactions of the king's  guards, he reached into a pocket of his vest and removed a small figurine, slightly larger than his thumb.  He held in the palm of his hand. George did not move, but courtier scurried forward to take the object from the old man check -very briefly and discreetly- for any hazard it may be then move to the throne to offer it on bended knee.  
George gave it a quick glance, then second longer look. He picked up the object, examining it on all sides.  It was a figure of George himself, as an quality toymaker might have cast in pewter and then painted.  But it held George's gaze because he knew *this* figurine. It -or its exact twin- had been part of a set gifted to him not a fortnight ago by... hmm by whom? George could not recall. But in examining its exquisite details previously, including the sword arm that actually could move, George had dropped it. The paint on figure had been scratched. A scratch *this* figurine also had.   
""What trickery is this?"" He demanded.  
The old man seemed unconcerned at the sharpness in the younger's voice.  ""Not trickery, your Highness, but convoluted truth. It is, as you suspect, the same figure that sits in your inner chambers at this moment. It is next to book on the Portuguese flying balloons.  
At this George started ""How dare you sir, the King's chambers are -""  he stopped suddenly, thinking.  He glanced at courtier who had brought him the figure, who then disappeared to his chambers.  
""Be sure, sir knight, you will hang before the new moon if you have stolen from the King.""  
The old man smiled and bowed. ""I have no fear of what your chamberlain will find, your Majesty."" 
In the awkward moment of silence that followed, he continued ""Your Majesty is wise to study the science of the Portugee invention.  During your reign, you will see humans fly in such balloons.""  
George's gaze remain fixed on the old man.  
""What do you know of this"" he waved at the etherial structures outside the castle windows. ""This city that has appeared outside my summerhouse?""  
The elder straightened a bit. ""It is what it appears, a city of magnificient form.  But it is corrupt inside, its people given to excess and lechery.""  
The young king turned toward the window. ""But you came from that city. Are you also given to such things?""  
""Your Majesty, I am here because I am not.  But in your time, you will strive to prevent this city from coming about. ""  
""I will?"" The king's tone was bemused.  ""How are you so sure? Or are you instructing me again?""  
The chamberlain reappeared with the book and a box.  The king impatiently waved him over.  The king took the box and opened it. Inside, on velvet cushions, a set of finely crafted figures reposed. There were no empty slots. The king took up the figure of himself from the box and held it next to its mate the old man had given him.  They matched almost exactly. Certainly the scratch the king had put there was exact. But the king noticed that the paint from the old man's figure was worn, the colors a bit less sharp than the others.  
Wondering, the king examined the old man again.  ""Who *are* you?""  
The old man bowed again, a bit less stiffly. ""George William Frederick, son of George the Second, prince of Wales, king of the United Kingdom - excuse me, your Majesty, king of Great Britain and Ireland."" 
George raised his hand as if to strike the elder for his treasonous claim, but stopped.  ""United Kingdom?  What is-""  
Now the elder saw his moment.  ""It has not happened, my lord, but it will. In your august reign.  But the city - it is a vain struggle.""  
Bewildered, George tried to catch up ""How can you be me, what is the kingdom united against, and how does that city concern any of it?"" ",holobonit
[IP] Old meets new,_John_Locke_4815,"Zhang Wei tugged helplessly away from the man, but his grip on her tiny infant hand was remorseless and slightly painful, his knuckles white, his lips pursed with apparent malice. He dragged her through the dilapidated streets and shacks, seemingly towards the sleek aluminium platform at the end of the dusty road. The girl couldn’t be older than five - still too young to have ever had a haircut, and several male denizens of the village looked on, impassive, the one ahead of them cruelly tightening the bridle on a skeletally-thin horse until its eyes bugged out, the one in the door of the shack from which they’d emerged idly sharpening an old-world knife, not intervening, gazing with if anything slight amusement. 

The man cast a very long shadow that swept back through the mute grey of the street - his tall, thin body catching the light from the onway that swept parabolically above them, and he took each step with a kind of deliberate inevitability, each one making it clear to Zhang Wei that she had no choice in the matter.


“I don’t…no, I don’t want to go on the on again”, she begged him, “I don’t want to, please, not now, let me go back...”


A passer-by cackled with mirth, and the man barked at her with the particular monosyllabic ferocity and harshness only a cantonese speaker can muster, and redoubled his grip. *Fwoosh*. The on platform ahead seemed to distort slightly in the lamplight, and the twenty-or-so ghostly figures who had been standing on it suddenly stretched out into an impossibly-long streak that shot away down the track, swept up like white, etiolated leaves along a roaring aqueduct.


“Zhang Wei, do not worry, it’s not yet time, but that time will come, and then you will most certainly go on the on with me again.”

“Then let me go, I want to see the smither again!”

“The *smith*, not the smither, Zhang Wei.” His tone slightly softer, chiding. “But first we must see the horse-keeper.”

“Please! The Smither, the Smither!”

""We must see the horse-keeper first."" 

She began to cry pitiably, and the man with the horse began to cackle too.

The man sighed and squeezed Zhang Wei's hand a little harder - he had sacrificed so much to afford this trip, and predictably, his little one had fallen in love with the first old-world exhibit she had seen, and had summarily decided that the rest of the park held no interest for her, even though she had begged him for months to take her.


He breathed deeply and tried to think less like an adult, and then turned on the spot, letting her lead him back to where the smiling and slightly grizzled smith was still sharpening his knife, forehead glistening from the heat of his now slumbering forge.

"[WP] Once I was an accountant, now I am a demon lord.",walking_mountain,"They don't teach this in school.

I graduated from Stanford 3rd in my class. I formed my own firm, where I specialized in aiding my employers in keeping their assets tax exempt. In my office, I had the tax law of 100 countries. I also had dummy corporations on 5 continents. Then I met Lucius. He came in one day and asked me to help him manage his accounts. The commission alone was enough to set me up for retirement, and all I had to do were a few simple actions, nothing I hadn't done a million times before. He watched and listened carefully as I described what I would do, and he nodded and signed the paperwork. Then he gave a weird smile, and said,

""You're under arrest.""

I panicked, I reached for the revolver under my desk, it only had one bullet. My hand never got under the table. I only felt a pain in my chest.

I opened my eyes, and saw the fire. ""Oh God, I'm...I'm...""

""Yes, you're in Hell. I'm the Devil. Welcome Jack. I heard you were an accountant, I need someone to manage the souls I've captured. God sets such annoying taxes on them."" This man, all red, holding a pitchfork, laughed, a terrible sound.

So I got the same job in my afterlife, that I had in my regular life. I managed souls instead of money. While my evil master was less malevolent to me than most of his minions. I still had it rough. One day, while negotiating for an off-site tax haven in Purgatory, I tricked one of those foolish creatures into making the check out to me, not to the Devil. I didn't correct the mistake, instead, it gave me an idea.

It didn't take long, just a couple more centuries. I wrote a small clause into the soul contract, that thanks to some dealings with Abbadon, turned over 49% of the souls in Hell to me. It was supposed to be a loop hole, just a bit of tax maneuvering. When the contract was signed in blood. I smiled, a dark smile. I laughed and showed the other soul contract. I now had a controlling interest in Hell. I grabbed my new pitchfork, and I reminded everyone what the nature of pain was.",throwmeawaw

"[TT] Two people, entwined by fate. Together they embarked the journey of heroes, where through loss and gain they grew wise and powerful. Years later, they are on the opposite sides of war.",walking_mountain,"''Do you remember, my friend? The days when we would ride together across the plains, into the nothingness of the steppes. I remember the warm sun of those days and the bluest skies a man could ever witness. We rode across those plains as if we were brothers, sharing food, water, tales and friendship, but perhaps that did make us brothers to some extent. We only sought to carve out a tale in the stars for ourselves, but somehow that all led to this. I miss those days, for they were simpler than any days after. 

But, I do not mourn the loss of them. Innocence is only something that can be held by children and the simplicity of life that we enjoyed was also something only children can have. We did our best, didn't we? We served the lords of Amgalam well. We destroyed those who came to destroy us and in return we marched into their lands. We went on and on, smashing those before us, sacking their cities and avenging our losses, until we finally reached the end of it all, of the world. Is that not faithful service? I remember it was in those days that although life was not simple, my heart was pure, as was yours. It was not simple, but it had its joys. Even in death I will love the companions that fought alongside me, even in death I will think proudly of how I served my king, even in death I will love that strange woman from the end of the world that I somehow managed to convince to marry me, and the sons she bore me. 

Only the holiest men can avoid burdening their hearts, sullying their honor. When the line of the ancient kings died, they left us so far from home. Us soldiers, strangers in a strange land. We all took our sides. You wanted to go home, I understood that. I'd made a life here though in these strange lands and I wasn't quite ready to go. I couldn't bear to watch as it all fell apart. We had died for this realm, for this kingdom, so should our sacrifices have been in vain? Is it not an act of service to your king to ensure his legacy stands? I killed, I destroyed. Was it not for a greater cause? Because, I did it. Twenty years and I kept it all together. Where there were squabbling tribes and warmongering cities, there I created a state. I settled, I built! Yet, when I finally return to the homelands, only blades and spears are there to greet me? You, my friend, cursing my name, leading an army against me?

Should I have turned back? Perhaps, it could've avoided bloodshed. But all I wanted was to finish my life in the land of my forefathers. That it has led to this, does not make it any less worth it. The last choice of a man is how to die, and perhaps that is the most important choice of all. Here I lie, defeated by my friend, my brother, in my homeland, with little time left. Remember when we defeated the emperors of the east? Or perhaps, remember when you fell in love with my sister and you wouldn't stop blushing? Do you remember when we would swim in the sea as children to escape the summer heat? Yes, remember those things, instead of the war, the bloodshed. Remember us riding into the sunny steppes with the blue skies. Remember that, my friend, my brother, as I die here. And.. forgive me.''

"[TT] Two people, entwined by fate. Together they embarked the journey of heroes, where through loss and gain they grew wise and powerful. Years later, they are on the opposite sides of war.",walking_mountain,"""Why, Atrexus? Why?"" The man looked lost, his green eyes looking at the old man he had spent so many years traveling with. ""Why would you do this? You threaten the very world. Your armies of the dead kill all with a touch, and then your army swells. You’ve already destroyed an entire nation. Why do you threaten us all?"" 

""No, Stephen. I do not threaten. I promise. I will destroy it. I will reduce it all to slag and rubble. We have failed. The great noble experiment that was man is a failure. All that remains is death. We've walked the same worlds, seen the same futures. We both seen that no matter what we do, the magics that we have unleashed will lead to the destruction of all that we hold dear. We have done this, not I. We have begun the awakening of the world serpent, and a thousand years from now, this very globe will be shattered upon his waking. I'll destroy it all first. I’ll lull the beast back to sleep with a thousand years of silence. I'd rather be a villain than a well-meaning fool."" 

""Can't you see how impossible this all is? We might have woken the Wurm, but we have a thousand years to prepare for his arrival. The future is not set. Mayhaps a child will be born who can reset the Harp, or a musician talented enough to play a new melody upon it. It need not end now. Send your shades back to sleep. Your army of undeath will not kill us all. I won't let you."" 

""Now, that almost sounded like a threat. We delved too deeply, pursued knowledge too strongly. We bent the flow of the Well of Time. If I could go back, I'd kill us in our sleep, but I have to settle for silencing the world, and hoping that it’s enough to lull the beast back to sleep. Maybe the next species that rises will do better than us. Man has failed. We failed man."" 

""No, we didn't fail man. The magics we brought back cured most incurable diseases, allowed for near instantaneous travel between cities and insured that no blight would ever infect crops. War is an afterthought, and has been for 3 full generations. We are revered and in time, my friend, we can solve this like you and I have solved death for ourselves."" 

""Yes, we made marvels. Portals and gimmicks to amuse a crowd. And as for us, have we truly conquered death? And now, with no idea of what war is, that crowd has gathered, mobilized against me. They turn easily, old friend. They always will."" 

They turned on you because you turned on them. You called them a cancer on the world, needing to be excised from its skin. You gathered an army of the dead to threaten their very lives, and I asked for volunteers to be armored in protective magics and armed with enchanted blades to stand against you because I hoped you'd see reason. Killing us all might not save the earth. Leaving us alive might not kill it. Let us see what the future holds together.""
“Together. No. There is no more together for us. There cannot be. We are two opposed forces trying to achieve the same end in different means. You wish to ascend mankind to where we might re-achieve what was lost, and put the beast back to slumber. I wish to be sure of it by making sure he has no reason to awaken. Your path places mine in jeopardy as man becomes louder and more populous. My path requires the death of most of humanity. Your path almost certainly leads to the destruction of all. We’ve walked those futures as ghosts, seen the shattered remnants of humanity’s attempt to ascend in the face of eldritch horror. It doesn’t end well. We two are too few to placate the Wurm, and I grow weary of attempting.”
“And what of the wonders we have seen while traveling together? Of the fields of Merrilor, where the waves in the grass looked perfectly like waves upon the ocean, or of our sojourns among the worlds-not-yet-fallen, where we learned the intricacies of geometric magics and how to capture a moment permanently in a fold of space, of how to keep time in a bottle. Is that the world we met Oriana? I never can-“

“Stop!” The old man’s voice thundered from him, and the great battlefield outside the tent, with its serried ranks of men and its legions of glowing green phantoms all ceased to move for a second. “Never. Mention. That. Name. Again.” His glare smoldered, and the table under his hand was reduced to ash in an instant. 

“Why? You threaten humanity with extinction and want me to not mention the best part of life you ever experienced? You’ve forgotten much, old man. Mankind is meant to love, to learn, to grieve and grow. Don’t let your sadness sweep us all away. Your grief at her death should not blind you to-“

The old man held up a hand. “No. That’s not why I don’t want her mentioned. I know I live with grief in a way that I shouldn’t, that I should have been able to come to terms with her loss over the last few centuries, but I can’t. The reason I ask for you to not mention her name is that it reminds me very seriously that it is her death that will awaken the Wurm. A death I could not prevent, even though I am the master of death. I could not forestall the one death I wanted to, and now I have doomed the multiverse. “
“Her death does not mean that the Wurm will awaken, Atrexus. You know that. In some worlds, the Wurm awoke and she was the one that fought it, and in some, she was its summoner. The future is in flux. Give me my thousand years, send your spirits back to their rest, and find a new path, old man. The only sure path is not guaranteed. We can find a new one.”
""You have always been an idealist, and I the pragmatist."" The old man stood, the joints in his frame cracking as he stretched. He leaned heavily on his staff. ""The future is always in flux. A thousand different endings to every conversation. I am to be the villain here. The world will remember me as an evil. Just remember that we both have bloodied hands, Stephen. When you think back to today, and investigate my claims, you'll wonder if I might have been on the right track. When you look back through the Well, and you see what I witnessed there, you might even understand. But I'll leave you to ponder this: the one thing you haven't figured out is why you haven't aged in a hundred years and why I have. When you do figure that out, you'll understand why I was ready to end it all today. Goodbye, Stephen. We won't meet again."" 

With that, the older man gestured sharply, and a bright green flash burst through the tent. When the afterimages cleared from Stephen's eyes, he saw the trademark burn scar in the earth of a portal spell. He lifted his own hand t follow him with his own portal, but then he looked carefully at the destination chosen by Atrexus. ""That clever old man. He didn't go somewhere in space. He went forward in time. But it appears he left the physical coordinates undefined."" Stephen felt a shiver run across his spine. The old man had teleported himself to everywhere and nowhere at once. He was gone. 

Stephen exited the tent to a great cheer. The army of free men he had raised to oppose Atrexus's army of the dead was cheering. They had witnessed his fell army dissolve, and the great portentous cloud began to dissipate. Sunlight fell in among the ranks of the men, and Stephen felt uplifted. He had done it. He had faced down the dark wizard Atrexus and convinced him to abandon his genocidal plan. And yet, something he had said, was it about the Well? Or was it the remark about aging that needled him? It didn't matter. He had a thousand years to plan and plot for a way to stop the Wurm. Genocide could not have been the only option. Could it?

Wait. Did he say he’d been grieving for centuries? That was impossible unless . . . Oh no.

The shadows deepened the wrinkles of the long years since they'd seen each other, and highlighted the scars that Tevon had watched him earn. Lorem furrowed his brow - deepening the shadows further - and sighed, ""You truly won't back down? You won't give her up?""

Tevon's face, though suffering less scars than Lorem's, still had its wounds nevertheless. These scars had once been a shared memory, a permanent monument to their great history, to the journey they had shared. Now, they felt like wounds reopened to Tevon.

Grimacing, Tevon nodded. ""You know me, Lorem. You know that I won't give up for what I believe is right.""

Lorem shook his head, flabbergasted. Tears stung at his eyes. ""You speak of *knowing*, of *understanding*, and yet... yet you cannot bring yourself to believe in *my* cause?"" Lorem's fists clenched, in his lap. ""We fought together for years, united as one. My blade, your sorcery. My intelligence, your wisdom. And we won."" The fire flickered, shadowing Lorem's face, as he looked away to the tent's entrance, out to the battlefield that lay outside. His gaze lingered, but he looked back to Lorem, his face wiped of emotion. 

""We were brought together by fate. We were powered by destiny. Our victory was prophecy - as was our journey, our foe, our *life together*..."" Lorem couldn't bring himself to even hide the tear that he shed. ""And you deny that? You deny fate itself? You deny the prophecy that guided so many years of our lives?""

Tevon crossed her arms. ""Lorem, I understand that prophecy is important to you -""

Lorem scoffed. ""Important! Do you not remember how we met? It was scarcely chance. I was *sent* to find someone like you, Tevon. We would *never have met* if it weren't for that.""

Tevon's expression darkened ominously. ""I do not appreciate being interrupted, Lorem. You have earned much kindness from me, even in these trying times - and we will forever share a bond, even on opposite sides of a battlefield. But to interrupt me when I am attempting to *sympathize* and *make peace* - that is not something I can accept, even from one I love.""

Lorem winced, and nodded. ""I apologize, Tevon. It's just..."" He let himself trail away. He knew she would understand.

And she did - she nodded, leaning back, resting her arms on her lap. ""I do. Now, as I was saying... this has always been our largest divide, Lorem. In the stars you see writing. In them, I see nothing,"" Tevon looked up, as if her eyes could pierce the tent to look to the night sky. For all Lorem knew, maybe she could. Her magic had weakened with age, but her ingenuity had only grown, giving her a more subtle and intriguing style of magic. ""I cannot accept destiny. I can accept that we contrived to make a prophecy come true, but not that it was *destined* to be so.""

Lorem sighed. ""It's just so hard to believe, Tevon... after all the things we witnessed... after all the predictions of the prophecy... and even your *place* in it. You see yourself as nothing more than a random bystander, chosen by chance, rather than the universe itself?""

Tevon nodded, gravely. This was not a conversation she had ever enjoyed. And especially not in trying times such as now.

""Lorem, if you had not found me, you would have found some other sorceress who would have agreed to help you find some unknown evil. And two ambitious and powerful allies, on a quest to find evil, will surely find it somewhere... it's everywhere around us, after all."" Tevon said these words ominously, but was careful to keep the intent clear - the two of them in this tent were good. But around them, this battlefield, this war - that was evil. She let her thoughts return to speech - ""Around us on *both* sides.""

Lorem leaned back into his chair, his lips pursed. He nodded, slowly. He had thought the same. ""This war is contrived. Even as we find ourselves naturally coming to fight each other, from our own beliefs..."" He knew Tevon would pick up on his thought. Indeed, she was thinking it herself - 

""Whether by destiny or manipulation, there is another force at play. Yes,"" Tevon looked down to her hands, which she was wringing anxiously. ""Yet despite of this, I cannot back down. And you cannot either,"" she quickly noted, looking back up to Lorem with a hint of questioning in her voice. To her dismay, he nodded in answer.

""No harm will come to the girl, Tevon. You know this. She will be watched, and kept safe, and raised and grown as any member of royalty would."" Lorem shuffled papers on the table again. Possible agreements, treaties, compromises. ""But we cannot let her out of our sight. It is better to be safe than sorry.""

""You truly think so? You know just as well as I do that your side yearns for her death more than her imprisonment. 'Better to be safe than sorry', as you said."" Tevon cast a disdainful glance at the papers - all of it insipid with politics and some shrewd hand at work, all to kill a little girl.

""I will protect her, I promise, Tevon. It is my duty.""

Tevon nodded. ""I know it is your duty. But you know why *I* protect her, don't you?""

Lorem's anger drained quickly, in the face of Tevon's unflinching defense. It had baffled him, when they first met, to know she listened to none of the prophecies, gave no heed to any of the stars, followed none of the celestial paths - yet she was a hero nonetheless, devoted to saving people and risking her life to do so. How could she do it without a greater purpose? And the answer was -

""You make your own purpose, Tevon, from your heart. Your actions are indeed honorable, and I appreciate them, I do. They are why I love you, Tevon, even to this moment. Justice - honor - you don't want the girl charged with a crime she has yet to commit,"" Lorem let his hand fall on his silver belt, the symbol of his faith. The cool metal soothed him normally, but now, it felt hot to the touch. ""Yet in the face of prophecy, the crime was committed eons ago. We cannot change that. But we can be there to minimize that, to give her a chance to change her stars before we must..."" He let the eventual 'necessity' go unsaid.

""And you cannot let her do that herself? Even if we are to assume the prophecy is true, we know - from experience - that prophecy can change. One of us was fated to die, Lorem, in our journey. And neither of us did. We changed that."" Tevon said, desperate with emotion. ""Why can we not let this girl change her own fate?""

Lorem sighed. ""We cannot leave the future of the world to chance."" 

Tevon raised an eyebrow. ""Where do you think this war sprang up from, Lorem? Views such as yours that restrict the fates of men, that judge them before any mortal man could, that assume a *monster* out of a mere *babe*, are what have driven men to war. Me and you were lucky to be *chosen* for good, Lorem. The people who are destined for greatness and good futures will not decry a system that crushes and tramples the futures of many more. Predestination, whether for good or for ill, is not how we should live.""

Tevon let her fury simmer down. Before Lorem could speak up, she raised a hand, stopping him.

""Regardless even of that, this prophecy is a contrivance, Lorem. It pains me to know you can't see that. Someone has found our dividing question, and driven it between us, as a wedge.  This is a ploy to separate us in a time where there *must* be some need for us."" 

Lorem constrained anger in his heart. ""I will not accept criticism of the Augur's work, Tevon. It is divine, from the stars themselves - those words could not be altered for any mortal scheme, I assure you, whether you believe it or not. I *must* act on these words. It is my duty, as it has been since I was a boy. It was the duty that brought me to you, even.""

""I know. I will not fault you for following your duty. But nobody can judge you if you fail while attempting to.""

""I will not fail,"" Lorem said, conviction creeping into his voice. ""I cannot afford to.""

""I'm sorry, Lorem,"" Tevon said, rising from her chair. ""But I'm the one who will decide the price of your failure.""

With a wave of her hand, Tevon bound Lorem with magic to the chair. The glow of aether transmuting into steel made the tent bright, but the flaps of the tent were held down by a wind Tevon had been stirring for the entire conversation. Before Lorem could shout, Tevon wrapped his mouth with a cloth wrapping she pulled from the aether. It was thin, but would do - there was no aether left in the area around them to use, after the expenditure needed for the steel bindings.

""I'm not going to let us fall into a war devised by some unknown adversary, and have us kill each other, or at the very least, one of us die from some pawn soldier. If there is to be war, then you shall not be in it."" Tevon turned to Lorem, tears running down her cheeks. ""I love you too much for that.""

Lorem looked to her, his outrage fading away, being replaced by a bittersweet snarl of love and sorrow.

""I won't let this war come to pass, Lorem. I will stop it before it does. I will find the man behind this prophecy, who drove us apart like this -"" 

Tevon looked to Lorem, with a fire burning in her eyes.

""And I will *end him*.""",TyrRev

Years later, they are on the opposite sides of war.",walking_mountain,"It was when their fortifications came in from the west, casting long shadows over our troops as the sun set behind them, that I knew it was him. 

*Make them wait, then rattle their cages* he'd always said, and in our time together it was a tactic that often cast the tide of the battle to come.

There, standing at the crest of the hill was the black figure of his silhouette; sword held high pointing to the sky causing a shiver to ripple down my spine. He was back.

I rode up in front of our lines and took off my helmet gaurd, setting my long black hair free to show the boys that if even an old girl is unafraid, they need not be either. It worked for the most part, and I felt the nervous clamor of armour cease a little.

I thweeped for Grenly and she flew to my shoulder and clawed at my neck pouch searching for food. I lifted her high and straight and she took off with the power and grace of a bird half her age, making a long arc over the enemy units and dodging the odd arrow that flew her way. 

In the distance I heard a distinct whistle, and her tiny form dived for him as she always had, perching on his shoulder as he stroked her beak slowly. *Would she come back? Does she want to?* She was always his before she was mine, a parting gift between two lovers, seperated by obligate duty and service to our respective kingdoms.

Back then, all were united under the same banner. The best of us went to study and train in their capitols, those serene early years of joustmates and court acquaintances always had the slight bitter edge of political intrigue, but we were kids and paid no attention to such dispassionate things, following our hearts and our desires as we saw fit. 

Most of us are gone now, exhiled or executed, traitors and heroes to one another alike. 

The last of the sunset receded behind the hill and as Grenly landed softly on my shoulder once more, I felt his eyes staring into mine capturing those soft moments we shared together all those years ago, before the darkness finally set in.",localtoast127

I can see ""my him"". i knew he would be back. Sure,  he's left for a day or two,but this time was for a really long time. But why can't I smell my him.? He looks the same, sounds the same, he even feels the same, but he smells different. No, wait, he doesn't smell like anything at all. 

That's  weird. Even  the stinky barking ladydog can see ""my  him"", but she's not going up to him....she's going oupside with us, but just now she  just walked right past him. What  gives? Why aren't we walking together? Why  is my other  guy who usually smells a lot like ""my him"" did just keeps walking around and what happened to the others and my alpha dog? He  raised  me. I used to clean him and  he used to love it. Why  did  they  take  him away? Where did my  little  guy and the sweet new ladydog run off to, come  to think  of  it? I guess they haven't been  around either. It's true.  I can't  sense their scents either.

 How  long  has it  been? I remember a lot  of  people in my house, a lot lot lot of dinner times ago. I'm remembering i am walked by the  nice girl person who  usually comes  with  the  sunny times, and I even think  she  gave  us food during that time....but  he wasn't around. I could catch a whiff of him around the guy they call his brother and once every, see even, I thought I saw him, but I was wrong. He never came, Not even at  night. My  other guy, he's around, he's different but close,  taller, smells great  too, but he just closes the door at  night lately and won't let me in and I stay downstairs with ladydog and  we look for  my  guy...and  HE DOESN'T COME HOME.

 Sometimes  those smelly meow scratchers come up cause they think they hear  him too. But, no. Nothing. Just me  and the barking lady dog. This different  guy  comes  down  in the morning, and  he smells  bad, real bad and me and and  he  pushes me off the  couch and  makes loud noises. He won't  bring  me out. He says, ""stupid dog get away"" and and and he  smells  SO BAD. Then my other  guy  finally comes  down and  I go  out  and  we  walk around, but  then  I get  closed off in a metal cage and he leaves and I'm alone alone alone  until that nice person  girl comes and talks to me and my ladydog. It's just us two now. I think lady dog can  see ""my  him."" She makes me  think of my  him and  when he would come  home  and both hims ,all of us,  all of us  would sit  together and I'd  get  good stuff to eat...if  the  other ones let me and I was fast. I am really fast. 

 They  used to put  the scratchers  somewhere  cause  they were trouble, and  we  would laugh and smelly lady dog  would always bark and  bark. We would go in to the soft room  watch  lights and  sounds on some box with all of the pack  and  then  sleep. Now. Nothing. The  house  smells  different. It  feels different and  you know  what's really  bad. Strange,awful  people--I never  even  smelled them before ....sometimes  come  and  look all around the places I used to hide  in .  The scratchers  are  scared. I'm  scared. My other guy  is  bringing  us all somewhere with  that new  stinky man  who  is always around now. 


I can't  smell  you  any more. I didn't  even  see  you. You  don't  know where I am. A lot of  your stuff was in the  garbag,  why? I don't know  where  you  are. My  other  him  tells  me you're  gone. Move on.  That you're  with  Some other  dogs and you're  OK, but I miss you. I miss your yummy smells and my other pals. He says you're  dead. What  is  that? He says forget. I won't. I can't.

[CW] Your dog has taken up writing.,BaldDudePeekskill,"Today has been pretty good so far. Lady let me sleep on the bed last night. That never happens. (Lady is my best friend.) I’m tired today, but Man gave me extra rations from the table today. That never happens. (Man is my best friend.)

The only bad part about today is that my best friends and me are currently waiting in a room in the place I hate. I think we are waiting for the Man in the White Coat. Usually I would try to escape, but I’m tired. At least my best friends are here with me.

Lady sat in a chair when we came into the room and started crying. Usually I am the one who cries when we are in the place I hate, not Lady. Man sat next to her and hugged her. I was tired and wanted to nap on the floor, but I knew Lady needed me. I slowly wandered over to her and rested my head on her lap. I wagged my tail and looked up at her, just how she likes me too. Usually that helps, but suddenly Man started crying too. I made it worse and it scared me – I never make it worse! So I wagged my tail harder, panted, and whined. I tried to jump up on to the chairs with them, but I slipped. My hips won’t let me jump like that anymore. They kept crying.

Then Man gently picked me up and put me on his lap. I didn’t know what to do, so I just curled up between their laps while they cried and licked Lady’s hand. Man put his arms around me and Lady buried her face in my coat. I’m not sure what’s wrong with them, but it doesn’t matter – I know I'm helping.

I’m tired. Lady and Man aren't crying so hard anymore, so I think I did my job. We are still waiting in the place I hate, but at least my best friends are with me.",IrateProfessional

For the first time ever the woman today reaches out and touches the man's hand.",TheTrueFlexKavana,"The man sat in the booth at the back corner of the run down diner. The same booth he sat in everyday, reading a different novel every time. This time it was Charles Dickens ""Moby Dick"", he had always ordered a hot cup of water for the tea bags he brought himself. He loved this diner, it occupied a max of 3 people this time of night- 2 of which were seated at the bar- the other was the owner. The booths were red but all had a dullness after years of people rubbing against them, the seats a bit tattered and worn down by time. He'd come here everyday for the past 40 years and everyday it was same. A woman, who looked to be in her 60s, would come in and sit across from him. They never said a word to each other, neither needed to, for it seemed they had a language all their own. They moved together with a familiarity that only two people who've known each other this long could. So when she came in and sat down across from him, just like any other night, no one batted an eye. Today though, she said something, the first thing she'd said to this man since the day they started meeting. 
 
She reached across the table and grabbed his hand, the first time they had touched in forty years, and said four words that would change everything for both of them. ""I need your help."" She said it calmly, so calm he almost thought it was his imagination that anything had taken place. Her palm was soft, smoother than any 60 year old he'd encountered but the wrinkles on the back of her hand gave away her age and he looked up at her. This woman whom he'd met with every single day he looked in her soft gray eyes and saw the urgency there. She needed him, that's what he'd been waiting for. Forty years and he had been waiting for her to come to him, the bruise marring her wrist was enough for him to understand. She was shaking and afraid, there was blood on her wedding ring, the wedding ring she had taken to wearing on the day before this one all those years ago, that was why they met here. Her husband presented himself as something other than a monster until he had made his claim in a church and in the eyes of the law. She was his, and like all his other possessions she was just a thing for him to do with as he pleased. 
 
They'd grown up together - the couple in the booth in that small diner- childhood friends who had never parted ways. That's why he made the promise he made, to meet her here. He knew the day would come when she could no longer fight back, when she was fed up. When that day came he made a promise to be at that diner and wait for her to ask for help. This was that day, and by the looks of it, she had already taken care of the hard part. Now it was time for him to do the cleanup. He turned his palm upwards gripping her hand and giving it a small squeeze of comfort, letting her know he remembered. ""Where is he?"" With that small statement, she knew she wasn't alone but they couldn't dwell there for long with the number of tasks ahead of them. Together they got up from the booth, hands intertwined - he carried Moby Dick in his left -his tea forgotten on the table. They walked away from the diner and towards her home to fulfil the promise made between two childhood friends.

For the first time ever the woman today reaches out and touches the man's hand.",TheTrueFlexKavana,"The bell jingled lightly as the man entered Ted’s Diner, continuing his streak of never failing to show for breakfast. Even when the blizzard shocked the small town just outside of Atlanta eight years ago with over two feet of snow, Kevin showed up with a shovel and thermos filled with coffee to help clear the sidewalk. 
“Mornin’,” he said with an almost imperceptible head nod in Ted’s direction as he took his usual seat at the bar. 
Ted returned the acknowledgment.  “Good Morning, Kevin, it’s nice to see you as always.” Kevin responded with a noise that could’ve been a grunt or him clearing his throat, typical for a man who preferred to enjoy his meals in silence.
Kevin then withdrew a newspaper from the small, battered and brown briefcase at his side as he was greeted with a cup of black coffee that always seemed to be ready for him at the perfect temperature. He unfolded the paper and began to read as he took his first sip.
Ted turned to the grill, little slivers of steam rising from its surface, cracking two eggs and placing a few strips of bacon down to prepare breakfast. He lowered the heat on the pot of grits next to the grill, thinking of another patron that would undoubtedly be arriving shortly. Ted chuckled softly to himself as he heard the bell ring for the second time this morning. He knew who it was without looking, but he still spun around enough to look at the woman as he said “Hi Lisa, how are you?”
She said nothing, instead offering a smile that extended to her eyes before she redirected her attention to the man sitting at the bar. Ted did not know the nature of the relationship between these two besides the fact that the both had been here daily for the past four decades, always seated with one stool between them at the bar. He placed the cream and sugar containers next to her placemat as Lisa took her seat. Filing a mug with coffee, he noticed that she was glancing nervously at Kevin while he continued to stare intently at his paper. Ted could hear the bacon popping on the grill behind him; however, he could not force himself to turn away as he watched, in disbelief, as Lisa tentatively reached out and grabbed a hold of Kevin’s hand.
“I forgive you, Kevin,” she said. Kevin stared ahead, appearing to be in shock before finally turning to face Lisa.
“I forgive you,” she repeated. “I have harbored so much anger towards you all of these years and it is time to let it go. The anger was tearing me apart from the inside to the point where I almost have nothing else left.”
She looked into his eyes, searching for a reaction. Remaining silent, he slowly reached into his coat pocket and grabbed a cream colored handkerchief. Dabbing gently at his eye, he exhaled and said “You don’t know how long I have waited to hear you speak again. I… I am very sorry that we lost Brendan….”
His voice trailed off as he struggled to find his next words. Finally, he said “I didn’t eat no white witches, I didn’t. Help me, Help me, ninja! Help me!”

[WP]Time is fraying at the edge.,We-Are-Not-A-Muse,"So, picture this, You’re standing in a bank with both your hands tied up with the comically large sacks of money you just stole when suddenly you’re looking down the barrel of the largest gun you’ve ever seen in your life. Okay, maybe it was a bit of forced perspective making it look slightly larger than it was, however you have to understand that a gun in your face will warp your perspective. Perspective is an interesting concept though, the fact that it can be warped and twisted and no two are the same. Although in that moment I believe this nice police officer and I were thinking about the same thing, “Man you really fucked up coming in here.”

Time is another thing that can be warped. It’s a bit more stubborn than perspective, but a lot less subjective, definitely. Being a scientist had quite a few perks you see. Oh yeah by the way I’m Kevin, really fucking smart and use to be a scientist, nice to meet you. Time isn’t an arrow, it’s not “wibbly wobbly” and it definitely doesn’t go backwards; It is, however, a rope.

I can hear you screaming now, “A rope?! What could he mean?” A rope is a length of smaller ropes, which are strands. Time is a rope being woven together and the strand you are on is determined by the actions of everything and everyone at the time it is spun together. Yeah that’s a bullshit metaphor to make me sound more artistic, time isn’t an actual fucking rope. It does however have a finite number of outcomes to any situation. “Get to the point!” You’re saying now, fine fine!

I have this nifty watch strapped to my wrist. A single press of the button on the side and I will be able to live out a little under five minutes of the most possible future. Yeah that’s fucking bad ass, I told you being a scientist had its perks. The problem though, if you haven’t noticed is that I am currently preoccupied with two things. The first thing is that I have two large bags of money in both my hands and I really don’t think I could hit the button fast enough. The second thing is I just shit myself because there’s a gun in my face.

But a cop isn’t going to shoot me right? He’s gotta uphold the law and all of that bullshit. That’s the last thing I thought at least before he shot me in the fucking face. Dying is a really fucked up feeling. It’s about as fucked up as having the back of your head splatter out behind you. “But Kevin, how are you talking to me if you’re dead?!” Well turns out being a scientist has it’s perks. 

So. picture this. You got this watch that lets you see into the future and you’re thinking about robbing a bank. You may have stolen the watch and the police may have been paid off to find you and get it back. Also you might have pissed off some pretty powerful and shady people taking this thing for a joy ride.

[WP]Time is fraying at the edge.,We-Are-Not-A-Muse,"Its cold. This coldness is unwarranted. It should be hot, as everything burns away, but the air is harsh and crisp. And the tides spin faster than a swirling blender. And the people run as if there is no end, but the birds seem like sloths, and the deer gallop like snails. The sides of my field of view look broken and shattered, like a plate hitting the ground. I see patches of fast and slow. As for me, well the time only existed because of others. I still beat the same heartbeat and breath the same pace. But it doesn’t feel right. I hurt a little inside, an illness as I try to move forward. With no trouble I travel many miles, but see no exhaustion. However, my body is burning, sweating, and racing inside. I only notice this now because at the end, when all physical phenomenon of the universe fail, the inner emotions have no distraction. I am free to observe what I don’t in reality. This is reality, however, it is fantasy. The tangibility of this life is broken, and only ethereal aspects still exists. I am still free to take my eyes and see one thing but believe another. My ears and nose can convey a new scene but I surpass such nonsense that they give me.

[CW] Write yourself into a corner.,We-Are-Not-A-Muse,"This is slightly inspired from a recent story I saw on the news, if you notice the similarities kudos.

I had been young, interested in everything and nothing, like any young man of 17 was at the time. I went to university on a whim, there hadn't been much thought in the process, I had picked to study economics, I did two long hard years of economics before I called it quits. Fuck it, that wasn't what I wanted, simple as that.

The debt was not what I wanted, I was poor, it was the only way I could go to university. But part of me never felt concerned by the copious amounts of money I owed, I was young, what is 40,000$ to a man who came from nothing? A significant amount of money, yet it was a number on the screen, a concept I was familiar with having done economics for a large portion of my late teen years.

I moved country, I fell in love, I started a family, I forgot my immediate family, I made a living, I found happiness.

I ignored debt, I ignored what I owed.

I went back to my country to show my family my upbringing and to try and give some perspective to my children that where I came from had many issues that they will hopefully never have to deal with.

I showed them everything, I had a good experience.

Switch to the present. My 40,000$ loan has gathered significant interest, enough that I have been detained at the airport for not paying back what was required of me. My family have been forced to fly home, I make the living for them. What am I to do?

Still stunned at what I was seeing, the remaining henchman swivelled and brought his pistol up to waist height, too slow, her bullet had already been in the air, it hit his upper right forearm and followed through, grazing the side of my head in the process. The blood poured out, I wanted to scream, but someone else was doing it for me. She fired again, hitting him in the stomach, he crumpled. 

My sister slowly approaches, looks down, and kicks the mobsters gun away.

"[EU] As part of an experimental exchange program, Anakin Skywalker is sent to Hogwarts while Harry Potter goes to the Jedi Academy on Coruscant.",themightyheptagon,"Anakin had been a dedicated student at Hogwarts, obedient and thirsty for knowledge. He had always dreamed of being a Jedi, but being a wizard was... well. The years of Force training required to learn to levitate items took about five minutes and a *""levicorpus""* incantation at Hogwarts.

He had progressed quickly, surpassing most of his peers and gaining the attention and fondness of most of the teachers. He remembered a particularly proud pat on the back from Professor Snape for mastering the Draught of Living Death in second year. 

By year six, he had begun inventing his own charms and curses. A few teachers worried, but most were enthralled by how skilled he was. Some speculated about whether the force within him lent itself to magic, others wondered if his humble origins had prompted his drive to succeed. 

He was in seventh year when it happened- so close to graduating and getting a job, fitting in for the first time in his life. He had been recruited, beautiful promises whispered in his ear by a man who claimed to know what true magic was. A man who had, he said, succeeded in besting death and performing spells the likes of which no one had ever seen.

He promised immortality, money, prestige. He promised a place by his side, ruling the Wizarding world and, eventually every world. Anakin couldn't resist such temptation from the silver-tongued wizard. At the behest of his new master, he slew the newest crop of first-years and fled Hogwarts to join his lord, Voldemort.

He had thought himself free. Free from guilt, weakness, and his past. But one day, he received a visit from an old mentor.

Dumbledore had spoken with such conviction.

""The Death Eaters are evil, Anakin."" He had implored the boy, tears glistening in his eyes. ""Join the Order, you know in your heart it is the right side.""

Anakin steeled himself, strengthening his resolve, and shouted, ""FROM MY POINT OF VIEW, THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX ARE EVIL!""",mr_trick
[WP] Turn a great book into a Buzzfeed article.,I_am_Moby_Dick_AMA,"You Won't Believe These 10 Great Ways That Big Brother Is Helping You

10. Did you know that we are constantly at war? It's true! Big Brother is coordinating our war effort against Eurasia, and you don't even have to worry about it!

9. Maybe you did already know about the war. That's probably because Big Brother is so open with his communication, making sure that the daily updates you receive contain all the important information you need to get through the day, as well as a daily workout!

8. If you need just a little more pick-me-up and the information broadcasts aren't doing the trick, just wait a little longer, and everyone's favorite minute of the day will begin: the One-Minute Hate! Vent all your frustrations at the traitors that tried to tear Big Brother down, and you'll be stress-free for the rest of the day.

7. Does that all sound great to you, but you still don't feel safe and secure? Not to worry! Big Brother has helpfully installed communication screens in all homes, so that you're never more than a few feet from Big Brother. Remember, they're always watching.

6. Reading is hard; we get it. That's why Big Brother is working night and day to get rid of all those old, boring, hard to understand books and replace them with simpler ones.

5. What makes those books simpler? It's not just the ideas in them, but also the words themselves! All new books are written in Newspeak, a brand-new, easy to understand language perfect for the man or woman on the go.

4. All of this sounds great, but what if your neighbor doesn't agree? He could cause trouble for himself, for you, and your community. Thankfully, Big Brother has set up a hotline, so that you can all do your part to keep our nation happy.

3. If your kids want to grow up just like you, they don't have to wait. Our nation's children are some of our best observers, and the hotline isn't limited to just adults calling in. In fact, Big Brother has set up some fantastic after-school programs designed specifically for training our youth to better recognize threats to our security.

2. Sure, normal crime is easy to spot, but what if your neighbor is just thinking about crime, but hasn't done it yet? That's where the Thought Police comes in. Our revolutionary system of law allows Big Brother to prosecute even those who haven't made their threats against us reality yet.

1. Big Brother loves you. He loves you like no one else can. You love him too. Right?",Blees-o-tron

Crap. I guess that post from two months ago finally got tapped out. I was proud of that one, not many had heard of Nanking massacre and there were a few really enlightening discussions in the comments.

I'd tried a few others since then: the Ecuadorian-Peruvian border battle, Somalia's CIA trained standing army, Afghanistan, but nothing - no one was biting and I gave up altogether.

With nothing else to do I grabbed my jacket and scheduled a meeting with Tony, my coordinator, who was in the area. He met me by the Mario statue in park green, and offered me a tuna sandwich. I ate it gratefully.

""It's not that difficult you know"" he said, pulling out a bong and lighting it. ""People only really want to hear the same thing rehashed again, it doesn't need to be OC - the supreme court ruled out on that one.""

""I know man, I know"" I said, taking a big gulp of the sandwich, ""it's just... I can't do it - it feels like I'd lose all sense of my self if I did it.""

He took another hit and lent back on the bench. ""Aaaaah, see that's your problem right there - you treat your online persona as your true persona. They're two different things; as long as you say the right thing online you can do more or less whatever you want with your personal life.""

I gave him a look that only a longtime 4channer could give. ""No... man. It's freer out there than it is here."" I didn't point, but I indicated the camera's planted in the park and the Pepsi-sponsored water fountain in the centre of the park. He either ignored my sentiment, or didn't care.

""Just post something about Jennifer Lawrands or Shia LePoof. Easy. Money.""

He'd done talking and I knew it, so I just nodded and finished my sandwich as fast as I could. ""Thanks Tony"" I said, gesturing to go. He held me back by the sleeve and looked at me soberly. 

""Listen, you're the only red mark on my list of clients. I need a good record this year. People are counting on it, ya hear?""

My heart sunk a little at that. I'd known Tony for maybe 5 years now, he was always fairly down to earth and did the job more out of obligation rather than any motivation. I now sensed a deep longing for promotion within him. Things with his new girlfriend must be getting serious.

I nodded again. ""Okay. No worries man,  tell Christie I said hi""

""I will. Take care.""

I headed back home and logged into reddit. I wrote a piece on the Ukraine crisis a decade earlier from a Russian standpoint. No votes, but I was to rectify that. Starting up my tor I jumped into 4chan.

Me: ""Anon, I need to pay the rent.""  
4chan: ""What do you need Anon.""  
Me: ""Up votes. You all game?""  
4chan: ""Reddit? Fuck you normie scum.""  
Me: ""I'll split the karma for all who vote in the first hour.""  
4chan: ""&gt;SAVEZ THE WORLD. Destabilize Reddit with upvotes? Joke.""  
Me: ""If it's consistent, they'll be forced to take the stuff we say seriously.""  
4chan: ""Well I'm in if they're not. Try at least.""  
Me: ""Thanks Anon. Will return .""

My vote jumped from 1 upvote to 25 in that hour. I watched the normal traffic promote it even more as it gained attention and reached the front page. 3200 upvotes. Between 25 people that was about 130 Karma a piece. Definitely pay the rent this month at least.

Taylor, unable to enjoy this spectacular view, put his head in his hands as the familiar smell of noodles filled the air.

""They're getting close to ready, should I use the last two eggs in them?""

Taylor felt a little sick. Eating noodles for the fifth time this week sounded dreadful. ""No. No, lets save those for tomorrow morning. Is that okay with you?""

""Yeah.""

Looking up into the dimly lit bathroom mirror, Taylor rubbed his hands through his beard which now reached down to his thin, malnourished stomach and consulted his reflection, ""Tomorrow is the first. You're only 2456 points away from rent. It'll be worth it in the end."" He was tired of sweating at constant. He was tired of being called out for being unoriginal.

""Hey! Turn those out!"" The large man stood uncomfortably close as Milo turned his pockets inside out, to ensure that he did as he was told. The man stepped a few paces back after his curiosity was satisfied, but he still watched Milo with an expression of dumb sureness.

""Tell me, Milo. How long has it been since your accident just outside the Belt?"" Milo stood in a lavish office. Across the broad, polished desk was a man some 20 years older, tall and sinister, reclining expectantly. Behind him was a window, beyond which was a vast expanse of dark sea, but no fish or animals ever swam by.

""About three years, Valko,"" Milo answered.

""I am sorry to hear about that unfortunate incident. I'm surprised that you are still in good health, I saw the wreckage myself."" He motioned towards the woman and the bear-like person that made Valko's men so uneasy. ""You keep interesting company these days. You always did. What was the name of that friend of yours, the one who helped you kidnap my beloved citizens?""

""His name was Ryan.""

""And what became of Ryan? How is he doing?"" 

Anger flashed across Milo's face. ""He died when you blew up our ship, Vaughn.""

""Oh."" Vaughn Valko's face contorted with surprise and pleasure. ""That really is a surprise. I had assumed that he survived, since you had.""

""He sacrificed himself so that me and the refugees could make it out alive,"" Milo said, his tone becoming heavy with ire.

""What a funny word to call those people,"" quipped Valko, his lip curling into a slight, crooked smirk.

""What else would you call them? Do you think the people here want to live in a run-down, diseased city at the bottom of an ocean, forced to make your drugs?"" Milo was visibly outraged. He clenched his fist. *Damn you!* he thought. *Damn you for taking this colony hostage, and damn me for helping you.*

""Why would you turn on me, Milo?"" Valko asked sorely.

""I didn't know you were going to do... *this*."" Milo furrowed his brow. ""These people don't deserve this. They weren't entirely innocent, but... Now they're addicted to your Euphoria just so they can deal with the misery of your entrapment. They survive on the scraps from the government's aid you can't be bothered to eat. They're torn from their families on Earth and Mars! Dammit, parts of Vostok are sinking into the sea!""

""Let's be honest, Milo, no one wants to live on Earth, and no one really does. This place isn't *that* bad, not as bad as Earth, anyway."" Valko turned his chair slightly. ""I didn't bring you here to discuss Vostok's state of affairs, and I'm sure you didn't come here to talk, either. So tell me what this is and how you got it."" Valko gestured towards the small black metal box on the desk. ""Is this how your ship cut so close to Jupiter and intercepted Europa? Is this how you maneuvered so aptly?""

Milo's face hardened, expressionless.

""Don't play games with me, boy!"" Valko leaned forward, his knuckles blanched white on the desk. ""Those eggheads told me that with the trajectory data from your -- "" Valko flicked a pointed finger in the air "" -- ship's computer you had to have dipped into the atmosphere of Jupiter to get here! Now, they went over every inch of that antique ship of yours and *this* is the only thing they have never seen before.""

Valko assailed the top of the box rhythmically with his overly straightened finger. ""*What* could this be? Hm?!"" He sat back in his chair, crossing a leg.

How is Angelina going to take this? She has waited for her prince to come free her for a long time. A good story rarely ends with I sad heroine. But hey, I got it. I can fix this. It has worked before. I can do it again. Luckily this time, the heroine is a beauty. 9.2/10. Last time I had to return home to a sad old woman who had been waiting for 30 years for her man.

All right, just gonna make this interworldlyportal over here function again. 

Swuirp. Takka taa. (portal sound)

Ok, I’m in now. Don’t you worry, dear reader, I’ll keep you updated with my thoughts as I go. This place really looks shitty. I think I need some cleaning assistants in my future stories. Huge abandoned castles don’t deal well with aging. Spider webs everywhere. The grayish dust on the floor is painting my footsteps as I leave them. All plants are fake. Wtf I thought I had solved this plant problem last when I discovered it first time.

But anyways, I’m going to find the princess. She should be just down here. How would she know which hero that did all the killing and mystery solving?

I have found my way to the staircase leading up the tower, where I know Angelina is kept locked in. As I ascend up the stairs I start to feel, what is awaiting me at the end of the steps, in my pants.

Outside the blue sky is following me through the small windows spiraling up the tower. I gotta say. Even with a layer of dust, white marble and sunlight still looks fabulous. Or maybe it’s just my euphoria.
I’m at the door now. Solid iron it seems.

Knock, knock.

Knock.

“Who’s there,” a feminine voice whispers.

I’m Prince Garlican, I have come to save you. Please open up the door.”

“I can’t, it’s locked. I am being held hostage, you know.”

“The key? Oh, Shit.  Julian had it on him.”

“Who’s Julian?”

[WP] The main character is dead. The narrator is to replace them. All hail the narrator!,AgentNukethisplease,"Last time on SPIES IN SPAAAAAAACE…

As you'll recall, when we last saw our valiant hero, tasked with obtaining critical information needed for the victory of the rebels over the evil empire, he was trapped on board a burning spaceship filled with deadly toxic vapors escaping from the leaking coolant lines on his dangerously overloaded star drive engines as they struggled to resist letting his vessel be pulled into the pulverizing grip of a black hole. 

Even if he somehow escaped this fate, he would still have to face the overwhelming military force of an imperial star cruiser seventy times his size and with an entire armada's worth of laser guided nuclear weaponry waiting to blast him into a highly plasmified cloud. Still worse, this cruiser was commanded by none other that our hero's arch nemesis, Baron Von Cruk, who still wants our hero dead, dead, DEAD! over a perceived insult to Cruk's mother.

**How will our hero escape this time?**

And now: the conclusion...

DANGEROUS SPACES - PART II

Space Spy Jared's X-1 cruiser screamed and whined as the engines reached critical strain levels. Breaker after breaker tripped, preventing the dangerous overloads that would otherwise send dramatic but dangerous explosions rippling through the consoles across the bridge. Sadly, Jared was just now realizing that having cleverly installed circuit breakers to protect himself from dangerous overloads was in itself sort of inconvenient in a life threatening situation as it meant he now had no working consoles left with which to control the vessel.

The black hole continued its inexorable pull and the engines whining rose to a tortured scream. Jared staggered as he attempted to reach the oxygen mask to mitigate the effects of the choking fumes from the spilled coolant that were rapidly filling the bridge. All looked bleak, and then, at the last possible second...

A single laser cannon shot from Baron Von Cruk's cruiser weakened a key structural support causing Jared's X-1 to separate at the engine compartment. Helped along by the ultra-massive pressures previously built up within the chamber, the resulting explosion tore the vessel into glowing fragments that scattered a burning cloud of plasma along a streaking arc destined to spiral toward the black hole and...

.

Uh. Wait a minute. I'm not seeing the escape pod, folks. Hmm. Maybe I missed it? Just a second. Let me just look a little more carefully here. No. Definitely not. Well, huh. Hang on a second. Let me use my omniscient narrator powers to scan for signs of... nope. No teleport beam either. Huh. I got a bad feeling about this.

Folks: This is kind of awkward, and I don't know how to say it, but I think Jared is dead. No. Really, really ... dead. Yeah, I know. I can't quite believe it either. I mean, this is usually the part where the hero comes up with some insanely improbable way of surviving that you never saw coming, or maybe some *deus ex machina* pops up out of thin air — well, you know: thin space in this case — but you know what I mean.

Nope. Just not happening. Oh God! My narrator senses are detecting organic residue in the cloud. Oh, ick. It's Jared. Yeah, definitely. I just saw a trace of DNA for just a second before the last of it burned up. Oh man. This sucks. This really sucks.

Geez, Jared. So sorry buddy. I guess we finally asked too much of you. The writing staff has really been working you into tighter and tighter corners lately, but I never thought they'd take it this far. I should have known, I guess. All the mean jokes in the break room during the late night re-writes. Tony and Eleanor have both said they could get a better gig than this, but we all thought they were just blowing off steam, you know?

But what bugs me is that Baron Von Cruk and his masters at the evil empire are going to take over the galaxy. Without that critical information you were trying to obtain, I just don't see how the rebels can avoid being wiped out. You were their last hope, dude. 

Unless...

Wait! No! That's totally crazy. Me? I couldn't very well... I'm the *narrator* for crying out loud! I'm not supposed to... Well, now that I think of it, I *do* have omniscient narrator senses, and since I manifest as a disembodied voice I'm pretty much invisible. I could go anywhere and obtain pretty much any info I wanted.

Yeah. Why not? Now that I think about it, I'd make a better spy then you, Jared. Oh I know that look you'd be giving me right now if you were here. That disbelieving look that anyone but you could be the galaxy's most dangerous spy. Well see here, Jared: you're DEAD. That's how good a spy *you* were. I double dog *dare* them to kill of the narrator! What do you think of that Jared? Oh — *nothing* because you're *dead*. 

Honestly. How hard can it be? I'll just start by narrating about Baron Von Cruk's departing cruiser. There it is now. Now I'll zoom inside and narrate about how the Baron toys with his villainous mustachio and laughs evilly while he enjoys the final fate of the late lamented ex-spy Jared. Next I'll narrate about how his second in command gives the coordinates to rendezvous with the imperial fleet. 

Aha! Got it! Got the coordinates for the rendezvous point. Oh yeah. Piece of cake. Now, wasting no time, I fast forward ahead to scout out the imperial fleet in search of the hidden weaknesses that the great *Jared* didn't live long enough to discover. 

Who the hero now, Jared? That's right: *me*. The Narrator.

[WP] The main character is dead. The narrator is to replace them. All hail the narrator!,AgentNukethisplease,"Captain Jack Gallant dashed across the war-torn and scarred battlefield, keeping his head low to avoid any stray blaster bolts.  His coat flapped behind him as he ran, the active camouflage patterns shifting in an attempt to keep up with his changing surroundings.

He gritted his teeth as he skidded to a stop behind a boulder.  He counted at least four Xorg walkers, and they knew that he'd made it out of the flaming wreckage of his own ship.  He was alone, outnumbered, and without any way to contact his own soldiers.

Not that it would do him much use, he thought blackly to himself.  They didn't have the manpower to spare for a rescue.

Reaching under his coat, he pulled his ion pistol free of its holster.  Counting the extra batteries he always kept in his pockets, he figured that he could maybe bring down two, possibly three of the Xorg walkers.  

He took a deep breath, gathering air into his lungs.  He would only get one shot at this; he'd need to stay in constant motion.  A battle cry springing to his lips, he leapt up from behind the boulder-

-and a high-energy laser burst caught him directly in the chest, reducing most of his internal organs to charcoal.

Captain Jack Gallant died instantly, toppling down to the ground.

Yep, he's still dead.  

Still dead.

Dead guy, over here.  Just lying there on the ground.  Not really doing anything.  Not much for me to narrate, here.

Wait.

I just said me.

Oh crap, I did it again.  Balls!  This isn't good - I'm breaking the cardinal rule of narration!  They always told me (blast, did it again!) that this would implode the whole story, ruin the whole universe.

Any second now.  Universe about to explode.  Or implode, I can never remember which way is which.  One of them goes into a small thing, I remember.  The other one goes out in a big boom.

Universe still hasn't whatever-ploded.  Well, with the time left, let's have some fun!

The body of Captain Jack Gallant suddenly stirred, moved by no breeze- no, wait, I never liked Captain Jack.  His inner thoughts were always far too smug.  

Suddenly, out of nowhere, Will the cabin boy appeared!  He, of course, looked totally confused, as would anyone who just appeared out of thin air after dying only two hours previously in a tragic spaceship crash.

Will stared down at himself, touching his body, as if he couldn't believe he was real.  ""This can't be happening,"" he muttered.  ""I died - I remember, the fire - thinking that maybe I would see Donna again in Heaven...""

Oh yeah, Donna.  The Space Princess that Will fell hopelessly head over heels for, a couple books previously.  Hell, let's summon her up too, shall we?

Will turned as he caught the motion out of the corner of his eye, and moved forward, just in time to catch Donna as she plummeted out of the sky.  He grunted as she landed solidly in his arms, but managed to stay on his feet. 

Donna's eyes fluttered gently as she looked up, into Will's smiling face.  ""Will?"" she asked drowsily, reaching up and draping her own arms around his neck.  ""Oh, I had such an unpleasant dream.  Make it all better,""

""Nothing will separate us again,"" Will vowed, bending down to kiss her full, slightly parted lips-

-as another laser burst shredded them both into chunks of bloody tissue.

God dammit!  I forgot about the stupid Xorg walkers.  Ugh.  Shoddy narration, this is.  I'd be fired on my first day if this was the kind of game I brought most days.

Screw it.  A snap echoed through the air, and all four Xorg walkers exploded, their fusion cores all spontaneously over-firing and going critical at the same time.  Shrapnel littered the ground.

But with the destruction of the Xorg came a fine mist, a magical fairy dust- no, even better!  The life force of the Xorg empire, soaking into the remains of Will and Donna!

Oh, and Captain Jack, too, I suppose.  Ugh.  Stupid guy can't even stay dead.

In a totally logical and not made up at all fashion, the fine mist restored the captain, the Space Princess, and the cabin boy back to their living selves.  Grunting, Will pulled himself up to his feet, bending down to help Donna up a moment later.  Her gold robes were torn and her hair a mess, but she still looked every inch the noble princess.

""Now, where was I?"" Will grinned, as his lips finally met hers.

Captain Jack frowned as he watched his former cabin boy embrace the space princess.  ""I thought I end up with the girl,"" he muttered, scratching at his head.

Will and Donna, however, paid no attention to him.  In fact, they threw themselves into their kissing with such fervor that the entire sun could have exploded, and they wouldn't have noticed.  Still in each other's arms, they sank down to the ground, Will laying down with Donna atop him.  His hands slid up the sides of her dress, tracing the fine curves of her body beneath the sheer fabric.  His fingers closed on the zipper, tugging it down, inch by gentle inch.  

The zipper reluctantly parted, revealing smooth skin as the dress fell away from her.  She brushed it off of porcelain bare shoulders, revealing the swell of a perfectly round and formed-

-and the entire universe imploded into a single speck.

Dammit.  I was nearly there!  

Oh well, nothing to see here.  Pack it in, folks.  I'll, uh, just be headed out then.

[WP] The main character is dead. The narrator is to replace them. All hail the narrator!,AgentNukethisplease,"It was then, that, finally building up enough courage to touch the handle, Steven decided it was the right time to finally open the door. He stepped, barefoot, onto the wet tile in his bathroom and looked up, expecting for an ambush.  Seeing it was clear, took another step.  He gripped the makeshift club, a month old magazine twisted into a tube shape.

“Where’s that fucking spider?” He said, under his breath, embarrassed at his own situation.  “Where are you, you ugly bitch?” He said, slightly louder, hoping to scare the spider out of its hiding spot.  He once heard that dogs only bark when they’re attempting to flush prey out of brush and, well, he kind of assumed he maybe was doing the same.

Swinging the door closed, Steven raised the magazine high, anticipating the spider to be on the other side.  “Phew,” he let out a heavy sigh.  After checking the sink and behind the toilet, there was just one place left.  Steven stood up from the floor and slipped on the wet tile and smashed his temple into the toilet, instantly breaking his neck.  He walked over to the curtain and-

Wait.  What?  What did I just say?

“Instantly breaking his neck.”  No.  Wait.  That’s… uh.  That’s not supposed to… 

Ahem.  So.

Wait, is anybody listening to me?  This is still act one.  He’s still got the scene with the girl at the end, he can’t die.  This… Is this the right story?  Uh, just… hold on… Scroll down a bit.  Or swipe, or whatever. Let me try something, look away for a few paragraphs.  

“And then, Steven was all better and stood up.”

…

Nope.

Uh.

“And then he got up.”

“Shit, fuck goddamn-

Oh.  Hey.  Yeah, I’m here….

OK, so… Uh… Let’s just cut to….the…park

*The scene switched to Central Park in New York City, on a summer evening.*

Woah, OK, who is that talking, now?

 *As James stood before Melonie she held James’ hand, as the two walk through the park together.*

Woah, James?  I’m James, that’s my name.  I’m…  I’m the main character now?

 “What’s the matter, James?” Melonie noticed James in distress.

“I…,” *James held his head, rubbing his temples.* “I’m not sure.  I feel like something’s wrong…”

“Is it your headaches, again?” *Melonie pulled out a small pill bottle from the front of James’ fanny pack, she then reached into her own backpack and pulled out a bottle of water*. “Here you go, sweetie,” she handed the pills to James.

“No,” *James pushed her hand away.*  Stop that.  No…*James thought to himself.* 
You’re taking away my omniscience.

“Come on, Steven” *Melonie handed the pills back to him.* “Take it now, before it gets worse.”

“What gets worse?” *James rubbed his temple again.*

“Honey,” she plopped two capsules into his palm.  James tossed them into his mouth and drank the water, swallowing the pills.  Within minutes, his headache went away and the pressure in his temples released.

“Thank you,” Steven smiled, hugging Melonie.

“Welcome back,” she kissed his cheek and placed the pills back into his fanny pack. The sun was finally setting and, as promised, Steven had walked a full three laps around the park so, hand in hand, the two headed home.

[WP] The main character is dead. The narrator is to replace them. All hail the narrator!,AgentNukethisplease,"No don't!!!

And then there, at my figurative feet, falls Henry. I stare in disbelief as I see his limbs roll over the other, and the life disappears from his eyes, staring straight at me. I... I can't believe this has happened. Just moments ago, he was sitting in his room. He seemed fine. What went wrong? What didn't I see? Did I make a mistake? Or, did Henry find a way to keep some things from me...

Hold on, I need to think about this. Just, bear with me as I recollect the past, well, everything that's led up to this.

Ok, I guess today is the best place to begin. This morning, where was Henry? Asleep? No, no he was driving home. Yeah that's when I first started narrating him. Ok so he's driving home, and, and, and he gets a text from Andrea. ""I hope you die!!"" Andrea! What an awful thing to say to Henry! Henry just stares at the text, sitting at the morning traffic light. And then he mindlessly puts it down on the passenger seat. Wait, Henry, doesn't that hurt you? Why didn't you get angry, or text her back? Maybe this goes deeper than I first thought. Maybe, hey! The light turns green and Henry speeds through the intersection. Hey! *cough cough* Slow down!

Henry pulls up against his apartment complex, doing a shitty job at parking might I add. He hops out of the car and jumps the staircases up to the door. He unlocks the door and pushes it open, only to be met with a stubborn door. He shoulder rams the wooden rectangle. Still stuck. He takes a few steps back, then drop kicks his entrance open. Henry's suddenly fuming now. With heavy steps he walks through the entry hallway, throwing the table scraps down the hall, then proceeds to knock over the coat rack. Henry. He then steps right, into the small living room. Adrenaline-filled, he sheers the coffee-tableware up into the air and fireplace. He then jaggedly steps to the street-facing window and rips the curtains, rod and all, bare from the wall and onto the floor in a violent *kashink* and *thud*. Henry? And in a final bout of strength, he lifts the solid wood coffee-table up to his forehead and careens it into the flat-screen. The table makes an awful crash against the floor, and the TV quickly sparks, then unsuccessfully remains connected to the wall, and it too falls to the floor.

Henry? No response. Henry? Henry can you hear me? Are you ok? ... If you can hear me, what happened earlier?

Henry walks to the kitchen in the back of the apartment. I look around the living room. The bright moon and fireplace light the space rather well. A few magazines from the entryway lay under the now upside-down coffee-table. The curtains, though strewn violently before, softly drape the corner potted plant next to the window. And there, in the fireplace, I see a now half-burned piece of paper. The paper, which I assume to be a letter, then suddenly becomes consumed by the comfy inferno, but just before it burns I make out the word ""custody"" at the top.

I am lost in my thoughts for a moment, but not before a cough from Henry jolts me back. I see through the small passageway, Henry sits at the two-chaired dinner table, sloppily eating a sandwich. Not sure what kind, but the open peanut-butter on the counter gives a good clue. He must have scarfed too much at once, though, because he quickly exaggerates his coughing fit. He sets the sandwich down and with two long steps reaches at the sink nozzle and sprays water into his mouth. Poor guy forgot a drink. He then musters a slight growl and forces the barely-chewed bite down his throat. His arms outstretched against the counter, Henry takes a few deep breaths. He seems calmer after a few moments. That's good. If my memory is correct, though I wasn't even aware I actually had one, Henry next goes upstairs and lies down for a bi- Henry turns around and piano-fingering the air, grips the large steak knife and holds it into the air. Oh, yeah, I forgot about that.

He leaves the kitchen and goes upstairs. In front of the top step, he nudges his bedroom door as it wasn't fully closed. He flips the lights on, and plops himself down onto the bed. Trash, and OH that *stench*- wrappers and assorted packaging litters the carpet, a few spots thinner than others, but almost no strand of the soft floor peeks through. And Henry seems to be trying to melt into his mattress. What a roller-coaster this guy has gone through in just half-an-hour. Not that I didn't see all of this the first time, just, these kinds of stories don't end like how it did.

Henry continues to lay in his bed, twisting the tip of knife against his index finder, gently spinning the whole of the knife sideways, like a rotisseries chicken, with his right hand. And then I hear something. And it appears Henry doesn't. I turn around, look down the stairs, and straight down to the front door, I see that it's fully open. Or was it open after Henry kicked it in? I'm not too for sure to be honest. So I proceed to go down the stairs, through the entry way, and as I peer out to the streets, I see nothing. I guess it was already open and I hadn't noticed. As I start to turn my head back, a light comes from inside Henry's car. His phone. I go down to the car, and look through the window. ""3 missed calls"". Those must be from Andrea. Hey Henry! I shout up to the house. Then I remember he can't hear me.

But I swear this isn't how it happened before. Didn't Andr-... I then go straight back to Henry's room. I stand next to the window opposite his open bedroom door, next to his bed. The front door *was* closed before. And now stands Andrea in Henry's doorway. Henry seems almost oblivious to her presence. I swap glances between them both. I don't know what I expected to happen the last time I saw this, and I'm not sure I can do anything but watch it all over again. Henry then almost instinctively stands up, and steps to look out the window. He and I are now next to each other. I use all of my narrative strength to will Henry into safety, but I am just the narrator, not the writer. Andrea raises a gun, and aims it at Henry. ""You know what to do,"" Henry says, now the second time I'm hearing this.

And then, *bang*

And so Henry's body falls to the floor again. And once again I am saddened. But if I could do it before, then I can do it again. And so for the third time, Henry receives the hateful text from Andrea. And again it is early in the morning. And again, I scour each scene for something new. That bouquet of flowers in the back seat- I hadn't noticed that before...

So I twisted the prompt a tad, if you couldn't tell.

[WP] The main character is dead. The narrator is to replace them. All hail the narrator!,AgentNukethisplease,"How did I get here? It was all going so well and then, well, the script went awry and Quentin was in a spot of trouble. Backed against the impossible, he did the only thing any main character would do.

Burst into tears and die.

There was already a back log of stories to narrate and now that I had screwed up the top writer's story, I knew I was going to be fired in a matter of time. I sat back, gazing at the world I had spent hours introducing, building and orchestrating. Moving Quentin around the story had been a pain in the ass because the writer had made him have the personality of a stubborn and unmoving rock. 

I mean, it wasn't too bad, I've had worse, especially when I first started this job. I was still a junior narrator and I spent hours narrating children's books. I had wanted to quit almost immediately, simply due to the sheer boredom that was involved with narrating the *The Adventures of Gigi the Cat*. Somehow, management had noticed that my total apathy at narrating was perfect for directing and narrating young adult novels. It was an interesting genre, full of unique concepts, but the creep of the dystopias began growing and soon it was the only type of novel I was working with. 

""I guess we have to make money someway, if not we wouldn't have jobs..."" 

Wait. I could speak. That was not normal. When I narrated, I would project the words as I thought of them to the front of my head and the words would speak in a booming, omnipotent tone. This was not a divine voice however, it was rather... *regular*. 
I checked my watch, still two hours before the editors would check in with my progress. I began panicking,

""When they find out that Quentin died and that I completely destroyed the head writer's pet project, and, and, when they find out I can speak, oh there will be hell to pay..."" I had begun mumbling and after a few seconds I paused, looked down at Quentin's lifeless corpse,

""HOW COULD I FUCK UP SO BADLY?!"" I screamed,

Wait now I can swear as well? What the hell is going on? I looked down at the table in front of me and sifted through the papers for the manual. I pushed aside the volumes for time control and character etiquette before accidentally causing a stack of books to fall off the table. Paper was thrown up in all directions and the volumes made resounding thuds as they hit the ground. I slumped back into my chair. 

""What's the point?"" I muttered, ""I'm gonna be fired anyways...""

I sighed and leaned forward towards the table before noticing the script. On the page were the words,

""Act 2""

I picked up the script and flipped to the next page where upon I was greeted by the lines,

""Quentin (Pitiful begging): Argh no, please, I beg you, please!
Quentin dies a gruesome death.

A long pause.

The narrator is now the main character.

Narrator (Screaming): Quentin, NO!""

I looked up and there I was, directly in front of Quentin's still lifeless corpse. No table, no papers and no script. That would have been rather peculiar if I didn't start screaming.",Potatosaladnuke

He charged in towards the demon lord, using all of his strength. The demon lord's eyes widened for a moment, but he quickly regained his composure.

""You fool! I've been terrorizing the entire world, and you think that is enough to defeat me?!""

Of course, he didn't know about the heroes secret spell. The hero grinned, and ran right into the demon lord's sword.

Blood started dripping from his stomach, and he looked up at the demon lord with a look of confusion.

""How.. could this.. happen?""

The demon sword pulled back his sword, and the hero fell limply to the ground. There was now doubt that he was dead.

WHAT?!

YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DIE HERE!! YOU HAD A SECRET SPELL PREPARED TO DEFEAT THE DEMON LORD!! WHY DIDN'T YOU USE IT?!

Oh sorry, just got a little surprised there. I guess I'll need to find a new hero to follow, considering that the previous one was incompetent.

Me? No, I could never be a hero. Not that I would mind, I just don't have what it takes. I doubt I could last more than five minutes against the demon lord.

Wait, why are you pulling out a knife and pointing it toward me? And why do you have a spare set of armor and weapons with you? Wait, did you predict that this would happen? But why me? And why aren't you giving me a choice?

Oh, we don't have time for the whole refusing the call ordeal? Well, if I don't have any choice, I guess I'll go.

*****

On the way to the demon lord's castle, I met many companions, and got many followers. People referred to me as 'the narrator', as I knew the secrets of every character I met. And after half-a-year of traveling, I finally arrived at the gates of the demon lord's castle. When I arrived, I turned to my companions and spoke.

""Sorry, but I can't have you follow me any further.""

As expected this was met with protests. Still, since I knew that the castle is surrounded by an area spell that slowly drives the people inside insane, I didn't really see any other option. I had seen the previous hero's companions slowly go insane, and the hero had only gotten by because the hero is granted immunity to mind spells.

I do not have that advantage, considering that I'm not a hero. If I were to guess how long I could hold out, I would say at least 30 minutes, and an hour at maximum.

Still facing my companions, I took out a scroll and pointed the side with the text towards my companions. And then I teared it into two.

A huge wall of earth shot up in front of me, separating me from my companions. With that, I turned around, and headed into the castle.

*****

Castle makes it sound like a really big facility, but the only two rooms that really mattered was the throne room and the room next to it.

The previous hero's party had cleared out everything, and for some reason, the demon lord hadn't bothered getting new guards. If I were to guess, I'd say that he got some elite guards, and he didn't have much money after investing in them, so he skimped out on regular guards. Typical demon lord arrogance.

Still, it gave me a good chance to check over my equipment. I had my armor and sword, and I'd become decent at using them. In addition, I had three 'arrow hell' spells, two 'acceleration' spells, and one 'inferno' spell. They were all scrolls, as I had no natural magical ability. When I entered, I had also activated a clock spell that showed me how long I'd been inside. It currently said 04:49.

As I turned the last corner before the throne room, I saw a figure in front of me. I recognized the shadow instantly. It was obvious why the demon lord hadn't bothered to hire any extra guards. After all, he had the best fighter in the land. 

It was the hero. A demon lord using necromancy shouldn't surprise anyone, so in retrospect, I shouldn't have been caught off-guard. 

In the time I was shocked, the hero had already charged and swung his sword. He was aiming for a gap in my armor at my left shoulder. I tried to bring up my sword to block, but I realized that it wouldn't be quick enough. Instead, I took a sidestep to the left and received it with my helm. Definitely not my best idea, but it was better than starting to bleed before I faced the demon king.

I took one of my 'acceleration' scrolls and used it to send myself backwards, and away from the hero. It ended with me crashing into a wall, but I was barely able to stay conscious. I really shouldn't try to be a hero.

I saw the hero coming towards me, but I cast 'arrow hell' while breathing heavily to keep the hero preoccupied. 

I used the small recovery period to process the situation. I had used two of six spells, and recieved some bad damage in the process. The clock also said 17:23, so I should probably try to avoid this fight.

Having gathered my thoughts, I activated another 'arrow hell' to send arrows towards the hero, and to force him in towards the wall on the left side. Once he reached the wall, I cast another 'arrow hell', to force him into the corner the furthest away from the throne room.

Once he was there I cast my last 'acceleration' to speed past him and into the throne room. I remember the feeling of having outwitted the hero, even if said hero was dead. Well, I was actually outwitted by him.

""'FORCE MOVE'""

Right. The hero's trump card, that he for some reason didn't use against the demon lord. One of the most powerful spells in existence, since it can force a person to do anything, except for killing themselves. Right in front of the door to the throne room, I turned around and charged towards the hero.

While I was holding my sword in both hands above my head, the hero put his sword in front of him, making sure I would collide with it. Kind of funny if you think about it. I'd die the same way as the hero, a reckless charge into the enemy's sword.

Like hell I would let that happen. I had intended to use it against the demon lord, but beggars can't be choosers. I shouted with all my strength.

""'INFERNO'""

Fire engulfed the entire room. Normally, the flames would only fly from the part of the scroll that contains writing, but since the scroll was rolled up, it flew in every direction.

The end result was a burnt hero falling to the ground. I did of course not escape unharmed, but I had prepared some fire resistant clothing, considering that I was dealing with fire spells.

The clock said 25:32.

Not much time left.

I had less than five minutes to defeat the strongest creature known to man. In addition, I was covered in wounds from the previous battle.

Those were my thoughts as I stumbled through the gate to the throne room.

[WP] The main character is dead. The narrator is to replace them. All hail the narrator!,AgentNukethisplease,"What did I do to deserve this? I was just doing my job, narrating this movie, when all of a sudden Jake got stabbed. Jake, the main character of this movie. Doesn't the main character never die? Isn't that an unwritten rule? You couldn't kill the main character! 

""Oops,"" muttered Hypno, the villain. Everyone, friend and foe(whoever's point of view you're looking from. The currently stone dead main character? The stupid villain who STABBED Jake, THE CURRENTLY STONE DEAD MAIN CHARACTER?!) stopped battling and stared at the stone cold dead(DEAD!) body of the main character.

""Goll, boss, you've screwed up now,"" someone said.

Hypno whipped around, his eyes glowing. ""I didn't mean to!""

Everyone instantly broke out into panicked chatter.

""He killed Jake.""

""No, it can't be.""

""But this wasn't planned.""

""We were never supposed to stab him in the heart, at least.""

""Wait, is he really dead? Someone check him.""

""Yep, he's dead.""

Finally, I couldn't take it. 

My voice boomed out from... well, somewhere.

""Oh just stop it. Let's all think this through.""

... Well, that was what I planned to say, but what actually came out was:

""Goddammit Hypno, can't do a single thing right?""

Everyone shut up instantly, for a few reasons. It's not natural to hear me boom out such a line.

At this point, you should have already guessed it, but I'll say it. I am the narrator of this story. Or, well, *ex*-narrator. But we'll get to that later.

Anyway.

Hypno's face flushed(whaddya expect? A 14-year-old kid, is all that he is). He began to start shouting at me, before another voice, even louder than mine, muttered a curse.

Now, I mean swearing, of course.

""W-who's that?"" Hypnos asked.

""Search me,"" I reply, slightly in awe.

""We can't. You don't have a physical body,"" Hypnos replied.

""Of all times to be snarky, Hypnos. Why I ougtha-""

""Shut it,"" the voice boomed out again. It sighed and began muttering to itself. ""What to do, what to do...""

""Um, excuse me?"" I ask tentatively.

""Hm?""

""Wh-who are you, exactly?""

""I'm the author, for gall sake.""

Some of the crewman recoiled. Gall, goll, and the like were their slang.

""Goll, what to do...""

""Couldn't you just reverse it?"" I asked hopefully. ""Like erase it? Or backspace? Or-""

""I'm using a typewriter, Narrator.""

""O-oh."" I shut up. Something in his voice told me not to argue.

The voice sighed again and after a while of utter silence, it spoke up. ""Right, I've figured it out. This is halfway through the story, and our hero has been killed. So, we need another main character to replace him. And the candidate is...""

Everyone looked at each other, puzzled and a little hopeful. After all, I suppose, one would kill to be the main character. 

Whoops.

""NARRATOR!"" the voice rang throughout the entire universe of the story.

""Do you really think this is a good idea Mary?""

She gave him the knowing look that made his stomach churn. It wasn't long after one of those looks he was explaining to all of his friends and family that his betrothed was pregnant because of ""a miracle of god"".

""Joseph, Jesus has been running all over the country side with his friends and if we can't be there to guide him we have to equip him with the proper knowledge,"" She said.

She couldn't see Joseph roll his eyes as he ran his hands over the furniture he'd been working on, checking for burs.

Jesus came into the room, ""Mother, Joseph how are you?""

Mary ran to give Jesus a hug, ""Sweet Jesus, you smell a bit son, when was the last time you bathed?""

Jesus waved his hand dismissively ""Oh mother, I've been very busy."" His attention turned ""Would you two like some wine?"" Jesus reached for the water vessel.

Joseph lunged across the room, grabbing Jesus arm, ""No, no. The water is just fine son. Your mother and I asked you here for a reason. Please sit down, we have something important to tell you about.""

Jesus looked at Mary, ""What's up mom?""

Mary placed her arm on Jesus' shoulder, ""Honey, you're thirty years old now, and you've been travelling a lot with your friends...""

""My apostles,"" Jesus interrupted.

""Yes of course honey."" said Marry. She continued, ""It's just that you are out in the world, spending a lot of time on your own and we thought it was important that you learn about sex.""

Jesus face turned red and he laughed awkwardly, ""Uh, mom you don't have to worry, I know about sex.""

The look of relief on Joseph's face was palpable, ""Thank goodness, when your mother told me we had to tell you about where babies come from I nearly had a heart attack!""

Jesus face became puzzled, ""I know that I was born because my dad, you know, God, made mom pregnant with me, But what does sex have anything to do with babies?""

Mary and Joseph stared at each other a moment.

Mary turned back to Jesus, ""Honey you're the only baby that God made...""

Joseph's eyes rolled again.

Mary continued, "" But most of the time two people who love each other have sex and then they become pregnant and have a baby.""

A look of terror came over Jesus' face.

""What's wrong honey?"" She asked.

It took a moment for Jesus to speak, ""I think Matthew, Mark and Luke might be pregnant!""

But Mary would not be appeased.

34 So Joseph took the boy Jesus aside and did tell him of the birds and the bees, whereupon he said that if Jesus had any questions, he must ask them quickly, for the game was not yet over. And Jesus replied that he did have one.

*Luke 2: 46-63*

46 After three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. 47 Everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his answers. 48 When his parents saw him, they were astonished. His mother said to him, “Son, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been anxiously searching for you.”

49 “Why were you searching for me?” he asked. “Didn’t you know I had to be in my Father’s house?” 50 But they did not understand what he was saying to them.

51 Then he went down to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them. But his mother treasured all these things in her heart. 52 And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man. 

53 Readily learned in the teachings of the Lord, his mother and earthly father Joseph did decide he was of age to learn how a child was to be brought forth into the world. 54 Mary said unto him, ""Jesus, come sit by me and learn how a child is brought into this world. You are old enough to know about how a man will grind his[ mano stone](http://www.treasurenet.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=222568&amp;d=1332398517) and make the flour of life in a woman's [metate](http://www.sfu.museum/cco_images/artifacts/Medium/df_artifacts/x2002.014.001%20\(12\).jpg)."" 55 ""I do not understand,"" Jesus replied. ""Of what do you speak?"" 56 And Mary said, ""When a man loves his woman, and they wish to bring a child into our world, she must ride his proverbial donkey all the way to Bethlehem.""

57 Joseph spoke. ""Do not confuse the boy with your stories, Mary. It seems you cannot relate the facts directly when it comes to being full with child. Why do you not tell him of the time you were full with Eliezer, the stablemaster?""

58 ""I know not of what you both speak,"" Jesus pleaded. The young Christ did sense tension in the room where they sat. 

59 ""Hold your tongue, my dear husband Joseph. Speak no ill of Eliezer the stablemaster, as I have told you that he is but a good friend who is generous in his dealings,"" Mary shot back, her tongue quicker than a desert viper. 

60 Joseph laughed. ""Generous, indeed. I hear his herding staff is bigger than most men's, and his flock of sheep is but only the second largest he keeps.""

61 The boy Jesus sighed in bewilderment. ""I am learned in the teachings of our Lord, but I fail to understand the tales you now speak to me."" Jesus looked to Mary and Joseph, who only stared at each other.

62 ""Jesus, I am sure your mother can tell you so much more about the '*Lord*.' Perhaps she will tell you of how he appears to her on nights I am travelling away from town to feed our family."" 63 As Joseph spoke, he made an exaggerated motion with his hand, as if he were milking an extraordinarily large goat.

"[WP] Your teenage dreams of incredible power come true, but at a terrible price: whenever you want to use your powers, you also transform into what your 13 year old self considered cool.",FriendsCallMeAsshole,"It started 3 years ago, at first it scared the crap out of me, but after a while I realized what was happening and I came to love it. The elements came to me, did what I wanted of them, I could do anything. For the first year it was great, I was amazing at all sports, after all I could use the air itself to make every shot I made in basketball perfect.  I even saved a kid from being hit by a car, even if by accident.  But after that first year..... It all began to change.

My parents warned me about using my powers, I should have listened to them, even though I did it to be the cool one in school.  Grade 11 is hard after all, being 16 and wanting to be the popular guy.  I even used fire to set off a couple fire alarms to get out of tests!

At first, I thought it was nothing but my eczema acting up, my shoulder itched like mad, cream would only help so much with the need to itch, but wouldn't clear it up. This went on for weeks, it slowly spreading to envelop my entire shoulder.  It didn't so much itch after a while, but felt constricting, at one point limiting movement of my left arm.  

And then it happened. The skin on my shoulder split and peeled away.  I was absolutely horrified when it happened. Peeling away the sheets of skin from my shoulder it revealed something so foreign I cried out of fear.  Scales. What am I? What is happening? I ran to my parents for help but they too were horrified of what happened. 

After a week of hiding in my room, my parents came in to talk.  They told me I couldn't stay there anymore. My heart broke, but I knew they had to know.  I reached down, grabbing onto the hem of my sweatpants, and pulled it up.  My leg from my ankle all the way up to mid thigh was now scales too. Had I known what was happening then, I would have marvelled at the beauty of them.  Shimmering in the dim light, each scale the purest silver one could find, each shifting and sliding along each other as I moved, impenetrable armor.  I showed them my wrists, they too were scales, and I confessed trying to kill myself out of fear, and was unable to due to the scales breaking the blade.  They left quickly in horror, my dad muttering about how hiding me somewhere far was the only option. 

Weeks passed, and during that time I could do nothing but reflect. My door only opened when I needed to go to the bathroom or when food was left at my door.  It was then, through trial and error I discovered my powers were doing it to me.  Every time I used them, more skin would begin to peel off. ""For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.""  Newton is so right.

Three weeks had passed and my dad appeared again, throwing me a couple duffle bags telling me to pack.  He wouldn't tell me where I was going.  I packe my things that I wanted and came out of my room and downstairs. The scream of horror that escaped my mom when she saw wounded me more deeply that any injury could. Almost all scales now, I stood there staring at her with utmost sadness, but I knew why. 

Not only was it the scales, but I had started growing a tail.  It was a bit stubby, only about two feet long, but it was there.  My dad shoved me to the garage away from her, and into the back of a white van.  It was dark out, and my dad didn't want me seen.   After what seemed to be an eternity of rattling darkness, the van stopped and turned off.  

The doors flew open, and it wasn't my dad standing there, but a woman. She was short, middle aged, slightly on the bigger size and kept her greying hair up in a bun.  Modestly dressed in a t-shirt and jeans she smiled at me with the most warmest genuine smile I've seen in months by this point.  Grabbing my bags she told me to follow her. Without even acknowledging me, my dad shut the doors, jumped in and sped off.  Leaving me behind in a trail of dust.  

Trying to run after him it struck home through the tears pouring down my face.  I was being left here, abandoned by my own family.  Falling to my knees in the settling dust, the lady, Beatrice she then said her name, walked up and crouched beside me, putting a hand gently on my shoulder. She consoled me, as if I was normal and told me there were others like me with special abilities.  She told me this was a retreat for us to become what we were intended to be, and that everyone here was a weird little family, and one day that I too would hopefully at peace.  

Pushing her away I cried out in grief, pounding my fists in the ground in utmost anger then, the ground had cracked and a pillar of fire exploded around me. Beatrice backed away rather quickly, letting my frustrations and fears burn out.  The changes from the outburst didn't wait to take place this time either.  The tail grew rapidly, reaching a length of six feet, ridges starting to form along its length, but this time it was different. 

Pain.  Such intense pain burned through me.  From the tail and in my chest as things began to change inside as well.  My anger ended as quickly as it began in a shriek of anguish and pain.  Once it passed she came to me once more, helping me up and to the golf cart she used to keep up to me running.  We just sat there and she placed a gentle hand on my knee, patting it a few times.  That's when she said it, and reality hammered home, resounding through me with the peal of a monastery's bell.  ""Dragon"" she had said, and honestly that is all in able to remember of that conversation.  

That all happened what feels like years ago.  Even though it's only been 6 months, and now, Beatrice, and the other kids are all celebrating my 17th birthday. There isn't any sad faces, we're all smiling, laughing.  Even the kid turning into a Cthulhu like creature was enjoying himself.  I may be almost twelve feet tall now, but I still feel like a little kid when Beatrice is around.  We all call her little mother.  Oh! I started growing wings yesterday.  Beatrice has been helping us with our own abilities.  She is an oracle after all, teaching us how to use them very subtly to avoid the changes being painful.  She smiled when I promised to take her flying some time, the other kids like myself that can't fly want to as well.   And I've taken interest in one of the other to-be dragons. Mmm that tail.  Anyways, the two of us share a warehouse. Things are really looking up!

The  skinny officer of the watch gave his captain a truncated saluit before shuffling away, audibly yawning. It had been four months since they had set sail from Old Wyck and discipline was becoming increasingly lax even amongst the officers. The Iron Islanders were not known for iron discipline, and Kingslanders like Byteflea, Northerners, Pentoshi, Bravosi, and other greenlanders unaccustomed to properly long stints at sea weren't helping morale. Traditionally, an Ironborn Captain would remedy this through a show of strength, usually in the form of a harsh lashing of a man for a relatively minor infraction in front of his companions. Traditionally, the officers wouldn't be as disgruntled as the men. The Captain was convicted the disention in the ranks was due to it's mongrel nature: true Ironmen would leave the comfort of their homes for months at a time without a moment's hesitation. Indeed, true Ironmen would revel at the prospect, but these men... The Iron Islands had never recovered from their subjugation by the greenlanders. The Greyjoy Revolutions decimated their population and ruined their once mighty fleets. The Captain couldn't even find enough Ironmen willing to crew a single ship for this voyage. They were a broken nation, ruled by forign overlords. His people needed hope, a fresh start, something the Ironborn could take that the greenlanders couldn't take from them in turn. Something from the other edge of the world, from Asshai. Generations ago, the Captain's ancestor Euron told tales of reaching the Shadowlands in the east by sailing west. The riches of the east could be reached by sailing west, and only Ironborn could do it. If they held out that long... ""Drowned God, grant us the strength to tske what is ours,"" he murmured under his breath.

I shuddered, raising my gloved hands up as we approached the main party area. ""Don't even joke about that kind of thing, man.""

The living room was a crash of noise and motion, with friends and neighbors trying to keep the noise down to a low roar. The Sullivans, their baby girl in Marie's arms, sneered at me from across the room. She'd worn her best pants suit; Tom was wearing a vested pinstripe suit with a red power tie. It wasn't professionally-trained job pride, like what the Colvins had, that made them wear their work clothes to a five-year-old's birthday party; it was showing off, pure and simple. Fucking city councilman and surveyor for the greater Los Angeles area. And here I was in nurse's scrubs, plastic gloves, and a surgical mask, playing dress-up like I was five years old again too. 

Some of the kids were a little too old for pretending to be doctors of any field, much less something as fanciful as urology. Those kids hadn't even bothered dressing up and playing Pin the Scalpel on the Foreskin or other kiddie games--they just grabbed cookies and punch and ran around talking, or starting fights, or whatever it is kids that gave up on having dreams do. I hated them almost as much as I hated the power couple across the room for getting to fulfill theirs. 

I felt Jessica's hand on my elbow. Surprised that she broke character--Ryan would certainly make her wash her hands again, as seriously as he took the concept of participating in a urethral reconstruction surgery--I turned to face her. ""I know,"" she whispered, not unkindly. ""You're jealous too."" 

So, so jealous. I was mostly surrounded by kids who were young enough to imagine big things for themselves, not to wind up a stupid Power Ranger like their fathers, their fathers before them; by kids who'd just recently realized how fragile their dreams of suburban success really were; and by couples who'd somehow made it to adulthood with everything they ever wanted. The adults in the room that, like me, had to scrape by with whatever crap jobs they could get in this economy, didn't make it any better. 

But Jessica understood. Some days, her love for me is all that got me through my shitty workdays, hours of piloting Zords and stopping intergalactic witches from destroying Earth (in the greater Los Angeles area, at least). 

And as for Ryan...well, hell, he was just a little boy. Let him dream for now. 

I smiled at Jessica through the mask, and dove back into the party. ",AdamRJudge

"[WP] A world where kids dream of being accountants, cashiers, bank managers etc. In the adulthood their dreams are crushed when they have to become astronauts, cowboys, ninjas etc.",SirFluffyTheTerrible,"The first argument I can ever remember was with my older sister Hannah – Grandmother left her beautiful pearl necklace to Hannah and not me. Hannah argued, in her infinite wisdom as a sixteen-year-old, that a little baby six year old like me wasn’t mature enough to wear the necklace. I told her I hoped I would never see her again, and she left for her mission without even saying goodbye to me.

I was the one to come across Hannah in the alleyway behind our home, the jagged edges of a rival ninja’s throwing knife buried deep into her throat, the once white necklace bathed red, the panicked expression of her last moments alive still frozen on her face.

After that, I didn’t want the necklace anymore.

I didn’t want this life either. Danger, uncertainty, loss. I wanted one of those safe jobs where you’re practically guaranteed a long life and a steady income. But I was born into the wrong family. We didn’t have nearly enough money to ship me off to some fancy school where I could study to become an accountant and enter the world of business.

The neighborhood kids were the same way. We all dreamed of becoming something bigger than our parents – accountants, cashiers, bank managers. It must have hurt our parents to see us play those silly games, knowing all along that the world needed more astronauts to map out an escape from our dying earth, cowboys to manage the little natural resources we had left, and ninjas to defend them. Short, unglamorous lives.

A few weeks after my sixteenth birthday, I began my training as a cowgirl, condemning myself to an uncertain, demanding life. Mother dropped me off at the train station alone because my father couldn’t bear to watch another child walk away. Before I left, Mother reached into her pocket and slyly pulled out a strand of pearls.

“I know how much you wanted one, so your father and I saved up,” she whispered. The image of Hannah’s pearls covered in blood flashed before my eyes. My mother gently put the necklace on me, a soft smile on her face as her hands stroked the pearls. 

I imagined an executioner fiddling with the noose on a hanged man and shivered.

Not snapped it. Crushed it. Into dust.

The second sign was immediately after. While he stared at the pencil dust in disbelief. It caught on fire, as a result of what would later be called his voluntary optical infrared emissions.

The third sign was being able to hold a small fire in his hand with no pain, and no burning. At one point later in his career he would withstand molten steel as if it were nothing. But on this day the shock of discovery was too much, and he passed out.

When he woke up he saw a ring of concerned faces. Concerned, but pitying. They knew. Knew what he was. Knew he would never again feel the joy of tabulation. The hot sweats that come from a balanced ledger. The enduring joy of an audit. He'd be fitted for a cape, cast away to the skies. His days would be the endless tedium of stopping the mad alien races, escorting mole men to the depths, and caretaking those who really mattered.

When, much later, he was crushed under the boot of Sarnac, the world destroyer, he had saved 1,245,574 people directly. He'd counted. The earth had been rescued from certain annihilation 4 times. An easy sum. He had carefully taken 423 cats from trees and returned them to their owner, every one a mark in the ledger in his head. But his last thoughts were of none of this.

"[WP] Thousands of years into the future ecological catastrophes have turned Earth into a harsh desert planet, making oceans and lakes the stuff of myths. One day you and your tribe discover an ancient ship, buried in the sands...",SirFluffyTheTerrible,"The sands are full of bones. Bleached white bones from creatures long-gone litter the dunes, empty rib cages pointing to the sky. The shifting winds cover some and reveal others as they scour across the barren landscape; no valley is ever the same twice. The lightest bones stay on the surface, pulled about by the harsh wind - a never-ending dance of the dead. These bones flock together on ridges and then disperse down the sides of dunes, forming temporary reefs and shoals in the sea of sand. 

On higher ground, there are other bones. The bones of buildings that once, the stories say, reached up to the sky. Now they are rubble, jumbled shapes of steel and stone that no longer show their original purpose. No wall stands higher than twice a man's height, no roof stretches over more than a few spans. 

We shelter in the wreckage of the past, using what little shade the tumbled walls still provide. We cannot build as the ancients did, but simply scavenge. Their fallen structures are our protection from the sun's glare, the scraps of metal that survive them are our tools, our weapons.

Our world is small. No man can carry enough water to travel far from the settlement, and no man who tries returns. The sands shift constantly, and it is easy, even close to the settlement, to become disoriented. We make our home in the only visible building as far as the eye can see - the tallest, most noticeable part of this wasteland - and yet every year, we lose people. Children, wandering from the safety of the broken walls, are lost to the endless sands. Men and women, out scavenging or hunting in the wastes, never return. Sometimes, borne by the winds across the dunes, their bones do. 

There are stories of other settlements. Stories of strangers met in the wastes, stories of seeing smoke on the far horizon. Stories that, beyond the endless sands, there is something else. A place where more than sparse moss grows in the shadow of walls, a place where other animals than dust-grey lizards can be found. But these are stories, and nothing more. 

Wilder stories, too, are told around our little flames. Stories of a world that was once fresh and green. Stories of the tall cities of ancient men, the glowing lights and machines that could carry more than any man. Stories of science and magics and wonders that are long since gone. And there are stories, little more than myth or fantasy, of water. 

There was once, it is said, more water. Water everywhere. Water that fell from the sky, and ran in channels, and filled valleys. There was a time, the children recite, when ""sea"" meant endless water, teeming with life, and not bare and empty sands. A time when we drank, and washed, and even played, with water, never thinking of the waste. There was a time when you could drink as much as you wanted, could travel for days in any direction and be sure of finding water there. Even travel across water, swept across the not-dry sea by the winds. So much water you could never count it, never use it, never run out.

But these are all just stories. Half-remembered truth from bygone times mixed with lies to comfort children and amaze the foolish. There never was such water, there never were such seas. Since the time of my father, and his father, and their fathers before them, there have been the sands. Since the dawn of this settlement, there have been the sands.  

We have water. We have water because we have dug for it, sending wells far, far down into the earth. We have water because we set traps for it, guiding the few scarce drops that form in the shade down into carved bone bowls. We have water, but never enough.

We husband it carefully. Each man, woman, and child receives the same allotment. Every day, we fill our bottles from the store and drink from it sparingly, only drinking when we must. There is no water-sea, no sky-fall of precious liquid. There is only the bottle, and the hollow sound of emptiness it makes at the end of each day.

They are cruel stories, I think. Cruel stories that make us long for a world that can never be, perhaps never was. Stories that make the harsh ache in our throats smart the worse, stories that make our pitiful wells seem a mockery of water. If we had no such stories, we would know no other way. We would not long for cool seas and falling rain. We would be content with this dry world and our jealously-hoarded shade. 

But I am not content. Every night, I close my eyes and dream of a soft breeze across blue water. I dream of a sun that warms, not one that glares and threatens angrily, a red ball of rage in a shimmering sky. I dream of exploration, of finding some way to leave our little settlement and travel out, carried by winds across shifting sands to a new, wetter world. 

At noon, when no one scavenges or walks in the waste, I watch. I sit in the shade of a stone block, and watch the sands. I see the bones drift past, the creatures with no names that still swim in a dry sea. I see the dunes rise and fall in front of me, and wish for something new. I wish for a dark shape on the horizon, a traveller from distant lands or a relic of the past world. I wish for a cloud to float across the sun, for cool drops of water to fall from the sky. They are cruel stories, but I cannot get them out of my mind.

I watch the sands, and I dream of a better world. ",Peritract

---
The glass from the broken window doesn't cut you as you slice into your hand over and over and over again. Lightning jolts across the sky, and a crashing rumble rocks the building. You ignore them both and lower your eyes. Months have passed since the realization first hit you. Months of staring bleakly at the sullen, brick walls of the abandoned complex you've always called home. Months of traversing the same steps you've always taken, watching them out of the corner of your eye grimace or look away. Months of asking for charity to the same people, always to be met by snarls or cold shoulders. You've always heard the whispers: hopes, joys, reverence, dispair. All of it not from Him, as you once believed, but from Them. They who called you crazy, who gave you Clozapine and recommended a special ward just for your type.

You sigh. Behind you comes a peculiar sound, much like that of a flag whipping in the wind mixed with that of a jacket being zipped up. You tilt your head towards the noise but do not look directly at the humanoid behind you. You know it is him and wait for the transformation. He is ugly otherwise. You regret this.

The angel steps towards you, bows, and then pulls a cigarette from behind his newly-formed ear. 

""So?"" he asks, placing the cigarette between his lips.

""Isn't that a sin?"" you croak. 

The angel shrugs and drops down beside you, a smirk about his lips in a way that you utterly despise. ""What do you think?""

You frown. ""I don't know.""

""Then how am I supposed to?"" He chuckles and lights the cigarette. 

You glance at him. He's chosen the face of Brad Pitt this time.

""Anyway,"" he continues, ""have you made a decision?""

The storm grows louder outside. Sirens shriek across the city, warning the citizens of the impending danger. You can hear them wailing in the distance as news angencies spout the latest findings from scientists, environmentalists, pretty much any and all with an opinion. All agree that a global storm has settled over the lands of earth and are destined to flood everything and drown everyone. Many are calling it an act of God. You disagree.

""I don't like this.""

""You never do.""

""Why does it have to be this way?""

""Free-will or something.""

""Why me?""

The angel flicks the cigarette away and looks toward the window. After a moment he says, ""You ask this every time, and every time I tell you the same thing. I don't know. I did not create the world or the universe. I did not bring light out of darkness. I did not pull something out of nothing. I'm not the magician with the hat; I'm but one of the many rabbits stuck inside."" He stands up and walks to the window. He enhales deeply. ""You deemed me the caretaker, the one to ask the questions whenever the time for earth's end comes around, to pull you out of the reverie and into the truth. I hate it. I always have, but it is my job, just as yours is to decide what happens next."" He turns back towards you. ""You're the only one with the answers in this world.""

You stare at him and then at your own hands.

""So?"" You hear him say, but your mind is turning and you don't respond.

----

The angel follows behind you as you walk, his face quiet as stone. People are weeping all around you, and you can hear them pleading in their whispers. You ignore them. Your mind is made up. As you walk, people dash quickly by you. Some apologize, but most don't. You pay them no mind and head towards the storm.

At the beach you find a swarm of people praying, their hands joined and their heads bowed as their bodies shiver against the cold rain. The police officers who hadn't abandoned their duties are scattered about close by, most sitting in their cars waiting for the inevitable. One of them gets out and walks toward you.

""Hey! You don't want to be here! Flood's coming, so if you value your life, go back now.""

You nod and continue onto the beach.

He puts his hands up and encircles them around his mouth. ""I said the flood's coming, ya hear?""

The angel gives a salute, and the officer tosses his hands in the air and walks away.

On the beach you push past the crowd. They move around you as you do, allowing you past until you get to the water's edge. A hand grasps your arm, and you look at the person sharply.

""What are you doing?"" the woman asks. You had seen her before at the shelter, a volunteer who always wore a furrowed brow but was never unkind. ""That's not a good idea, sir.""

You blink and shake her hand away.

She looks from one eye to the other and shakes her head. She places her arm on your shoulder. ""Look, I've seen you at the shelter before. I know this is bleak and things haven't gone well for you, but suicide isn't the answer. Please, step back, okay? Not all hope is lost yet.""

You smile and place a hand over hers. ""Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.""

""But, sir, this isn't the right thing to do! I promise things will get better. Please!""

You begin stepping back into the water, but you do not sink into it. It is solid beneath your bare feet but squishy, reminding you of jello. You sigh. You're going to miss jello. 

""Sir! What are you....What are you doing?"" She steps away from you. A crowd had gathered to watch the exchange, murmuring back and forth amongst each other, but now all are silent. A few faint. Some start to cry. Most simply stand with their mouths slightly ajar.

The angel follows you onto the ocean, his feet never once touching the water. You question him on this, and he remarks how he hates messing up his shoes. You laugh, your heart lighter than it's been in years. The walk takes hours, but you finally find the center of the storm. It twirls above you grimly, and you fall back onto your back. The angel looks down at you.

""Your decision is made?""

""Yes,"" you reply, your eyes closed.

""Before we begin, then, may I ask why?""

You open your eyes. ""I think I'm a cynic...""

The angel swallows.

""But a hopeful one,"" you finish.

The angel nods. ""Per usual, then. I must warn you, this is going to hurt.""

""Doesn't it always?""

The angel shrugs and pulls a cigarette out of his pocket. He puts it behind his ear.

""Til next time, then?""

""Of course.""

The angel walks away as the water encompasses you.

"[WP] Humans are not the most war-like species in the galaxy. Not the most inventive, most belligerent or most advanced. Humans are, however, the best at one thing: we make love like wildebeests. We are the most gifted lovers in the known galaxy which is why so many of us have been abducted.",dukeofearlsweatshirt,"The Translator was built by the Standard People.  Unlike Terrans, Ba'artig, Xorfloo, and Snee, the native linguistic rendering of ""Standard People"" was unknown. The machine was cleverly set up to render the meaning of the chauvinistic term ""Standard People"" in the listener's primary language.

Internally, an abstract metasemantic engine ensured that no trace of the Standard language was used even ""under the hood"", as it were.  These days, nobody even knew who the Standard People *were*.  Perhaps they were a known species trying to create plausible deniability for their invention, or an older species who left, went extinct, or into hiding for some reason.

In any event, the Translator came with no warranty, and nobody to sue in case things went wrong.  And, given the delicate nature of interspecies diplomacy, the fates of entire civilizations continually depended on the predictable function of this unique device.

And predictable it was, until the day I showed up at Central Hub, a vast, brilliant city built on the Translator's outer surface, orbiting a lonely star.

I was sent as a Special Envoy for the Terran Government in Exile (a euphemism for ""we trashed our solar system and are now homeless in space"").  My mission was to secure any viable resource rights, allies, funds, or territory I possibly could, through any legal means.

First, I went to the Xorfloo embassy. The 'floo were the closest things we had to friends out here, though perhaps the archaic term ""frenemies"" might be more apt.

My AR Helmet was connected directly to my brainjack, wirelessly to the Translator's network, through which I was able to initiate communication with any nearby being.

The Xorfloo receptionist barely waved its pseudopod in acknowledgement.  A wave of bored condescension, desaturated grey colors, and the taste of cardboard mildly assaulted my senses.  ""What is it, Terran?  Come to beg for scraps?""

*Fuck you*, I thought reflexively.  Uh-oh.  Was my helmet's sensitivity recalibrated with the last upgrade?  Shitshitshitshitshit.  The Translator had picked up the phrase.

""Beg pardon, Terran?  You wish to copulate?  You probably don't even know where to stick it!""

*I'll show you where to stick it, you pulsating sac of protoplasm!*  Aww, crap.  Did I think that out loud?

Waves of colors never seen by human eyes danced in my mind, a spark of shock, a tingle of excitement, and a rush of eroticism.  Every Xorfloo in the room was rubbing its pseudopod against the sensitive membrane at the opening of its cloaca.

And the damn Translator was ensuring that *I* felt the arousal as well, including the anatomical analogue of the touching sensation.  My phenotype this week was mostly male, and I had the weirdest boner of all time and space.

""Oh, my.  The Terran has Talent!"" said the receptionist.

""It's like a feedback loop of pleasure,"" cooed another.

And a feedback loop it was, rapidly culminating in wave after wave of pure mental orgasm sensation.  All the Xorfloo tensed up, becoming surprisingly rigid for beings with no solid structure, then relaxed all at once.

All my senses were glitching out with fractal waves of pleasure, to the point where pleasure and pain were indistinguishable.  I was suddenly aware of direct mental contact with every Xorfloo in the entire Hub.

""Stop, Terran! We yield!"" cried every Xorfloo in one voice.  ""You have conquered us with your ferocious libido!  Our species submits to your mighty sexual prowess!""

I swam back to awareness.  My shorts were ruined, I had caused an interspecies diplomatic incident, and telepathically fucked a roomful of intelligent space amoebas until their entire species surrendered.

*I wonder how I did it?*  The thought echoed once in my skull, then bold red letters swarmed in my mind:

First their homeworld is an abhorrent patchwork of climates and biomes, resulting in a crazy quilt of a planet with many small, narrow ecological niches allowing for an incredible diversity in physiologies and traits.

Unlike the forest worlds, ocean worlds, mountain worlds, and desert worlds most of us are so familiar with, humans must suffer through extreme environmental changes within a comparatively small area.

Second, their world is completely and utterly lacking in Element X, which is not only easily utilized for anti-gravity purposes, granting psychic powers, and when heated provided a very tasty sauce, but also provides a stabilizing effect on plate tectonics, magnetic fields, and the weather.

Due to these two factors human beings come in a massive variety of forms and colorations, requiring them to have exceedingly broad specifications for attractiveness in a mate.

Contrast this with your typical L'tharsa, who will projectile vomit upon witnessing a member of the opposite sex whose mandibles vary in shape or size to their own by three percent.

And third, due to some sort of species-wide mental defect they are prone to over-empathizing to the point where they are capable of experiencing emotions based on the anthropomorphication of common household objects.

For example in one series of experiments a pair of novelty plastic googly eyes were glue to a rock upon which a line was drawn resembling the human's common facial expression for displaying happiness.

Lab personnel referred to the rock as ""Steve,"" stated that Steve had a family, and elaborated on an obviously fictional background for the inanimate rock. The rock was then disposed of in various ways, including being pulverized, dissolved in acid, and being placed in front of a video display projecting a human documentary program on a disguised Lardaghast and her larvae living amongst humans, referred to as ""Here Comes Honey Boo Boo.""

Most subjects displayed measurable emotional effects at the mistreatment of the non-sentient, inanimate object.

It is my theory that as a result of this over-active capacity for empathy human beings are thus capable of effectively and easily bonding to virtually any race and tending to their carnal and emotional needs.

This position is backed by data from the human race's own records, where not only does it appear most humans more frequently copulate with inanimate objects (frequently tissues, though inflatable facsimiles of other humans and rubber emulations of male and female genitals are also common), but they will also declare various inanimate objects as their lifemate.

My cursory evaluation has found humans wedded in this fashion to structures, landmasses, human facsimiles that they treat as they would another human, and fictional characters.

As a result it is no surprise that a species who can fall in love with an animated, brightly colored fictional quadrupedal ungulate can maintain that capacity for anything from the Snotfolk of Regulon 14, to the stony She-Titans of Granitrax IV.",VonKrieger

I would laugh, but my mouth was already full of ropy tendrils.

My customer, 'Hank', whose language I will never understand because I don't have the sensory organs to accept the chemicals his species uses to communicate, currently has me hanging in midair, his tactile sensors playing around my insides while his pollen sack swells. I am thoroughly inured to hentai jokes at this point.

I close my eyes, shuddering just a little, wishing I had goggles as his squirmy bits suddenly stiffen and I am coated in a burst of pollen that makes me look, for all the universe, like I had the most absurd spay tan in history. A moment later I am on the floor, his tentacles very slowly retracting. I pat one of the ones as it passes by my hand and it takes on a pink hue before contracting into a little ball and gingerly rolling away. 'Hank' is a repeat customer.

I get up, heading for the shower before it's time to go back on shift at the Human Benevolence Society. Don't take that the wrong way. It really is a benevolent organization. The only human organization in space. 

It started in the forties or so. Abductions had always happened, but until then, those who were free were just... adrift. It's illegal to interact with pre-Warp civilizations. As a Star Trek fan I rue the irony. Anyway a car full of Elks members were picked up, illegally enslaved, and subsequently freed before they could be disbursed. Left to their own devices they did the only job they could find to earn money for food and clothing: have sex. 

I don't know what they felt about it, but the draw of multiple human males was quite a draw, and they saved up to rent a place that humans could congregate, find food, a place to stay and... work. By the time I got dumped on them (the police now actively take human abductees here) it was the largest human settlement/charity/brothel in space. I have a room, enough food, and clothing on my off hours.

I finish toweling myself off and head back to the front desk. A few others are lounging around waiting for another customer, or a new human to arrive. I sit down, tenderly, and silently thank anyone who is listening glad that the cleaning stations are as thorough as they are.

A few minutes later the next customer arrives. I silently groan. A Threndaci. They're not bad, they're just... well... the thing about Threndaci is that we can't have conventional sex with them. It'd be like sleeping with a blue whale. That means whoever it picks is going to have a few good minutes INSIDE writhing to get out.

Of course when it sees me it makes a beeline for me, much to the relief of my coworkers. I sigh, getting up. My reputation as the human who fucked that Karthesy general into a three month coma had apparently spread...",Jurodan

"[WP] The constant one liners and dramatic situations made you suspicious. But now that you can hear a laugh track, you're fairly certain you live in a TV sitcom.",onedoesnotsimplyfini,"I first noticed something may have been odd surrounding my life when I was seven years old.
My family has always been a bit ... *interesting*. Both my mom and dad work full time jobs, yet they almost always have time for us. There are never any complaints regarding money, or stress. They always seemed to have everything under control. Except fir us kids. My older brother, James, is a big sports fanatic. He's not particularly coordinated, or very smart, but he constantly seems to be getting extremely lucky. That is, when he isn't getting into major trouble. My older sister, Abby, has always been extremely stereotypical. Always obsessed with fashion, or popularity, or boys. She tended to be much smarter than James, but somehow got into even more trouble.  
I've always been the odd one out within my family. Or at least, I have been from their perspective. On the first day I noticed anything weird, we had gone to the zoo. By some strange stroke of fate, if it can be called that, I was seperated from my family. I had attempted to set up a meeting spot if we did get seperated, but no one listened. Yes, even at seven years old, I was more responsible than my parents. While attempting to find the main office so that I could contact them over the intercom, I ran into one of my friends from school, Tommy McPherson. In all honesty, he was the only kid in school who I knew the nane of. That should have set me off, but I was more ignorant in my youth.  
Tommy had been standing with his family in front of the lions pit. His parents weren't paying much attention to him at all. He decided to try getting their attention by jumping into the lions pit.  
As he jumped, I felt torn. On the one hand, I knew jumping into the lions pit was a stupid, idiotic, certifiably-insane idea. Yet, at the same time, I felt drawn in to attempt to save him. I ignored my instincts, but that overpowering feeling... I knew I had to do something, so I pulled on Mrs. McPherson's dress. Grabbing her attention, I directed her gaze towards her son. I felt the urge die within me, but it was more of a death of inapropriate timing than one of vanquishment. I knew it would be coming back.  
I left Tommy and his family, deciding that the fewer people there, the easier it would be for the zookeepers to rescue him. I found the office, but of course there was no one there. I decided to wait. A few hours later, my family arrived at the park door. Mom's hair was extremely disheveled, and Dad appeared to have a swollen eye. My brother seemed to be covered in scratches, while my sister had a deep red goop flowing all down her body. I later learned this was ketchup. The next day, it was as if we had never gone to the zoo.  
I learned to mistrust the mysterious voice. I suspect everyone in my family has one. I'm simply the only one able to ignore it. It's the only explanation I can fathom for their behaviour.  
As time proceeded, the situations my family and I got into became more and more extravegant. Once, Abby had decided to have a slumber party, and bought a Ouija board for it. She and her friends had just started to use it when there was an earthquake. The house shook, the lights went out, and they were terrified. They locked the door to her room, and began acting extremely paranoid. Unfortunately, the earthquake had caused my mom to drop the three bags of flour she was carrying. I still don't remember why she had them. They spilled all over us, coating us in a fine white dust.  
The voice told me to try checking that my sister was okay. At that point, I knew not to do anything it said. Instead, I went to the bathroom, had a quick cold shower, then changed into a new set of non-floured clotheswhen I got to my sisters room, she and her friends were adamantly denying any and all evidence that Mom, Dad and James weren't ghosts. I was going to try straightening things out when I felt a searing pain through my forehead. It seemed similar in nature to the voice, but much more powerful. It subsided when I decided not to interfere in the ghost buisness.  
Everything was eventually cleared up. I knew that I could ignore the voice, but not the screech. My sister threw out the Ouija board. I stole it from the trash can. At that point, everything was completely insane, and I felt that it may be my best chance at understanding the world.  
That night, the voice spoke to me. It did so in a way that it never had. Instead of telling me to do something, it seemed to be asking me. Talking to me as if I were an equal, or even a superior. *Look, Sam, I know we didn't get off on the right foot. However, I'm here to help you. I can't tell you much, not directly, but I do hold some sway over your actions, and over the world around you. I can't reveal much like this, but I do know a way that I can. I just need you to trust me.*  
The voice and I began taking on a very different relationship. It didn't tell me to do anything to extreme, but it did help me avoid getting in the way of my family's schemes. We both wanted to avoid the screech. As well, it began to clue me in to more of the going's on around my household. This lead to me learning that we were being watched.  
It wasn't an easy realization to come to. However, as I became more in tune with the voice, I began hearing murmers, gasps, and laughs. They seemed to coincide with my family's events, even when I had no way of knowing what was going on with them. It had been four years since the day at the zoo, and things were finally coming together.  
The voice and I did find a use for the Ouija board. As it said, it couldn't reveal much to me through my thoughts. However, it could control my actions, especially my more discrete ones. We began working together. After I realized we were being watched, the voice could finally explain how it worked in general. The watchers could only see so much in a given week. This was the limiting reagent on my family's schemes: they had to have everything relevent within a half hour. This lead to me making a few bad decisions of my own. I kept them small, and made sure that they were my choices and not the voices. I still didn't trust him completely. However, my little stunts did push the envelope. No real time left to watch us outside of the schemes. No time to watch us at night, when we should all be asleep. No time to watch me use the Ouija board.  
As I put the circle on the board for the first time, I felt the voice coursing through my arm, moving them at it's will. I saw the message it wrote. I still remember it to this day.  
*You exist entirely within a sitcom. I am one of the writers, and do not wish you any harm. I joined the team later than the others. You were the only character I had a hand in making. I tried to make you fit into the show, but you put up such resistance. I knew that your character wouldn't do that sort of thing. The other writers disagreed. They tried to get me to change you, but I knew that wouldn't be right. I created you a specific way; I'm not going to change you. When you started getting in the way of the others, they started to get really angry. They threatened to fire me, and to have someone else write you. That night, I found a way to make contact with you. I've been defending you ever since, keeping you out of trouble and out of the way. I knew you deserved answers, which is why I'm telling you this. The show can't go on forever. When it ends, I'll do my best to keep you alive.*  
That was twelve years ago. I'm twenty three now, and have my own kids and a husband. Somehow, I managed all that while still graduating from university. The voice hasn't talked to me in years, but I know he's still there. I still hear the murmering and the laughter. I still see my family do irrational, insane things. I still exist solely with a sitcom. ",gemohandy
[WP] In your lifetime you have attained near infinite cosmic power. You have however failed to fulfill the first dream you ever had: To bake a decent cake.,cerapa,"God hummed to himself and activated his CreationForge® again.  It had been a long time, an eternity some might say, but he was finally ready to move on to the ultimate act of cosmic creation, the baking of a perfect cake.  But first he was going to practice with some people.

So he programmed the parameters, made a quick world, and let the program run.  *Ding.*

He rushed over just as the machine spit the resulting people out onto the planet and grimaced.  They just weren't perfect.  They had pasty white undone skin -- anyone could tell that they hadn't been cooked nearly long enough.  He sighed and his sigh rippled through his world as a massive peal of thunder.

Rechecking the manual, he adjusted a few parameters and set the machine to try baking one more time.  He'd just gotten into a new book, ""Harry Potter and the Creation Stone"" when the timer went off again.  *Ding.*

As he rushed over, he reflected that he should really prompt someone to write a set of stories like this, someday. He'd put it on his to-do list sometime.  He eagerly looked down at where the machine had put people down on the world and grimaced again.  These just weren't perfect either.  They had been cooked a little too long.  He sighed and once again his sigh rippled through his world as a massive peal of thunder.

""One more try,"" he thought, ""One more try then I'm taking this machine back to the store.""  He'd mastered nearly every cosmically possible skill but this cooking thing was still proving a little tricky.  He adjusted a few more parameters and went back to his book, impatiently standing right by the machine while he read.  Just as he was getting into the book again, the machine dinged and he leaned over to watch the resulting people being transferred into the hopper and deposited on his world.

These were perfect, a lovely golden brown, just the right shade.  Finally, at long last, he was probably ready to try baking the perfect cake.

"[WP] You live in a world where every year on your birthday, you are given the option of advancing to the next age or staying the same age for another year.",Kcb1986,"Of course, when his yearly chance to choose came up, when he was presented with the opportunity to choose to grow one year older or to stay at the same age, of course he'd choose to stay at the same age.

[IP] Teddy Bear Guardian,Alekosen,"((This story is based on [this image](http://s3.amazonaws.com/wootsaleimages/The_Guardian7hnDetail.png))):

Monstrosaur was, by trade, an accountant.  He'd gone out with a few monster friends and they'd had fun, but they were a little low on fear juice and truth be told an evening just wasn't as fun without it.  On the way back home they'd passed the Scaritorium and his friends had egged him on, to go get a little extracurricular action.  ""Go ahead,"" they'd said.  ""It'll be fun,"" they'd said.  ""Go scare some kid.""

Monstrosaur had been feeling a little down and he a little scare ought to pep him right up.  ""A little bit of the ol' fear juice flowing in my veins?  Nothing better to cap an evening with, right boys?""  So he'd stumbled in, signed his name, gotten his ticket and managed to get into the portal room.

He'd just manifested up through the floor and was about to make his scariest faces when he noticed something coming out from the teddy bear on the child's bed.  Really?  A bear guardian totem?  People still used those in this day and age?  People still knew how to make them?  He just wanted a little scare, a little fear, he was just a bookkeeper really, he didn't know the first thing about fighting.

Great, just great.  He could tell, this was going to be a fantastic fabulous evening, one for the record books.  He sighed heavily.  Maybe he could reverse portal back out before the bear finished manifesting?

Suddenly the bear spirit spoke up.  ""Want to go halvsies on a little fear juice?""

""You're pulling my leg.""

""You don't have legs yet and no, I'm not.  Look, you scare her, I'll hang back, then I'll jump in, scare you off.  We can keep doing it for a couple nights, you bring back half of what you got the night before each time.  I'll look like a hero for getting rid of you.  You'll look like a hero for getting away.  We both get an easy score.""

Monstrosaur considered it.  That sounded doable.  Records didn't record sound or visuals, just the metaphysical aftermath.  He'd be able to tell everyone that he'd taken out a bear totem and gotten away unharmed, which would give him some serious rep.  He shrugged his shoulders, ""Ok, sounds like a plan.""

He finally finished portalling in and got ready to scare the little girl when the bear finished manifesting.  The bear shook himself, reached out with a massive paw, and slammed Monstrosaur's head down on the floor.  ""I lied.  Nobody messes with my little girl.""

The A-Team become Uber employees and your character gets taken for a wild ride. [WP],IamGront,"""Hi,"" I said, as I slide the van door open.  I'd called for Uber Black, but I'd left the option open for Uber Pool to split the fare and it looked like I was going to get a cheaper ride.  There was a nice-looking chap driving the van -- the app said his name was Templeton, which I found hilarious.  I mean, Charlotte's Web came out before my parents were born -- I remember when I was a kid I'd hear about how they used to read it and now I would get to read it too, and it had been a big success so his parents must have been aware of the rat by the time he was born, right?  But I didn't comment on that -- no point in getting the guy upset who was was going to be driving after all.

There was an older white-haired gentleman sitting in the front passenger seat, one of the fun differences between West Coast and East Coast Uber, so I'd found.  In the West, an Uber passenger was likely to just jump into the front seat and chat away.  In the East, people never got into the front seat and they rarely ever said anything.  A really happy-looking guy was in the far back, furiously air drumming, a big black guy with a mohawk and lots of gold chains frowned at me from the middle bench, and a smoking hot woman sat on the front bench.  Naturally I choose to sit next to her.

""It says here that you'd like to go to the airport,"" Templeton said.

""Yeah, I'm flying out LAX to Boston for a convention,"" I said.

""Well, soon as you buckle your seatbelt, we'll get started,"" Templeton said.

""Thanks,"" I replied, ""A lot of Uber drivers don't even care about that and just start driving before I can even pull the belt, let alone buckle anything.

""Fascinating,"" the old guy said, turning around to look at me as the black guy piped up, ""Only a fool would fly when he could drive!""

""Excuse him,"" the old guy said, ""My name's Hannibal, that's B. A. behind you, in the back is Murdoch, and next to you is Jill.""

""It's uh great to meet you all,"" I said.  I hadn't known that I'd have to be sociable this trip -- maybe I should have shaved.  ""My name is Matt and I'm not a big fan of flying either,"" I said, turning around, ""But taking an Uber from California to Massachussets?  That'd be a few thousand dollars even if there wasn't a surge on.  Alaska Air lets me fly round trip for like $300, as long as I sign up a few months in advance.""

""Star power,"" Murdoch yelled, bring both hands down on B. A.'s shoulders before returning to furiously air drumming.

""Hey man,"" B. A. said, twisting in his seatbelt, ""How many times have I got to tell you, this is real life, not Guitar Hero!""

He started smacking Murdoch's hands until Templeton yelled, ""Hey, cut it out back there or so help me, I'm going to pull this van over!""

B. A. twisted back in his seat, muttering, as Murdoch continued air drumming.  ""I'm sorry,"" Hannibal said, ""Murdoch just gets a little excited.""

Suddenly I felt the van jolt as another car clipped the back corner and sped past.

""Oh no,"" Templeton said, ""And I just got this van back from being repaired.""

""Oh no,"" Jill said, ""It's my husband!""

""Oh no,"" B. A. said, ""I pity the fool who'd try that!""

""Oh no,"" Murdoch said, ""I just lost my streak!  Better restart the song.""

The other crew must have tapped its parking brake as it spun around, rocketed past us, spun again, then started chasing us.

""No problem,"" Hannibal said, reaching over and pulling a lever on the dash as Templeton slammed his food down on the accelerator.

The seat pressed tightly into my back as the van's speed sharply increased.  A grinding noise from behind me was my only warning as the back doors swing open and Murdoch's seat swung around, half hanging out the door as a machine gun dropped down from the roof in front of him.

Murdoch threw imaginary drumsticks at the car behind then grabbed the gun and started shooting as Templeton changed 3 lanes at once and shot off the offramp, careening around the corner and onto one of the steep LA side streets.  We thumped bumped down the road, bouncing off potholes and I thanked my lucky stars that I'd buckled my seatbelt on.

Murdoch started whooping like he was riding a bull in the rodeo and B. A. buried his face in his hands.  ""Not again,"" he moaned.

""Again,"" I cried, ""This has happened to you before?""

""Well,"" Hannibal said, ""Into every man's life a little rain must fall.  I'm sure this will all be over very shortly.""

We must have lost the car behind us as I couldn't see it anymore.  Hannibal pulled the lever again and the gun retracted into the roof and Murdoch's seat swung back inside.  Templeton screeched around a few more corners, ran a couple red lights, shot down the straight away and pulled into some airline parking.  We all jumped out of the car and B. A. started yelling, ""I told you, fools, I'm not going to get in another plane!""

""Don't worry,"" Hannibal said soothingly, ""You won't have to,"" just as Templeton pulled out a taser and jabbed it into B. A's back.  B. A. went down swinging and Hannibal calmly pulled a syringe out of his breast pocket and jabbed it into B. A.'s neck.  Templeton grabbed B. A. under the shoulders and Murdoch grabbed the legs and they took off with Jill running interference for them.

""I'm not worried about airport security,"" Hannibal said, ""We'll be taking a private plane.""

I nodded dumbly, clutching my two overnight bags which Alaska Airlines would let me check into the carryout section, where I'd get them back on the tarmac immediately after landing instead of having to go wait in some baggage section of the Boston airport and this is not an ad for Alaska Airlines.*

""And when Uber insurance calls,"" Hannibal said, ""Make sure you tell them exactly what happened and how someone else ran into us.  I can't afford to keep repairing the van every time on my own dime.""

As he walked away, I pulled out my cellphone and tapped the Uber app icon.  5/5 stars.  I didn't want Templeton to lose his job by getting a low rating.

I bust my ass for this company for 25 years, do overtime, put it before my own personal time, I pass on raises and promotions in hard times - all this and now you shaft me with a transfer to the fucking Moon?!""",Draki1903,"I snapped my helmet down and prepared for the secondary safety inspection.  Nobody could ever sign off on their own suit, as a secondary, only someone else could.  It was an annoying policy, but there was no question that it worked.  Even when people were dead on their feet, just wanted to rush through one last trip, nobody wanted to be held responsible for someone else dying after signing that everything was fine.  It also lowered the suicide rate.  As depressed as some people got, knowing that someone else was going to be held responsible for your death if you cracked a seal open had brought suicides down 80%.

Safety check passed, I cycled through the airlock and jumped into a car.  This was ridiculous.  I couldn't believe that I was sitting on the moon in a car, if it could be called a car -- on Earth we would have had a hard time justifying it as even a go-cart and here these pieces of junk were de rigueur.  I'd busted myself working for the company for 25 years, 60-80 hours a week, every week.  I'd lost my family, I'd lost everything but did I make partner?  No, I was transferred to the Moon.

I wasn't even transferred to the good side of the moon, the one with the great Earth view, the one with the view that tourists were willing to pay a million dollars for.  I was stuck on the far side of the moon, with just the stars, just the ordinary stars that were nothing different than what I could see on the earth.  Sure, I could see a few more up here, but they were still just stars.  Honestly, not even the tourists were willing to come out this way.  People always oohed and awed over the stars and how clear the night sky was, but it was a 2-3 day trip to the moon.

After a few days in close confinement with the other rich obnoxious snobs on the trip, with nothing much to do other than browse the entire volume of Wikipedia (downloaded to the shuttle computers), talk, read (but each person was only permitted a single book due to weight concerns, which usually just meant a Kindle), sleep, or look at the stars, nobody wanted to spend another day to fly around the moon just to look at the stars again, except lucky ducks like me.

There were only a couple hours of satellite communication available on this side of the moon each day -- everything else was in an L4 orbital position to give geosynchronous coverage to the earth-side of the moon, so only the screwups were sent out here, only people that nobody wanted, or the stray rare astronomer who actually wanted to look at the stars all day and all night.

Maybe I should have taken some of those raises.  Sure, I'd been offered a few raises, but they'd never come with pay increases, just increases in responsibilities.  I'd been told that the company had been going through some hard times and that there just wasn't any money for raises.  Then the bankruptcy settlement and the reorganization -- people with high job titles had been able to walk away with a golden parachute while all the rest of us were just reclassified as something comparable to our previous positions and everything went on as before, only now instead of being someone who'd been there for 25 years, who'd worked his fingers to the bone for the company, I was technically a new hire with decades out of date training and no hope and no chance of ever getting a promotion.

I'd become an embarrassment to the company and so they'd transferred me out here, where nobody could see me.  I sighed and pulled up the map of where I was going to go next.  I was a trained geologist, once one of the best and lunar geology, earth geology, there wasn't any difference to my managers.  There were some gravity anomalies that the satellite had picked up on and that I was assigned to investigate.  Usually it just meant a cluster of heavy metals rare enough to be worth taking a look at but not worth sending a mining crew up here.

Today it was my job to set up some 30-liter seismic sources, analyze the results, then send the results back to headquarters.  I drilled a hole, set one up, then set the charge, making sure I was well out of the possible blast radius.  I clumsily pulled up my computer and took a look at the preliminary results and my heart almost burst out of my chest.  This wasn't possible.  I hurriedly set up a second source, double checking everything of course -- no point in killing myself accidentally -- and wired the charges to blow in tandem, measuring out some extra cord to the farther so that the electrical impulses hit each source as near as simultaneously as possible.

I backed up, hit the green go button, raised the shield and clicked the green detonate switch and waited for the explosion.  As soon as I felt the small blast wave tremble under my feet, I hurried back to the car and pulled up the computer screen.

[WP] He didn't simply want to kill them. He wanted to kill them PERFECTLY.,TheSs7SsN,"She lined up for another shot.  She didn't simply want to kill them, she wanted to kill them *perfectly*.

She grunted as the shot went wide.  Only by a little bit, but just wide enough to miss.  She was nervous and her hands were shaking by just a little bit.  Tonight was it.  Her first step into the pros.

Her dad had made his try for the pros, made it, and what an accomplishment it was to just make it in, to be accounted as one of the big boys, to be recognized as he walked down the street.  When he walked into the barbershop, other men made way for him and let him hop into the chair first.  He'd only stayed in for a few short years until an injury had sidelined him.  Still, the game was in his blood and he couldn't bring himself to leave.  He'd managed to keep a foot in the door, training and beating the snot out of new recruits, carrying equipment, whatever he could to stay close.  He'd loved the business enough that nobody had wanted to put him down.

He'd started training her when she was young.  Practice, practice, practice.  Every night a few shots.  As she got older, as she gained more control, the practices started to get longer.  Running, jumping, duking, diving.  Charging a man, shouldering him, the concealed hits when nobody was looking, everything legal and everything that wasn't, she was trained in all of them.  She was used to taking on people twice her size and twice her weight.  Tonight, when they were all her size, all her weight, she'd have every advantage and nothing could hold her back.

Tonight was her night.  Tonight was her initiation.  And she wasn't simply going to kill them.  It wasn't a matter of want or could or ability or initiative, she was going to kill them and she was going to do it perfectly.  She'd show everyone.  She deserved to be a pro!  Tonight was her night!

She leaned down and picked up the basketball for another shot.

"[WP] A man walks into work everyday, he is immortal and unchanging, how long until people begin to notice he isn't aging.",bacon8743,"""Shh, shh,"" Charlene whispered, ""There he goes.""  We quieted down as Jake walked past us.  We'd heard rumors that one of those freakish Immortalis was working here.  Of course we were all jealous.  Who wouldn't be jealous?  The chance to live forever, to be immortal and unchanging?

The only problem was what you had to do to get it.  It was a blood-borne pathogen, transmitted by coming into contact with someone else's blood, or other bodily fluids.  So you'd think that the Immortalis would be kept chained up somewhere, drained dry, their blood sold on the black market, that they'd never want for a sexual partner, right?  No, the disease had a 99.997% mortality rate.  If you survived the first month, then you were golden, untouchable, but almost nobody survived anywhere near that long.  Virtually everyone who contracted it died.  When the news had first broken, as people started sharing and liking posts about it, the Immortalis had almost all been massacred as fear of their disease started to spike.  A few had been killed, but after they'd reached from beyond the grave and taken down their attackers, things had settled into a sort of détente, a frozen cold war war.  It turns out that beating someone to death and literally getting blood on your hands is a really bad idea when their blood spreads an invariably fatal disease.

Charles was always pointing someone out at work. Every year or two, he'd get it in his head that one of our coworkers was an Immortalis.  ""You see?  He doesn't age,"" he'd hiss.  ""He must be one of them, one of those freaks caught up in their golden years, always in the prime of their life, never aging!""  He and Charlene and I had just been talking about Jake.  Personally, I found it hard to believe.  I'd seen Jake occasionally post pictures that were ostensibly of himself on a Throwback Thursday.  He Facebook profile went back several years and it looked like he'd changed slightly in the past five or six years, but then who changed quickly overnight?  Nobody.  Everyone always looked the same if you only ever looked at their past couple years of photos.

Besides, it was probably just jealousy.  Charles thought that all Immortalis were perfect and whenever he saw someone who looked better than him his first through was always that they must be an Immortalis, that they had won the lottery and been reamade into an Adonis or Aphrodite when that wasn't at all the case.  It's not like all the Immortalis were young, that they were all in the prime of their life, perfectly good looking.  Occasionally, once in a very long time, someone very old or very young would live through the first month and be caught like that for the rest of their very long life.  Giving someone else the disease could of course lead to a murder charge and at the very least usually resulted in a manslaughter charge, so most Immortalis lived rather lonely lives.  I rather pitied them myself.

Life insurance policies hadn't really changed much, even annuities.  Sure, there were a very small number of people who'd live forever, but that was more than offset by the number of people who'd die upon contracting the disease, so mortality rates never really changed.  Ballooning annuities, though, had become a thing of the past.  Inflation would eventually wipe any annuity payment down to ""nothing to worry about"", but if payments kept pace with inflation and payments continued forever, then that would eventually be something to worry about.

Suddenly a hush settled over the office as Old Man Whithers walked by and a thought hit me.  After he passed, I leaned over to Charlene and asked her, ""How long has Old Man Whithers been working here?""

""A few years ago we celebrated his 50th anniversary.  He started in the mailroom then worked his way up, why?""

""He's been CEO for a long time,"" I said.

""You're right,"" Charles said, ""I bet he'd do anything to keep his son from inheriting.""

""I know where you're going with this,"" she said, ""But I hear he still has a couple of mistresses and nobody who was an Immortalis would be dumb enough to keep sleeping around and get a life sentence for murder.""

""Maybe,"" Charles said, ""But he still has 55% ownership.  Even if he went to jail he might think it was worth it.""

""By the way,"" I said, changing the subject, ""How'd you enjoy your vacation in Aruba?""

""Oh it was wonderful,"" she said, moving over to the printer to pick up some reports, ""I'm so glad I had enough vacation to extend it by another week.  Getting to spend a month there was heavenly.""

""Stop,"" Charles said, ""I didn't correctly add it up at first, you just took vacation for a month?""  He gave her a long quizzical look before turning back to his computer.

I knew what he was thinking, but it was a ridiculous thought.  Charlene as a secret Immortalis?  Please, she couldn't keep a secret for longer than a day.  Old Man Whithers?  Possible, but he wasn't.  Jake?  Yeah, he actually was.  I should know, I'd been a member of the Immortalis support network for the past three years.

[IP] Fish,madlabs67,"I loved watching the fish through my window.  They'd swim past so ethereally and I'd stand, stuck on the ground, watching.  Sometimes I'd lay down on my bed and look over at the fish.  I'd spread my arms and legs out and pretend that I was swimming too.  I'd pucker my mouth and make fish noises, the way that they did.  Their cold dark eyes, as big as my head, would stare unblinking at everything around them and sometimes it seemed that they were watching me too.

I'd tried swimming in the bathtub, of course.  When I was young I could fill it up and float, but I hadn't been able to do that for several years now.  Even when I slumped down on my back in the tub, my knees still stuck out of the water no matter how I twisted, and of course there wasn't any room for me to move my arms more than a couple inches.  I could still float a little, but only if I took a deep breath.  Sometimes I'd take a deep breath and see how long I could hold it, see how long I could float in the water until I finally let it all out and fell back onto my back in the bathtub, gasping for air.

I liked to paint the fish too.  Mom and Dad were both artists, which was how we were able to requisition a house here, and although my paintings weren't as good as theirs were, they were starting to climb in value.  Mom said I'd be able to stand on their reputation for a while and that people were investing, hoping that an early work from me would someday be worth more just because I was the one who'd painted it.  Sometimes I'd draw a dry brush slowly across the canvas and imagine that the skritch noise it made was the noise of fish, eating the kelp.

I tucked my teddy bear, Mr. Roosevelt, into my bed and sat down to start a new painting.  My parents had shown me pictures of where we used to live, pictures of me as a baby splashing around in what they called an ocean, but I didn't remember any of that.  I would never be able to swim here, but that didn't mean I couldn't draw myself in the water.  I could be out there, swimming with the fish, even if only in my dreams.

I started humming to myself as I drew when the house alarm went off and I jumped in surprise, dragging the brush down off the painting.  I quickly set my brush down and grabbed Mr. Roosevelt.  When the alarm goes off, you have to go, that's the rule.  See, where there's fish, there are things that eat the fish.  Suddenly a cephalopod acetabulum slammed down on the window.

"[WP] It was love at first sight, but he always had been near-sighted.",thecoverstory,"It had been love at first sight.  Well, perhaps only mutual infatuation, but as they talked together and laughed together and made plans to see each other again another night, little whispers started to creep into their brains.  ""Is this love?  I'm feeling something, I like this person but is this love?  If this isn't love, what is?""

They'd met to go on a date and had a wonderful time, even though they hadn't even left the apartment.  They'd put on a movie that had remained unwatched as they kept talking to each other, although the popcorn was eaten as they reminisced about their lives, reliving old experiences with each other.  He worked drive-thru at a fast food restaurant, she was in the military.  The occupations were so different, but their souls were so similar.  They'd made plans to meet again.

One day he'd been busy at work, working the drive thru and the counter at the same time.  He had a particular set of talents which made this easier for him than for most -- he simply carried on two conversations at once.  With the mute button on his belt-walkie, he'd simply mute what he was saying when he spoke with people at the counter, and turn his head when he spoke to people in the drivethru, working two computers at once as he danced around handing out orders.

One person had been kind of hesitant to talk to him on the intercom that day but he'd let them take their time.  Truth be told, the menu was a little bewildering to people who were looking at it for the first time, so he let the person take their time while he caught up with the person at the counter and on getting the next order out.

Someone had come to the window and as he'd swiftly taken money, counted out change and handed that out along with the order, someone that day had said something about being deployed, about needing to talk and he'd nodded his head as he eyed the drinks that were pouring and told them to have a great day in his ""this has been amazing, but seriously I have a line of five people here"" voice and the person had driven on and he'd gone back to serving.

That weekend, he'd tried to go visit her, had tried to stop by her place, but only her roommate was there and the one he really wanted to see was apparently gone for the next few years.  He thought back, had she stopped by, was she the person who'd been in his drive thru line?  He hadn't really noticed -- his near-sightedness made it rather difficult for him to make out faces even at that distance, they just didn't compute until he got closer.

And he wept.

I sunk down in my seat.  How'd they find out it was me?  I swear it was probably Chi who ratted me out.  I knew I shouldn't have said anything in front of me.

""Azel, the principal's?""

""Fine, fine,"" I groused as I sauntered out of the classroom.  It had just been a few ordinary mushrooms crammed into locker slots because you know, why not?  Mushrooms crumbled up and were easy to shove in, and nobody really noticed the white lumps until they started to go back.  It was hilarious and Ezekias had totally been asking for it.

I walked into the principal's without knocking and took my customary seat.  ""I'm sorry, Mrs. Biskup, I shouldn't have done it.""

She tisked.  ""You get top marks in your English class, Azel, please use a full sentence.""

I rolled my eyes.  ""I'm sorry I shoved those mushrooms into Ezekias's locker, but he totally had it coming!""

She leaned forward with her elbows on her desk and put her head into her hands for a minute.  ""And that's why,"" she said, looking up at me, ""You're going to be spending your next detention with Mr. Filipowski, cleaning lockers for him.""  She shook her head again then looked at me.  ""I have something special for you, Azel.  You were chosen as one of the test subjects for the new Puberty.""

I'd heard of that, of course, who hadn't?  A machine/body interface that let a person customize their look, to select what they wanted to be like?  My interest immediately peaked and I sat up straighter.  ""Your parents have already agreed,"" she said, ""If you want to, all you have to do is to go to room 108, take some tests and pick what you want on the screen.""

I shrugged, nonchalantly.  Of course I wanted it, but I didn't think that would sound cool to say.  ""I guess that sounds alright.  I could do it.  It gets me out of class right?""

She smiled wearily, ""Yes it would, although you'd still have the normal homework to do.""

I laughed.  Like I bothered doing homework anyway?  ""Ok, well, I guess I should go then?""

She nodded, ""Yes, and don't forget to be here, for your usual Fri night cleaning appointment with Mr. Filipowski.""

I nodded and got out before she could say anything else.  I liked Mr. Filipowski.  He always had a piece of candy for people who helped him clean and it didn't seem like a bad job to have.  I think he made more money than my dad.

I walked into room 108.  There was a little computer sign there with instructions, some lights hanging in one corner of the room, a few machines, and a desk with a computer.  I had to spend an hour taking tests on the computer, then another hour doing physical tests, running on a treadmill, going through a CAT scan, doing other wacky tests.  Then I was directed back to the computer where a human avatar was depicted, just like in the Black Desert Character Creation that had just come out.  It was almost the same too.  I could change everything about the avatar, individual muscles, stance, rotation, size of everything, even how thick my eyebrows were.

I must have spent another hour until I finally had everything the way I wanted it and I clicked the ""Save"" button.  I was going to look pretty awesome.  The printer next to me started spewing sheets into the hopper and I picked them up, wondering how this was all going to work.

As last words from our commander go, they weren't great. The conscription letter came in the mail assuring us with the possibility of victory. Drill Sergeant Blistrich had us drag our 'corpses-to-be' across mud, nail and wire, to grab victory by the nuts and 'Show lady liberty what we were good for.' Yeah, the chance to win was certainly there.

Then the words scrambled like throwing dice. There was equally (in our minds) the chance none of us would win. Or I break a leg and get shipped home. Or the Empire surrenders, we *all* get to go back to the office by Monday morning, and god forbid Marcy clocks the past two months on our pay stubs. 

*The war can't be avoided.*

""Better than who?"" I asked.

""The bitch on EyeNews2,"" he growled. ""You know the one.""

I did. Her eyes were fixed like a shitty bet. Nothing about her moved nor was particularly moving. If she had compelled any humanity to her forty million viewers then most of us would have forgotten. But every soldier remembered the dull, rhythmic nail to our proverbial coffins.

"[WP] Centuries ago, humanity achieved immortality by uploading their minds into an infinite VR simulation. Now, one young mind has discovered physical reality and tries to convince others of it's existence.",OB1_kenobi,"Claude's cell wasn't anything special. Metal bars, an elevated mattress, a corner disposal unit. It was average as prisons go. However, the warden dozing to his left was a surprise. He figured that was just a movie stereotype, but the idea of watching over imprisoned teens eight hours a day felt boring. More so than a math class. For the first time since his arrest hours earlier, the young man's mind reached to another person, and he sympathized for the warden briefly.

Then he hated him. No. He hated everything. Claude couldn't help it; the echoes started that morning, and he was unsettled ever since.

It started with lifting a spoon of damp cereal to his mouth. Teeth clicked the metal, and the sound pulsed through his body. Then the vibration extended from him. He *felt* the table, the tile floors, the dirty microwave. Shocked, Claude dropped the spoon. It was small, but the thundering enveloped him. In his head, his chest, his kitchen, the world pulsed and vibrated.

Then it shattered. 

Claude could still feel the pieces of window and cupboard beneath him as a new sight took away his breath. A charcoal grey that spanned across where the sky used to be. It had always been blue before. And a cold breath pressed into his right. Turning to see what it was, he saw nothing, but it was consistent. Uncomfortable. Relentless. The wind pushed into his face.

For the first time in Claude's life, he breathed.

The kitchen boxed over him in a hurry, jigsaw pieces snapped together seamlessly. Peacefully. The Andrews house sat under the perpetual blue he grew up under. The cold breath was gone. It's absence felt unnatural. He panicked. Shuddering, he grabbed the table for support while taking a step back, pushing his foot deep into the spoon. Claude yelped. The room thundered again. 

His mother rushed for the stairs to see what the matter was. Claude didn't have to hear it. He could feel her feet pounding down steps. Awareness branched from him randomly, nerves and nothing stretching where material tugged on him. Where everything called to Claude.

The world felt more certain, as though it was waiting for Claude to pay attention. Then it roared. His mother lifted the prostrate boy's body, shaking him by the shoulders. When he snapped awake, the burden burst from his mouth;

*""Where the hell are we?""*

The question startled her. ""What do you mean?"" she asked.

Claude's head lulled forward mumbling. It thrust back to her face, screaming. ""*This wasn't real??*"" He could barely hear himself. The roar was a barrage. A gust that would blow him away. Hands clasped to his ears, he howled.

When his mind came together, he found himself being dragged to a police station. Apparently, he was being arrested. Some time passed, he was sure, but Claude didn't bother asking how much. It didn't matter for reasons beyond what he could explain. Time just felt pointless.

Claude lifted his head to the warden once more. *Explaining any of this is, pointless.* A dizzy spell took him briefly, forcing a hand to catch himself on the mattress. In a thud, the world echoed again, then roared in his head.

""Quit that racket,"" a tired warden called out.

The word hung on a thin string in his mind. *Racket.* He grabbed it, and pulled for the life of him. Anything to make it quiet. 

A body flung itself towards his cell and smashed into the bars by the door. Clattering keys dangled blatantly from the unconscious figure's waist. When Claude got up and grasped them in his hand, he made for the door.

Claude paused, and looked around his cell. He noticed nothing special. There were still metal bars. The mattress remained elevated against the wall. The disposal unit still sat in the corner. It was average as prisons go. 

He dropped the keys, and stood in front of a heavy, locked metal door. Claude flicked it with a finger. It rung like a bell, and the door swung open. 

Silence. The world was still. *You get it then?*

Before the beverage was actualized, a round face appeared again over the cubicle. ""Come on, you didn't have a digital signature on it Martin, Ms. Schnelmacher's going to have my---""

He flung the digital document up on the computer with a vertical gesture and slammed an invisible pen into the screen, scrawling in manic cursive two words; Martin Welt. The page disappeared with an aggressive wave. 

Deigning to look at the unimpressive oval of Benji, he was even more vexed by the obvious relief that sat on his face. He didn't even acknowledge Martin's magical command over the machine. Benji's cheeks just sagged over the cubicle divide, with the emotional capacity of a cat satisfied that he was fed, and not much else.

""Done!"" Martin said, making shooing motions at the accountant. The face disappeared as immediately as it arrived, a rapid procession of mechanical thuds on the office floor growing more, pleasantly distant. 

Sitting back once more with his closed eyes, refusing to believe nothing more could disturb this moment, he beckoned for his own satisfaction once more. Hands grew warmer, ceramic certainty coursing through the twined fingers of Martin the administrator. Martin the incarnate magician.

He opened his eyes to witness his apparition. The mug sat warm in his hands. Inscribed on its sides were the words, *Martin, the glorified office bitch.* The only thing preventing his desk from imploding into a vacuous rage was the promise of a hot, sugary beverage that rested on his lap. Sullen, but still breathing steadily, he lifted the mug to his lips.

A tin voice from the department speakers rattled. ""Martin Welt to Ms. Schnelmacher's, can you come up---""

The manager's private office, with her glass conference table and executively furnished space, found itself suddenly occupied by a man on a chair, holding a mug of hot chocolate and unsuppressed desperation.

""Yes Ms. Schnelmacher, what can I do for you?"" he said smoothly, finally taking a sip from his beverage.

She blinked, then spun the large monitor to his view. ""You signed your name in the wrong space."" Her comment flipped a deep switch the administrator did not know he had. ""See, this is why you're still in acquisitions. Simple steps Martin, and you just don't---""

*Boom.* The space in front of her became vacant and scorched. Cosmic echoes shuddered through Schnelmacher's office. She blinked again, leaned over her desk and noticed two particular burn marks. They faintly, but unmistakably formed two words in elaborate cursive;

*I quit.* 

Perplexed, she wouldn't notice until much later that a stockpile of pens in the supply room also disappeared.

I'm feeling over my head now at 4k words in two days. There's balancing the narrative, showing the world and characters while keeping each section or 'chapter' drawing the reader for more. I'm realizing the challenges of making each section stand on its own dramatically as the story develops for the first time. After reading your post, it's less daunting knowing I can go about each part without any set word limit in mind, as long as there's something to keep the reader's attention in a way that's consistent to the story.

I'm a serious believer in showing over telling, even if the moment is prolonged from the first version now.  It was a fun prompt in any case, and I got more out of it than I had originally.

"[EU]Joseph and the virgin Mary decide Jesus is old enough for ""the talk,"" and tell him about where babies come from.",uncletravellingmatt,"I didn't see the conclusion as a summary at first. In my mind it was originally going to anchor more as a short, blunt, natural consequence to Joseph's ""talk."" After reading your critique, I can see how the delivery of that ending punchline sat more on Jesus the character over the narrative, and the writing not accurately reflecting that. So that's where the ""rushed ending"" feeling may come from, and I can acknowledge that interpretation after your critique. An alternate ending could be in order, but I'm going to leave it as is for folks to learn from and take the lesson with me.

To your second point, the prompt asked for ""the talk"", not how Jesus himself was born, so Joseph not directly addressing Jesus' own conception and talking about it more generically felt natural. So I don't get the comment, and I don't believe a reader would be puzzling over Jesus' parentage all that much. I doubt I could make it a puzzle if I tried. Your critique overall though is the most elaborate I've received, and I appreciate you taking the time to read and comment on the responses to your prompt.",Galokot
"[EU]Joseph and the virgin Mary decide Jesus is old enough for ""the talk,"" and tell him about where babies come from.",uncletravellingmatt,"Jesus said unto the Virgin Mary, ""Where doeth babes crawl from?"" Lo, Joseph and Mary exchanged awkward looks. Such event was the heavenly conception of their Messiah that some parenting particulars were overlooked. Thus Joseph of Bethlehem in his patriarchal wisdom said to his wife, ""You tell him."" But Mary answered unto him, ""I did the heavy lifting, this is a father son moment."" 

And Joseph cried up to the heavens, ""O fool that I am, I should have expected this! What am I but simple flesh to take such burdens for our Savior?"" And he wept for ten seconds 'til Mary answered, ""Grow up, he's waiting."" So Joseph relented, and begun his lesson.

He gathered himself and said unto Jesus, ""When married man and woman love each other very much, and can bare nakedness to the other without shame, they."" And Joseph stalled, forming words with his lips without sound. Mary rolled her eyes, while Jesus sat intrigued. Joseph started again, ""You see, it's like a hammer unto wood, or, planks! You lay them missionary,"" Joseph fumbled mightily, ""set a nail down gently before you thrust,"" and thus he struggled.

Jesus looked to Mary and said plainly, ""I don't get it."" Joseph was so enraptured in his carpentry analogy he did not notice Mary had taken the reigns on their son's ceremony. ""A man thrusts in and out of his wife 'til conception."" He said unto his mother, ""Conception?"" Mary nodded in pity. A moment, and Joseph's carpentry analogy clicked in the Savior's mind. ""Sometimes,"" Joseph continued, ""you need to set the nail right, for there is more than one fit,"" and son and wife listened in patient embarrassment.

Lo, once he finished, Jesus called upon John for a second baptism, for he felt unclean.",Galokot

[OT] SatChat: What is the best piece of writing advice you can give?,MajorParadox,"I'm from the PA/NJ area and editing my very first novel for about the 6th time. Once I get through this one, I'm going to look for an agent. So my best piece of advice is this:

Don't worry so much about editing until you have your first draft done. The first draft can be almost incomprehensible because your editing stage starts once that's done. Trust me, editing will happen over and over again. So don't stress so much about it on your first pass writing the novel or short story or whatever it is you're writing.

I also find it helpful to join writers' groups because that will help you get in the mindset for writing. It sparks creativity when you hear other people's stories and it propels you to write more of your own.",QuillCorner

[WP] What happens at the end?,jas0850,"Jordan regained consciousness to find he was standing up and covered by white light.  The ground was white, the sky was white, and nothing but whiteness went on in every direction.  He also found himself all alone.

As soon as the thought entered his mind, another person appeared next to him.  He was an older man, with a white beard, wearing a white shirt and pants.  It was then that he realized he was also wearing similarly colored clothing, although he wasn't sure he was a moment ago.

""This is unusual, isn't it?"" the bearded man asked.

""Yes, it is,"" answered Jordan.  He looked at the older man closely.  ""Heaven, huh?""

""It would appear that way,"" he answered.

Jordan rolled his eyes at the vague response.  *Screw it*, he thought.  He didn't have to play games.  ""What's the meaning of life?"" he asked.

""Oh, a quiz?"" asked the man.  ""The meaning of life is to *find* the meaning of life.  But what do you have to say about it""

""What do *I* have to say?"" said Jordan.  ""I think the meaning of life is something *you* should tell me.  And without the circular logic.""

The old man furrowed his brow.  ""I expected you to have better manners,"" he stated.

Jordan threw his hands in the air.  ""Well, I'm *sorry*, but forgive me for thinking God would be more straightforward with me.  I've obviously died in that car crash and I don't appreciate the mind games.""

""Wait a minute,"" the man started.  ""*You're* not God?  I'm not God either.  My name is Reggie.  I just died too.""

The two looked into each other's eyes.

Reggie stroked his white beard.  ""Why isn't there anyone here to meet us?"" he asked.  ""And where's everybody else?""

""Hi,"" a voice broke into the conversation.  ""I'm here.""

Jordan and Reggie looked down to find a medium-sized yellow lab mix sitting next to them.  They both nearly fell over when it spoke up.

""How long have you two been here?"" the dog asked.

""We just got here,"" answered Jordan.  ""Are- are you God?""

""Close,"" he answered.  ""I'm a dog, not a god.  I can see how you'd make that mistake.  Name's Max.""

""Nice to meet you, Max,"" said Reggie, petting him on the head.

When it comes to being the right place, constructive criticism is part of this sub. Use the [CC] tag rather than [OT]. The rules for that can be found to the right (number 3). Also, adding line breaks in the poem would be helpful for the reader.

As for the poem, it has a lot of interesting metaphors and imagery, and the feelings of love, hope, dependency, and gratitude definitely come through. It is also nice to see the traditional Knight in Shining Armor be a woman. The idea that she fights a battle against your internal demons intrigued me. However, this is a bit buried, even in the short poem, because there are many metaphors and imagery going on that do not fit together. The 'switch of power,' while definitely interesting, comes from a whole different era than swords and knights. Using a key to unlock a door is also different, even in regards to a knight (unlocking a door is not really what we think of knights as doing, even if they would). Magic, your opening idea, is never really brought up again with direct or indirect references. 

Here's my advice (feel free to take it or leave it): go through your metaphors and pick out the one that you think is the best--or even just the one that makes you think the most--then expand it. Perhaps use those dichotomies (using keys not a sword if you go with the knight), but make sure to acknowledge the fact it is a dichotomy and use it to your advantage (why would it be significant that this knight fights with a sword and a key? What does this mean about your SO?). Also consider the poem structure. Rhythm and rhyme are great, but if it seems forced, it is better to go with a free structure poem. You can always come back once your idea is more firmly in place and turn it into a more traditional style poem.

as they lay in the sand made sticky with blood,

in tangles of metal, in shards of glass,

at peace with the wind, and the groans, and the screams

that are muted by eardrums shattered apart,

and shrouded in silence by death.

As the living stumble down streets blocked with tanks 

and craters, and corpses, they blink, and they stare, and they cough

as clouds of smoke attack their eyes and burn their lungs, and steal away the air that once was,

the world that once was,

and leave the living looking like dead.

Only, the dead understand where they are,

for the dead have seen the end of the war.

I've been called everything in the book at this point...and I love it. The booing, the tears and cursing, they all remind me that I've lived to my purpose.

When I say the number 365, what do you think of? The number of days in a year, of course. Every year, from whenever we started counting to today, in 1864, that's how many days have passed. Barring leap years, obviously.

It also happens to be the number of people I've murdered and eviscerated. You see, I'm an artist of sorts. My drawings were never well-received, so I moved onto painting. I kill a man, slice him open and paint the walls a beautiful dark red. Every victim is a new portrait.

Unfortunately, they finally caught me. I did a damn good job of staying anonymous for a long, long time, but great things all have their end. I admitted killing them all, of course- what artist wouldn't take credit for their prized work?

It was an easy decision. The judge only seem flustered that he could not sentence me to more than death, but this is the world we live in. What a petty punishment.

--------------------------------------------------------

I stepped out into the plaza where I was to be hanged. It was a little chilly, but sunny and quite pleasant overall. The crowd was breathtakingly massive- the highest turnout of any public execution.

Beautiful.

For some reason, I was shoved in a chair by the crowd. Perhaps I was to watch a speech about my villainy?

""Get the show started!"" I shouted, laughing and clapping chained hands behind my back.

""As you wish,"" the executioner said. He walked behind the gallow and stepped a woman out.

Breath vacated my chest quicker than I could blink. The only person I'd ever come to love in my life was standing in front of me; a beautiful woman with brown hair and silver eyes. We'd loved each other once, before all this.

""What is the meaning of this?"" I screamed madly, looking around. 

Elizabeth was the first to speak. ""When I heard the news, that you'd been the one who killed all those people, painting my name on the walls....I couldn't bear it. I know death will not be punishment enough for you, and I can't live any longer knowing what you've done in my name."" She was crying.

""Please, no. Please don't,"" I begged.

They slipped her head into the noose.

""NO!""

She fell, then I fell. She died, and I cried.

"[WP] Whenever you get chills, you just died in an alternate universe.",Alekosen,"20 doctors. 15 specialists. Several religious interventions and witch doctors, in Brazil, Peru and Zimbabwe. I've started to lose track of it all.

Nobody can tell my why I won't stop shivering, all throughout the day. There's no pattern- I've counted every day and tried to track one. There's no specific time, and it's not from temperature because it'll happen all year round, rain or shine, snow or sleet. It's not an allergy or a tick...nobody can tell me what it is.

The worst day, I counted 978 shivers. The best was 743. Nothing stops it, not sleep, alcohol, drugs or medicine. I've tried moving around to different places, but nothing works.

I can't have a personal life when I'm shivering all day. I try to see a movie, or go out on a date, or maybe eat at a nice restaurant and no matter what, without fail, I'm interrupted. The joy is tarnished and I'm reminded of my misery.

*God, I'm so tired of the shivers. They won't stop, and it's driving me insane. I hate the feeling, that chill crawling down my spine like a spider. I hate the fact that nobody can tell me why the fuck it won't stop happening.*

*Please, I just want an escape. A way out of this looping hell, where I can't even enjoy a sandwich most days.*

*There is an escape. How could I have missed it? It's so obvious, and it's foolproof. Yes, I'll be free from it. Free at last.*

I put a gun to my head, looking out into a sunset caressing the ocean's horizon with strokes of magenta and pink. The rippling reflection of it on the water was so close I could almost touch it. A most beautiful last sight was before me, so magnificent that it made me doubt my decision. 

I shivered again, my spine screaming madly; could I not even have but one moment of peace to admire beauty? My finger hugged the trigger and I fell into the sea, a splash of red and blue dancing around me in the sunset's hue.

Another shiver ran through my body. *God, why can't I stop shivering?*

"[WP] The humans never suspected, they were the apocalypse.",LoneWords,"Humans have always feared the end of the world; stories of hurricanes and tornadoes swarming, the dead rising to claim the living, seas swelling to swallow land. Perhaps a meteor will destroy us, crushing scampering bodies like ants under foot and encasing our planet in a thick cloud of dust that blocks the sun's warmth. Or, could it be another sickness, so vile and unyielding no medicine can cure it?

And so, we always held fear in the back of our minds. *The apocalypse is coming.* Shelters to survive blasts and sustain life for years were built, just in case. We sliced through forest and harvested animals like crops to sustain our species; to build ourselves as great and perhaps be able to overcome any threat of extinction.

*Nothing can destroy us.* Our strong minds and powerful will would drive us to survive anything nature could throw our way. For that is what we are- we are survivors. That is the trait evolution handed to us. Earth cannot purge us so easily, for we are intelligent, and we are strong. Adaptability is our mantra, and we do not give in without a fight.

Humanity feared the apocalypse, yet it was simply Earth trying to purge a sickness from itself. An infection that destroyed its body and murdered its inhabitants by the billions, poisoning it little by little along the way; a virus without reprieve, reaping its very life.

We feared the apocalypse, yet not once did we stop to think that perhaps, it is us- even as bombs fell, splintering flesh and Earth, fusing them in a mangled mess of sorrow and pain.

In the end, it was not just Earth left slain, but ourselves as well- truly, the pinnacle of destruction. Yet, through fire and smoke, through ash and death, we still could not see it. Those who survived thought the apocalypse was upon *them*, in their ignorance without bliss.

"[WP] Humanity has established itself within the stars. Then, first contact from a sentient alien race is made. They're human.",puterking,"In one quick motion, I slashed the cork from a champagne bottle with my father’s antique sabre, handed down 17 generations to him. It was a brutish thing full of memories most unpleasant, from a lesser time when man was petty and quibbled in the mud like children. Thankfully, they are no more than memories. 

Humanity has matured into adulthood; it’s washed the mud off itself and cleaned up for work- and believe me, there is *plenty* of work to be done. However, for now, we’re celebrating.

“Let us have a toast, eh?” James implored with gleeful fervor. “To Maya: she’s taken us to the very edges of our galaxy, marking humanity’s official inhabitance of the Milky Way. You’re a pioneer, my friend. To celebrate this momentous occasion, let’s bring your cake out. Cake! Cake! Cake!”

The crowd chanted along with him until my secretary, Hamza, peeped his head out of the kitchen doorway, a grin slithering from ear to ear. 

“Let’s see if you’re as good as they say you are, Maya,” Hamza devilishly told me from the hallway. He spun wildly into the room holding a dessert probably four feet in length and one in width. It looked like a chocolate bar.

James laughed. Whatever this was, it was clearly his idea- he only laughs this hard when it’s at his own joke. “You get it? It’s a Milky Way. The candy bar. A pun?” He was trying to spark laughter within me, despite knowing that I’m not one for simple humor.

“You’ve outdone yourself, James. Though, I wonder- couldn’t you have gotten me one of those caramel Andromeda bars? I’ve already conquered the Milky Way.”

“…uh, yeah, I totally thought of that. I just thought this was funnier.” He was clearly lying, as his composure gave away. The cake may have been silly, but his demeanor was enough to make me smile.

“Thank you to everyone here. As you all know, I couldn’t have gotten this far without help from each and every one of you; you’ve all exacted your roles to the maximum. I see a room full of elite professionals who excel at what they do- and, perhaps, a few friends.” I gave a sly smile as I looked around the room, garnering light laughter.

“However, though this may be a celebration of what has come, there is still so much to do. I look forward to breaching beyond the extent of our galaxy with all of you.” I let off the gas for a moment to allow the respectful clapping to diminish.

Before I could continue, however, I was interrupted by a man in uniform, sweating and out of breath. There was a look on his face that left me unsettled by his presence. 

“I’m sorry to ruin your party, ma’am, but you have to come with me to the Exploratorum immediately,” he managed to wheeze out between breaths. I followed him at the quickest pace I could manage in the restriction of heels. 
There were several people waiting inside the Exploratorum- everyone else had been cleared out, which led me to believe something serious was going on. The Exploratorum was a massive wing that connected several hangars; massive polymer panels made it feel like it was an extension of space more than an office. Shiruzen, the general of security, was the first to approach me. 

“I’m sorry to bother you, Ms. Corbin, but as I’m sure you’ve guessed…we have a situation on our hands that demands immediate attention. If you’ll come with me to the Eastern Hangar, I have something to show you.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When I turned the corner into the Eastern Hangar, my breath escaped me. There was a ship unlike anything I’d seen in my life- even in textbooks, *even in cinema*. It wasn’t very big, it could easily fit in a 40 foot cube, but it was made of a strange organic material that seemed chromatic, subtly shifting colors in the light. *It feels like there’s…a presence in this room. An unpleasant one at that.*

“Where did this come from?” I inquired, turning to the General.

“It came from East, at 87 degrees Ascendum. It’s the opposite direction of Andromeda, but beyond that there’s not enough information to discern where it came from. It seems to have jumped midway into our radar’s breadth, as if it teleported.”

“All right, well… I have to ask. Was there anything inside of it? A pilot, or a message?”

“Yes, ma’am. I’ll take you to him right now, he’s in the detaining station upstairs.”

*He?*

We walked up the stairs to the area where all incoming human traffic is managed- no one gets in or out without us fully knowing who it is. The detaining room was a small area we set aside for any security discrepancies- people trying to smuggle anything we disallow on the starship, or anyone misbehaving in general are taken to this room for interrogation.

As I walked up to the door, I peered into the room through a one-way mirror and saw a man sitting at the table. I turned to Shiruzen, furious, and scolded him. “General, you know damn well that anyone in that room must be accompanied by a security officer in uniform. That man you have guarding the captive is dressed plainly and unarmed.”

He cleared his throat, shifting his eyes away from me. “Just step inside, ma’am.”
As he opened the door, a security officer came into view. *Wh…what is the meaning of this?*

I stepped inside and motioned for the guard to step aside. “Where is the pilot of that strange craft in the hangar?”

Shiruzen looked at me, confused, and replied, “He’s sitting right here.”

I looked at the plainly dressed man sitting in front of me. He was lightly toned with short black hair and beautiful dark blue eyes. He was, without any doubt, a human.

“Is this some sort of prank?” I asked him. “Did you alter a standard issue craft to confuse us? Because you should know it is extremely illegal to do so.”

“No, Maya,” he answered. “I’ve come here for you.”

*How the hell does he know my name?*

I turned to the General for an answer, but the look of shock on his face said enough.

“How do you know my name? What is your purpose, and what is that craft?”

“I cannot tell you where I hail from or what my purpose is, but if you promise to remain docile, I can tell you who I am.”

“You are not the one making rules here, but yes, that is a starting point.”

“My name is Sam Corbin. I’m your son.”

“Don’t be preposterous, I don’t have children. I don’t even have a lover.”

“Not yet.” He was looking me straight in the eyes, unfaltering and steadfast. As I stared into those two deep blue oceanic pools, mesmerized by their beauty and an odd feeling of remembrance, something struck me. They seemed so...tired. Worn out, like they'd seen a lifetime of struggle and hardship. Brimming with wisdom and complexity, despite how young he appeared to be. The same eyes I'd remembered looking into as a young woman, listening to age-old stories of war and struggle passed down through the centuries.

*Those are just like my father's eyes.*

I thought long and hard before I blew out the 19 candles in front of me- it took two tries. My little brother came up to me, nagging me to tell him what I’d wished for and started to cry when I refused. *You’re such a little shit, Ben. A cute little shit.* I gave him the soccer ball I’d gotten as a present and told him to play outside.

After a great party with my friends and family, I was sitting in the kitchen, eating a slice of apple pie by myself- apple pie’s probably my favorite thing of all time. 

During my intense, sensual eating session, however, my mother walked in on me.
“Oh dear- I didn’t mean to interrupt you. I had no idea your girlfriend was over,” she said, smirking and pointing at the pie.

“Very funny, Mom. Now please leave so we can have some alone time.”

She smiled. “Happy Birthday, sweetie. You know, now that you’re an adult you should walk over to the Painting and take a look at it. You’re old enough now that it should matter to you.”

“Sure thing, Mom. I’ll go over there and check it out after I finish my pie. You should create another one soon.” Only she knew the password to the house’s Food Creator, so I had to beg for pie.

I’d read about the Painting in school, of course. No one knows why it’s there, or what it does, but ever since the dawn of man here in our world, it’s been there. It never changes; it just sits there, almost like a protector. A lot of people have their theories about it, and some even worship it as a God. You can’t vandalize it, you can’t move it or destroy it…it’s just *there*, with no explanation. It’s really hard to explain, which is partly why so many people give up and worship it instead of trying to understand what it is. 

I put my dirty plate in the washing machine and walked out of the house. It had gotten dark, but a flashlight is more than enough to find your way through town. It’s a very simple, organized town laid out in a grid pattern. Kind of like the painting, no one knows who designed it- the textbooks don’t say. The general consensus is that it must’ve been built before we had written language and documentation of history. Just like everything else, unless its creator intentionally alters or removes it, the creation will remain pristine and unaltered for eternity. Thankfully, whoever made this place decided to leave it intact.

I approached the grand hall in its magnificence. Even in darkness, it was unmistakable- huge, granite pillars so perfectly sculpted into fierce beings not of this world. They had normal eyes, but huge mouths full of sharp teeth and a mane of hair flowing down the sides of their heads. Ears poked upward, sitting atop the head rather than on the sides, like us. No one has been able to figure out what these mythical beasts are, but they are indeed majestic and have an aura of power to them. I’d love to see one in real life someday.

I walked down the massive marble hall and took a seat on a bench. The hall was fairly short and the painting sat on the end of it, taking up the entire rear wall. It left me in awe, seeing something so grand and stoic, though the contents of it were rather dull and odd. It was clearly a room, but the point of view was really odd. It seemed to be from the viewpoint of a metal box, but it had all kinds of buttons and things sticking out of it I’d never seen before. There were two weird chairs next to the box, somewhat askew and disorganized. They had their backs reclined at an angle, almost like you could lay down on them instead of sit on them, but they weren’t as flat as a bed. Thin ropes were dangling from the chairs and seemed to be tied to the metal box- maybe some strange form of decoration? There was a door on the other side of the room, and it was dark. 

That’s all.

I’d brought my textbook with me to do a little reading on what others have written about the Painting. I flipped it open and ruffled through the handwritten pages, thinking about where to start.

I noticed, however, that the picture of the Painting in my textbook was off. It looked a little less dull, a little less grayed out. *Hmm, must be the artist’s style.*
I noticed something out of the corner of my eye. When I looked up, what I saw horrified me.

The painting was moving. There was a person, dressed very strangely and acting bewildered, standing at the back end of the Room. He didn’t touch anything, he just looked around, like he’d lost something.

It took a second for me to scream. “SOMEONE, COME LOOK!”

I ran out into the street and woke up the neighbors. I called them over to see the man in the painting, but when we got there, he was gone. Vanished. Everything looked the same as it always had.

“Please, son, we’re trying to sleep. These kinds of pranks aren’t funny,” my old neighbor pleaded of me.

“I swear, there was a man in the Painting! I swear it!” I was desperate.

My mother walked up to me. “Oh, darling. Perhaps you’re still too young. Come, let’s get some sleep.”

I stood there in shock and began to cry. When I got home, I locked myself in my room, angry that the Painting would betray me so. How could it be so cruel to me?

Then it dawned on me. 

*Maybe the Painting isn’t what we think it is.*

Morkrut was scavenging for food again, since everything he'd gathered for his family had run empty. He decided to try a new area today, since most buildings and plants had been picked dry of their contents. Life had become miserable ever since the Great Vanishing almost 100 years ago, when most of the population disappeared.

*I need to hit the jackpot today, or we're fucked.*

He walked out into the Nevada desert and fought through harsh winds cutting him with sand. He wrapped a shirt around his face and wore the baggiest shawl he could find. Morkrut was operating on a rumor, but that rumor was the best option he had at this point.

Legend has it that, through the harsh desert, there's a small city full of food and water. Some say they could see it with binoculars, off in the distance as a tiny dot. A paradise for any who can brave the travel, though no one was insane enough to try so far. *If I die trying, at least I tried.*

After several hours of walking, his bare feet raw from the sand and his skin sunburnt, he stumbled into a small grouping of buildings. *I've found it. I've found Paradise in Hell.*

He walked over to them and stumbled inside of the first one. It was a dark, empty room that only had several chairs and a machine whirring at the end of it. There were several screens that had been turned off and a camera in the corner of the left-hand display.

After a quick look inside, he realized there was nothing in there his family could eat and promptly ran back outside to search the remaining buildings.",resonatingfury

I weightlift twice a day, bench 600 pounds, deadlift 1430 and squat 950. I'm known as the Human Boulder, because once I set myself in place, nothing will move me. 

Because of this, my job prospects are incredible. The weaker people get to do things like take care of the elderly or the homeless, be chefs and teachers or artists...but guys like me? We get the real jobs, because we can handle the weight. I decided to go with the route that would yield me the most money- Missile Operator. If the time ever comes to launch any kind of large scale attack, nuclear or otherwise, I push the finalize button. 

Which is what made it all so surprising when my partner turned out to be a small woman in her 30s. When she was firsr assigned to me, I thought it was a joke. 

""Don't you think you're gonna get crushed by all this?"" I asked, concerned for her health.

""I'll be fine,"" she replied with a smile.

She always smiled. Even when we were called in as an emergency, during the nuclear war in 2047, she was smiling at me as we looked at the switch. In the briefing room, we were told that the weight of this assignment would be enough to kill whoever pressed the button. I told him I could handle it, because I'd been training for this day. We were doing this to protect our country, we were told. This was necessary. This was my job.

However, when we were there, at the button, I was scared. Millions would die, across the world, and the weight of that would be on me. It might actually kill me, despite my strength. With the weight of the world on my back, it was possible even I would crumple. My finger hovered over the button, shaking.

She smiled at me again and grabbed my hand, pushing me aside. I looked at her in confusion and awe as she pressed the button herself. She smiled at me again, before crumpling to the ground. 

""Why?"" I asked her, crying unknowingly. ""Why didn't you let me do it?""

""It would have killed you, and I can tell that you were scared. This job is not for your kind and soft heart,"" she replied softly, life fading from her.

She was right. If it killed someone as strong as her, I would have surely died. She saved my life that night, and I resigned to work as a teacher, hoping to help raise children like her, and not like myself.

Van Gogh smiled, hands on his hips. 

*This is going to be a timeless piece, I can just tell.*

He looked out the window, into a meadow of blue petals dotted with argum, and took a deep breath, exhaling slowly.

How do you describe a color, after all? Our descriptor words are based on the colors we see, not the other way around. It's very different than blue or red; to me, it's more beautiful than any of the others. 

It's only natural I became a fan of art- after all, I have a gift that no human being has been given. Sometimes I spot the color, which I call 'argum', in random places. Oftentimes in nature, it's splashed across a tree's leaves or dotted into a flowers petals. I'm often saddened by the remembrance of humanity's incapable eyes, unable to see such marvelous beauty.

I've scoured many art galleries, hoping to find a trace of this color somewhere, in some obscure painting. Be it by accident or intent, it would be a fascinating discovery.

Despite the fact that I was desperately searching for it, shock still slapped me when I finally found it. What surprised me, however, is that it was not an obscure painting, or some strange accident unintended by the artist. It was fully intentional, and it had meaning.

Van Gogh's *Starry Night* is a wonder to the world, and one of the most prominent pieces of artwork in history. It is certainly beautiful, as all can see clearly.

But every so faintly brushed into certain strokes of those swirly stars were lines; I'm assuming that to everyone else, they don't stand out at all. As I peered closer, I could vaguely make out words formed from them.

'*Help me*'.

Further down, there was a bit more hidden in the cityscape.

'*They come for those who See*'.

I recalled reading about Van Gogh's madness, near the end of his life, and immediately welled with fear.",resonatingfury

I guess depends on the Rubric, but honestly, most places I think your points would count very little.

&gt;He never actually defines what modernism or postmodernism is, and its not hard to do so. 

and if it's so easy, 4/10 essays are going to give the same bland textbook sort of definition and those are the ones which will have no original thought. 6/10 essays are going to skip it, because, as you say below, it's more of a sociological matter to define it anyway, and might be irrelevant to the point.

&gt;Instead he just makes up vague ""reasons"" and applies them to each concept, even though they're wrong, and compares them. 

Except, no one said if this was a philosophy essay, or a sociology essay, or a literary one. Reasons that appear vague for one course of study could be insightful in others, and whether they are right/wrong could depend on who you are talking to.

Maybe the assignment was to make your own interpretations and compare them.

&gt;You can obviously tell he didn't read any required text 

What required text? I mean honestly this looks like any generic essay that could fit any of 1000 different topics. 

&gt;and has no grasp of Marxist theory - he sort of gets Rousseau right, but only barely. 

Except people - even purported ""experts"" are *widely* conflicted on both of those.

&gt;More importantly, however, is that ""Modernism"" and ""Postmodernism"" are more sociological terms, and not philosophical terms, which he seems to be getting mixed up. 

And there's a lot of overlap between the two. As you said:

&gt;If the assignment was to apply them to philosophical thought on the freedom of man, then it becomes a little clearer,

And since it's well written, and *fairly* correct, grammatically, we're looking at about half of the requirements for most rubrics. 1) It's concise, 2) Grammar and spelling 3) He gives examples 4) Sources are (presumably) cited correctly 5) He shows independent (""wrong"") reasoning 6) He effectively compares/contrasts his views....

I mean we're looking at at least a C, and a D is still passing (though not great)

&gt;but its still easy to sniff the bullshitting.

""How the **** am I supposed to find it, now?! It's a goldfish in the freaking ocean!""

""Goldfish only live in freshwater.""

""So you're telling me it's dead?""

""No I'm telling you, you don't even know what sort of fish it was.""

So in the end of the chapter you're at the end of the story ""There it is! I've finally got you!"" and then a big shark swims threateningly toward you and you swim away as the fish squirms out of your hand.

In the first chapter the character gets a magic ring. And mom says she will kill him if he loses it. He goes fishing, and the ring falls in water and just got is swallowed by a fish. 

Next chapter is a story where a guy comes and shows him how to swim underwater, and they are chasing the fish and they catch it. But they drop it when a bigger fish comes charging. The bigger fish eats the first one.

Chapter 3 - New story with a guy and his pal and chasing a (bigger) fish again. And on and on till the biggest fish is a whale. Or a shark. Or something. 

Then there's a chapter that's a story about finding and killing a shark

But you aren't done because the next chapter is story that hero have to cut open the whaleshark and all the other fish to find the ring! But it's not there! But oh wait, yes it is.

And then the last chapter is story where he carry the ring home, along with lots of fish for dinner, and mom is so happy she bakes him a cake for dessert.

It is funny, though, because we were talking about it, not about chapters, but about the hero's journey thing from the Thursday Theme. :P

[WP] The UK is being battered by a major storm. Write the story of someone desperately trying to make it home from work during the chaos.,Beed28,"""Well fuck you, I quit.""

Mason packed up his belongings in a tiny cardboard box and left the building where he worked for the last 14 years. He made his way down to the parking lot fumbling for his keys with one hand and trying to balance the box with the other. 

""Its about good time someone told that man to sod off. He been in a pain in my arse ever since he got here.""

That was Brian he was talking about. Mason's new boss transferred in from America. They didn't really get along and lets just say today was the final straw.

""Expendable resource my bloody arse. I'll show him who's expendable"" said Mason as he got into his 2001 Vauxhall Cors and slammed shut the door. He revved up his engine and exited the lot making his way home just like he did for the past 14 years. 

*The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has issued a 4 tier storm warning to everyone in and around Edinburgh. Residents are advised to stay at home until further notice is given. Now back to your favourite tunes.*

""Fuckin' great! And I thought this day couldn't get any better."" Ironic as it is, his car broke down that very moment. Stepping out of his vehicle Mason looked up to the skies, dark grey and stormy, they seemed to reflect his inner thoughts. ""I guess I'll have to walk home now.""

Within 5 minutes all hell broke loose. Mason struggled to keep his eyes open as the cold harsh wind hit his face. He could swear he heard laughter in the wind, almost as if the universe was mocking him. Each step took immense effort. It almost felt like he was going no where. 

At that moment, everything that happened that day came crashing down on him. He felt a fear he never had before. What would he do without a job? What would his wife say? Would his car be stolen? But most of all, Mason feared that he wouldn't make it home for some reason. The raging storm seemed to increase his already pacing heartbeat. Black Sabbath would proud.

""Are you crazy bruv? Get over here before something kills you!"" 

Mason looked to where the sound came from. A young man, possibly in his twenties, stood near a bakery shop gesturing for him to come in. Mason didn't bother. Somehow it felt right to be in this storm. In any case, just a few more steps and he'd be in his house. He sensed the familiar neighbourhood even though he couldn't see within an inch of his hand. 

Walking blindly around in the white storm, something within Mason began to appreciate the storm. ""Calm within chaos was it called?"", he pondered. The storm seemed to echo the very essence of his life. 

Finally, he found himself standing on his porch and entered his little home. He brushed the snow off his coat, made himself a hot cup of tea and looked outside the window.

 The storm had finally calmed and settled down, and Mason had a feeling his life would too.

[WP] The world experiences its first superpowers due to a chemical blast. Write a story about these first people.,stiefelism,"
Its been a month since the blast happened. Genesis they called it. Apparently the word stood for the 'origin' of something. I didn't give a fuck. The name sounded ironic to me anyway. It might have given birth to a new breed of humans, but it took away my one purpose of existence. 

I wasn't sure who to blame for Kate's death. The newspapers reported that the cause of the explosion was two factored. On one hand, the population blamed the terrorist group responsible for the detonation. On the other, they blamed the government for carrying out illegal experiments at the site of that explosion. It didn't matter anyway. They were both gonna pay. For Kate's sake. 

-------------

**NEWS FLASH**

**The American Government has released the name of the rumored 'superhero' that played a major part in the latest counter terrorist operations ever since Genesis. More to follow only on Fox News.**

I watched his smug face address the crowd. I watched him as he told the crowd how the explosion gave him super-strength, his instant reflexes and that fucking wave of golden hair on his head. I watched him as he covered for the government saying that the explosion only happened because of terrorist intervention. I watched him as he told the world that 27 people died in the laboratory that day

I guess the explosion didn't give Mark (AKA The Patriot) super intelligence. 26 people died that night. My Kate was one of them. She should've been the one who survived. She was the one who everyone loved. **SHE SHOULD'VE BEEN HERE INSTEAD OF ME.**

As I watched the crowd of ignorant people cheering for their hero, I found another purpose. I knew what I had to do. I'd destroy whoever was responsible for those 26 deaths. Those deaths were mine to carry. Mine to avenge. That was MY KATE THEY KILLED. And with the powers I now had. No one, not even the damn Patriot could stop me.

---------- 

Hacking into electronics was just one of the few dozen powers I got since the blast. I woke up to new ones everyday, but I didn't really try all of them. I only focused on the one power that would help my cause. The power to manipulate the speed of time.

    HACK SUCCESSFULL. 

    OPERATION EAGLE DETAILS

They were scheduled to be dropped off at Baghdad at 0800 hours. Military intelligence seemed to suggest that that was where the terrorist group was set up. Sneaking onto one of the two MiG-29s wouldn't be a problem. Genesis gave me invisibility after all. And Operation Eagle was led by the Patriot. Perfect. It was time Mark and I had a chat. 

---------------

I narrowly missed bullet after bullet, slowing down time to carefully plan my next move. Speeding it up to snap their necks before they even realised that they were dead. I didn't have to think though. Kate guided me. I didn't see the bullets whiz by, I didn't hear the sound of metal being driven into the bodies of those bastards. But I felt the red spray on my face as I shot each and every one of those vile creatures. And I liked it. The spray of Kate's blood was the last thing I remembered of her. Each time I felt someone's blood on my skin, in a weird way, it brought me closer to her. 

I finally made it through to the leader. He wasn't the stereotypical terrorist leader I had expected.A clean shaven, brown haired, white man. But then again, my only expectation was to kill him. I put a gun to his head and told him to say his prayers. I could've choked him to death, maybe even exploded his mind from within, but I wasn't one of them was I? A clean death would be justice enough.

Mark burst through the door. Fucking spandex, cape and all. If Kate saw him like this she surely would've fell to the floor laughing. Kate....

""Stop this Ian, this isn't right. We need him alive."" Every word he spoke filled me with rage. Why did he get to decide who lived? ""I know you blame him for Kate's death. But let the government deal with him Ian. We can help you too.""

""**THE GOVERNMENT HAS DONE ENOUGH**"" My voice shattered every glass window within 50 miles. I saw fear fill the Patriot's eyes as he understood just how powerful I was. ""They did this to her. And now they have to pay.""

""Ian"", he looked at me, with...was that pity in his eyes? ""Killing one murderer doesn't reduce the number of murderers in this world.""

I chuckled. Maybe Genesis finally gave him the common sense he always lacked. 

""You're right."" I said, raising my free hand towards him. ""But killing two does.""

As their new relationship blossoms, they begin to remember everything- the good and the bad.",iambookfort,"**They say true love only happens once in a lifetime. Then why do I have this feeling that I've met her before? Why do I feel like I've known her all my life when in reality, we just met 2 weeks ago. It must have something to do with my memory, I've had it since I was a kid. But these feelings that Catherine makes me feel, how could I ever forget that?**

*They say that when you're born, a red twine is tied around your ankle and your lover's. Its said that no matter what fate has in store, these two people will always meet. I know Jake must have the other end of my red twine. But a voice in my head tells me I felt this way before. I don't remember much after the accident. I've grown to trust my instincts and my instincts tell me I love him*

**She's beautiful. I'd say I've never seen anything as beautiful as her but that would be a lie. Bits and fragments come to me now and then. Us lying down on the grass, listening to Ed Sheeran songs. Us lying down on a sofa, kissing each other. I remember the physical memories much clearer. I remember kissing her real hard, wanting more of her every time. She really is beautiful.""**

*I know for sure we've met before. I get flashes of our past relationship. It happens quickly and I zone out. Jake asks me if I'm alright and I say yes, but I know I'm not. In truth, the memories scare me a little. Sure, there are the good ones. Memories in which we look like the perfect couple. Each completing the other. Hands intertwined, walking down Broadway, staring at the clothes on display, laughing at how ridiculous it would be if Jake wore them. Those are the good ones. Then there are the memories that scare me, memories that bring a fear that I felt before. I see Jake getting angry at himself for not remembering little things. I remember him pushing me away when I got close to comfort him. I remember being scared.""*

**I know I love Catherine. I know the past me did too. I love that fate brought us together once again. I honestly don't know why we ever were separated in the first place. But she seems cornered now. Not like the Catherine I knew before. I look into her eyes and I see glimpses of a past fear. But I wouldn't hurt her. Not my Catherine. All my memories of her were beautiful, I wouldn't want to lose her. My most vivid memory of her was her in a beautiful red dress. She looked gorgeous that day, and I couldn't stop telling her how much I loved her. I hope time binds us together forever.**

*I know I loved Jake,I know the past me did too. But I fear for myself now more than ever. A voice in the back of my head keeps telling me I should back out while I have the chance. I don't remember how we broke up in the first place. But I do have one very clear memory. I remember lying on the floor, looking up at his face. I couldn't move even if I tried, my body wouldn't listen. I remember a shade of red pouring on the floor. And then I remember nothing more.*

*eeeoooeeeooo-eeeoooeeeooo-eeeoooeeeooo*

The sirens blared as police cars whized by 24 Oaker Street. The Rich Bitch Bank of England had a silent alarm go off just minutes ago. Witnesses say they saw a white haired she-hulk, wearing yellow spandex, carrying bags of cash from the bank. 

*BOOM*

People ran in fear and confusion like hookers on a Black Friday deal (what does that even mean?). MotherFucking Russia lifted a cop car and brought it smashing down on another. Damn this girl was on some GI-Jane level shit. 

*Enter the R-Squad*

**""Stop right there MotherFucker.""** Tyrone looked to his teammates and said, **""Wooho. I've always wanted to say some Samuel L. Jackson shit like that!""**


*""Vot is dat yu vant,little black man. Did daddy run away again?""*

**""Ay yo. Enough with the dad jokes a'ight? Can't a brother fight crime in peace? Look here you beautiful white haired bitch, come with us peacefully and we'll even let you join us after a few years in white girl rehab.""**

*White-Trash-Girl's defence fell.*

""Oy-vey and we could maybe keep some of that געלט yes?""

**""Shut up Miser-Man, I do the talking around here.""**

*For some reason, WildBeast is silent, he stares at MotherFucking Russia. He imagines sucking on those beautiful bulging biceps of hers. A picture forms in his head, a land of unicorns and ponies, and only him and her. Russia and France, making sweet sweet love.*

""Oui, Elle est vraiment une beauté . Tenez -moi dans tes bras virils , mon amour.""

*MotherFucking Russia wasn't sure what WildBeast said, but deep within her she felt something melt. Some part of her knew this was wrong. That her years in the KGB trained her to resist these kinds of feelings, but then, how could something so wrong feel...so right?*

""Yallah, Yallah! Let us get this over with habbibi? 

أحتاج إلى أن أكون في المطار ست ساعات في ""وقت مبكر ل TSA

""Mr. T-Dawg san, you know we no have the real powers yes?""

**""Wait. WHAT? SAY THAT AGAIN""**

""We don't got no powers lassie, or you bunch of mankies don't. Toodle-doo""

And with those words, Duff-Man shot into the sky, a glorious rainbow emanating from his even more so glorious Irish behind. 

**""My nigga""**
