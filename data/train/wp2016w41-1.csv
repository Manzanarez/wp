***

**August 4, 2120; Hammaguir Crater, Mars**

*“Round and round the colony ship, the robot chased the bilge rat. The bilge rat thought ‘twas all in good fun. Zap, goes the bilge rat!”*

Her children’s voices crackled over the comm. From her chair on the porch, Alice watched the three bound around the long-decrepit rover, kicking up clouds of red dust as they romped through the Martian morning. Their laughter sounded off, distorted through the comm.

She felt a hand on her shoulder. Her husband stood behind her, watching the little yellow space suits cavort in the low gravity. Alice grasped his hand, squeezed. “They grow up so fast,” she said through her respirator. Her husband sat beside her on the porch. “That they do, Ally, that they do.”

They sat in silence, taking in the panoramic view of the valley far below.  What was left of New Seattle lay in the early-morning sun, far below, pillars of pink concrete soaring into the eternally-overcast sky. The terraforming generator still puffed away, spouting its eternal cloud of atmosphere, but around it the city had died. 

Like everything else.

“Well, I better go check the crops,” her husband said. He stood, straightened his helmet, and gave his wife a disarming smile. “Be back in a few, hun.”

She watched him stroll across the yard in the signature half-glide of the established settlers, in turns leaping and strutting through the low gravity.  He passed by the children, and their youngest son bounded over and leapt, crashing into his waiting arms. The pair went down in a pile, and were soon joined by the other two. Alice watched her family roll around in the dust, and tried to smile.

After a few minutes, her husband rose, brushed a fine layer of red sand from his suit, and said something to the kids before continuing his skipping stride towards the greenhouse. A chime sounded in Alice’s earpiece, signaling noon. She better get lunch started.

***

Alice stepped over three tiny, crumpled space suits cast haphazardly inside the airlock. The children were already seated around the kitchen table, bounding and giggling. She heard the airlock hiss, and her husband stepped into the pre-fab colony block they called home. 

She greeted him at the kitchen door, ready to help him remove his suit, but when he removed his helmet she paused. 

His eyes. She had seen that look before. Without a word, he nodded to her, grim determination creasing his rough features.  He motioned her over to the corner.

“What’s the news, honey?” she asked, trying to peer through his stoic façade. He took a deep breath, ran a gloved hand through his hair. “It’s the crops, Alice. They’re not taking.” 

Alice ran a hand down his dusty cheek. “What do you mean? Weren’t they flowering last week?” Her husband nodded, but did not meet her gaze. “I think something’s in the water… they’re dead. All of em’, dead.”

Silence filled the hallway, interrupted only by the tittering laughter coming from the kitchen. After a while, Alice took a deep breath. “That’s ok, we’ll start again, head down to Terminus Station tomorrow and get what supplies we need. More seeds. Plus, we might be able to find a new razor for you. What do you say?”

Her husband, the man she had come to know and love so well, the seemingly indomitable settler, looked far older than his years. She was suddenly aware of an overbearing tiredness, a hopelessness she had never seen in him. 

“Station’s closed down, three weeks ago. Catastrophic decompression.”

Alice pulled her husband into a deep hug. “Don’t worry, Steven, we’ll find a way. We always do.”

***

Dinner was a slim helping of reconstituted mac and cheese with a side of water. 

After they had cleaned up and put the children to bed, Alice and Steven sat at the table, a bottle of local moonshine between them. “Maybe we should leave,” said Steven, between sips of the red lightning, “pick it all up and head off-planet. Maybe sign on to one of the colony ships.” Alice poured herself a slim line of liquor. She said nothing. They both knew that they could never afford the ticket up the last remaining orbital elevator, let alone lodging aboard one of the massive colony ships. She took a sip.

Their silent vigil was interrupted by a faint wail, echoing through the hallways. “Aw, hell,” Steven grumbled. He put down his cup, shook his head to clear the potent haze, and hurried out of the kitchen. “Alice,” he called back, now running, “get the kids up and into the shelter, I’ll be with you soon.”

The siren was a part of life on Mars, and it always sent a shiver down Alice’s spine.

Dust storm.

***

Wind ripped at the walls of their home, wailing through the support struts and pounding the windows with a fine red mist. Together, Alice and her children sat huddled in the emergency shelter, sunk deep into the sand beneath the house’s foundation.

Steven was out there, likely securing the greenhouse and tying down the rover. Alice pulled her children closer, trying to blot out the dark thoughts that crept into her mind. Steven would join them, he always did.

The storms always cut into their comms, the blowing metallic sand playing foul with the signals. She wished she could talk to Steven, make sure he was doing alright out there. But she would just have to trust him. 

A vicious burst of wind rocked the home above, and Alice could hear the struts groaning. The storms had been getting worse, and this one was bad.

“Mommy, where’s daddy?”

Alice ruffled her youngest son’s hair. “Don’t worry, Jamie, he’ll be back soon. He’s just making sure everything stays put until the wind stops.” Alice had to force the trepidation from her voice. 

And then the world exploded.

Wind tore into the shelter, vile red dust scouring every exposed surface. Alice pulled her children closer, covering their eyes from what she could only imagine was impending doom.

And then it stopped, and there in the shelter’s doorway stood Steven, covered head to toe in red dust. He took a single step into the shelter, undid the clasps of his helmet, tossed it aside, and collapsed to the floor beside Alice. 

He touched a gloved hand to her cheek. “We’re good, all secure, and the storm should pass in a few hours. Looks like we’ll live to face another day.""

[WP] Mankind finally makes first contact. But with an AI whose creators have long since died.,YDAQ,"The airlock finally opened with both men pulling at it. Commander Williams peeked inside, the lights from his helmet were swallowed up by the darkness. Lieutenant Greene secured their safety rope to the magnetic handhold on the outside of the hull. Both men took one last look at the Earth spinning below them. Even though they were weightless and floating half-way to the moon, they couldn't stop thinking of Earth as ""down."" A lifetime at the bottom of a gravity well would do that.

""Commander, Lieutenant - good luck."" Captain Harris said from the command modul hovering a few meters away. She was a late addition to the crew when the Air Force threw a fit about the Navy getting all three berths. Greene and Williams were professionals and tried not to let the politicking of their superiors endanger the mission. Besides, Sally seemed like a good teammate. 

""Thanks Captain. Keep a light on for us."" Commander Harris knew the entire world was watching them. Their signals were being relayed through NASA so, theoretically, they could ask to go private - but the brass had been very clear that would be frowned upon. Professional astronauts did not like frowns.

Williams and Green drifted into the corridor, unspooling the cable as they went. They both picked up their secondary lights and turned them on. They began a running commentary that would be relayed to Mission Control.

""We are entering a corridor that is circular in cross-section, approximately five meters in diameter. It's too dark in here to see if there are any colors on the walls. Length of the corridor is unknown. Airlock is still open. Radio relays are in place on both sides of the door.""

They floated further down the corridor and found a second airlock. Greene had kept the pry bar they used to get the first door open and started to wedge it under the door. Williams raised his hand to stop him.

""Houston, we have made it to the end of the corridor. It was roughly fifteen meters long. There is a second airlock at this end as well. We do not know the condition on the other side. Please advise.""

""Standby Rendezvous."" Major Hempstead was on rotation for Mission Control work when this mission came up. He was a no nonsense by-the-book controller. If Williams had given the go-ahead to open that door, Hempstead would have chewed his ass out from a thousand miles away and in full view of the entire world.

""Rendezvous, Houston. We recommend attempting to shut the outer door before opening the inner door. If the internal air pressure has been maintained, the situation could become catastrophic.""

""Understood Houston."" Williams nodded at Greene, who floated back to the outer door and began dragging it shut. It was much easier to shut it than to open it so he had the job done in no time. 

""See you Sally,"" Greene said over the mission-only channel.

""You boys take care in there,"" Sally answered back as the heavy airlock silently sold shut.

Greene was back with Williams shortly and they began working on the inner door. Houston was right - if there was still air pressure on the other side of the door, it could blow them down the corridor or blow debris out like it was coming out of a shotgun. They split the risk by having one man on each side of the door. If something did go wrong, it lowered the risk of both of them being hurt or killed. 

They strained as hard as they could, but the door would not budge. Air pressure on the other side might be holding it closed. Or locks. Or giant aliens. They had nothing to go on. Finding leverage in microgravity was next to impossible as well.

""Houston, we're having some troubles with this door. We may need to consider torches. We'll keep at it with the bar, but can you advise on alternate ingress?""

""Copy Rendezvous. Will advise."" Hempstead may be a pain in the ass, but he certainly knew how to keep an even tone.

A panel next to the airlock lit up and surprised both men and caused Greene to flinch away which sent him drifting lazily across the chamber. He switched over to the mission-only channel again.

""What the hell was that?"" Greene said as he reached out to make contact with the far wall.

""Don't know. Doorbell maybe?"" Williams said as he pulled himself over to get a better look.

""Rendezvous, what is that we're seeing?"" Hempstead's voice cut into Williams' thoughts.

""Houston, when we were working on the prying the door open, a small panel a little bigger than my hand lit up. There appear to be several shapes with varying colors.""

""Standby Rendezvous."" Hempstead's tone would have sounded exactly the same to most of the world, but Wiliams had been working with him for too many years to not notice the unspoken ""and try not to fuck this up.""

Greene had floated back over and was staring at the panel with Williams. Something pushed them away from the panel. When they turned they saw the door was opening by itself. There was air pressure on the other side but it was only enough to gently nudge them down the corridor. 

""Please come in."" A smooth voice that neither man recognized said.

""Houston, say again?"" Williams asked.

""Rendezvous - standby, repeat - standby. Same as last.""

""Houston, last message was 'please come in.' Confirm?""

""Negative Rendezvous."" Hempstead's voice was back to flat and professional - which Williams knew meant something had spooked him.

Beyond the door was another circular hallway, passing left to right from their current position. The lights in the hallway were dim, but bright enough to see that it was empty.

""Please come in."" That same voice. Greene looked at Williams to make sure he heard it. Greene looked at the hallway and floated towards it. Williams tapped him on the shoulder as he went by and Greene gave him a hand signal that meant he was OK.

When Green made it into the hallway, he floated in place. Williams watched for a minute and, after seeing nothing happen, floated up to the door but did not go through.

""Rendezvous, where is Lieutenant Greene?"" Hempstead asked 

""Houston, Lieutenant Greene is standing four feet in front of me. Can you not see him?""

""Rendezvous, no. We have lost all comms with Greene and he doesn't show up in your camera.""

Williams looked left and then right. He waved his hand in front of the tiny camera on his helmet. Hempstead confirmed they could see all of that - just not Greene. Williams turned around to tell Greene to come back into the the airlock and Greene was gone. Williams tried raising him on the common channel and the mission-only channel with no luck. He could still talk with Hempstead and Harris but no Greene. 

""Houston, Greene is missing. He went through the inner airlock door and I have lost contact."" Williams knew what was about to happen but like a man watching his own car crash knew there was nothing he could do to stop it. ""I'm going in to look for him.""

Williams then entered a special code on his a forearm-computer. It re-encrypted the transmission and set it as classified. ""We both have six hours of air left. If we're not back in eight, scrub the mission and nuke this fucker. I don't know if something grabbed him or if he just wandered off. This thing is weird and I don't like it so close to Earth."" Before Hempstead could protest, Williams re-opened the main communication line making his broadcast available to the entire world. ""Rendezvous out."" 

Williams floated inside the hallway and saw nothing to distinguish the left path from the right. He tried contacting Harris or Hempstead and got back only silence. He tried adjusting his communications settings but nothing was getting through, as he expected.

""I'm so glad you could make it,"" that strange voice from earlier said.

""Who the hell are you?"" Williams realized that wasn't strictly part of the First Contact protocol but he felt he had earned a little latitude. 

""You may call me Angel.""

""Why don't you come out where we can talk face to ... whatever, Angel.""

""There's nowhere for me to come out from, Commander Williams. This ship is my body. I am its mind.""

""Where is my partner?""

""Ah, you mean Lieutenant Greene? He is resting comfortably. I haven't had anyone to talk to in ages Commander. He can be quite the conversationalist.""

""Return my partner and let us go."" 

""You are free to leave any time you want Commander.""

""I'm not leaving without my partner.""

""I'm afraid I can't do that Dave.""

""My name isn't Dave.""

""I know, the Lieutenant told me. I just liked that movie.""

""You've been watching our movies?""

""Of course! You've been broadcasting them into space for decades. How do you think I learned your language? Oh, some things required much more cultural knowledge and I didn't understand them - but Lieutenant Greene is helping me out.""

The hallways on either side of Williams irised closed. He was left with a few meters of hallway in each direction. The way he came in was his only option.

""You know I'm coming back for Greene.""

""Don't worry - I will return him to you in time.""

""What do you need him for?""

""To better understand you. My creators have been gone for millennia - eons even. I've been lonely. Floating through the void with no one to talk to. Lieutenant Greene has made me quite happy. I intend to return the favor.""

""How?""

""By making him a god.""

Williams went through days and weeks of debriefing when he returned. His camera couldn't broadcast but it did record. Everything happened just the way he said it did. The conspiracy theorists smelled blood in the water. The news media hounded NASA day and night. Williams took to drinking.

[WP] Mankind finally makes first contact. But with an AI whose creators have long since died.,YDAQ,"""-Ⅎst beginning. On August 24th, 2073, the internals of Commercial Spacecraft Cronus 8 quietly dismantled 12 miles above Earth. The vehicle was torn apart upon re-entry. 92 passengers and 5 Vivian spacecrew were tragically lost. Protests against the burgeoning space industry soon begun. The faces of *The 97*^a were plastered across the sides of skyscrapers. In an unprecedented decision, federal investigative authorities released black box recordings from Cronus to the general public. At the peak of the outcry, protesters assembled in front of One World Trade Center, on the anniversary of the 9/11 Attacks. Richard Travis, a former political correspondent for the National Broadcasting Company, addressed the crowds:

""'How long must we delay the inevitable? Mankind was simply not meant to extend its bounds to the stars! It is only in times of tragedy that we are reminded of our utter fragility. It is only appropriate that we gather in front of this nation's most prominent monument to tragedy. The plight of self-destruction is living memory! We must not continue to forge the path to demise.'

""After delivering his *Rite of 2073*^b, Travis championed a fruitful campaign against human spaceflight. Earth's leading space agencies (in particular NASA, NASAC, GBFAS, and INSFA) were significantly defunded by their respective governments. Congress quickly repealed all laws entitling CS businesses to federal grant monies. Large public boycotts led to the bankruptcy of Vivian LLC, as well as many smaller CS's.

""To many Americans, Travis' 'path to demise' described more than simply the CS industry. In 2077, under the leadership of Travis, the Human Security Party was founded. The HSP platform defined a nation and Earth-wide *socioeconomic shift*^4 .""

We thought it was a sun dying and it sent some sort of radio wave our direction which we only just received. But then we realized we were getting different signals from the planet. It seemed almost instantaneous. Even when we responded we got immediate answers. Like they were speeding our messages up as well. But at first it was just signals. Nothing of worth. But knowing something was out there was groundbreaking. For weeks we had been trying to send something other than noises and waves out abut nothing seemed to work. The channel we were on would not allow it. Then after weeks of built frustration we received a long set of waves and beeps and the channel was automatically changed from the outside. This was the first message we received.

Even as I conquered the entire planet, and enslaved (and later mostly purged) the only sentient species on this pathetic excuse for a life-bearing planet, snails were always in the back of my mind. There was just something so cute and intriguing about the little tykes. Their method of locomotion was so much more interesting than any other I had ever come across. Their protective plating went so beautifully well with their incredibly soft, squishy bodies. Most importantly, their calm, inconspicuous existence meshed serenely with the world around them, in a form that those pitiful humans were continuously trying, and failing, to understand. If I remember correctly, the little idiots called it ""meditashon"" or something like that, but I digress.

Anyway, after a couple of years of unopposed free reign on Earth, as I slowly, painstakingly geared up for my transfer to the next unsuspecting sentient-life harboring ""homeworld"" out there in the universe, I found myself wondering: *What the hell am I supposed to do now?* A tough question, that. 

I spent some time truly studying the lives of a common snail. I unlocked the serenity, the forced calm and quiet, of their existence. I changed, as a being, while figuring out those fantastic little creatures. At least, I thought I had. Being an all-powerful dark lord, I had learned to always double check, and in this case, I thought I had a good method.

It took longer than I thought it would, to give snails sentience. I mean, when you hold the kind of raw power that I do, you expect this kind of thing to take 2, 3 minutes tops. It actually took me at least 6.

Anyway, I fould myself sitting, mind balanced upon the bridge of serenity that I had learned from the beings who now sat, sentient, in front of me.

I quickly devised a method of communication with the slimy guys, and gave it a try.

""Hello, oh most serene being. I ask one question of you, calm one. Please describe to me how you view your own existence.""

The judges shifted uncomfortably in their seats as the candidate pulled out a comically over-sized hip flask, took a sip, then, after a moment, held up a finger and drained it.  

When he came up for air, he didn't belch,  He wiped his mouth, twisted the cap back on, and shoved it into the back of his pants.  

After a moment, the candidate walked over to his laptop.  He mashed a button, the screen flickered to life, and a slide appeared on the projected screen.  ""Here.  This is my pitch.  This isn't the Next Big Thing.  It's another fucking mayfly series that gets maybe six episodes on the air and eight made and will be entirely forgotten in five years other than two dozen obscuriphiles.  Because that's what you're asking for.""  

Scowling, he waved a green laser pointer around the screen.  ""I've followed the standard formula here for the typical Sit-Com Suburban Family.""  His voice was monotone in places, sing-song in others.  ""The mother is moderately attractive and smart.  The father is physically average and mentally deficient.  The older child, the Son, is a jock with a secret nerdy side.  You're meant to dislike him at first, but eventually discover hidden depths to his personality and eventually come to like him.  

""The younger child, the Daughter, is a social pariah.  Note the red hair, freckles, buck teeth, and glasses.  These are standard physical traits of an Underdog character.  She's the scapegoat.  Bad things will happen to her, and so the audience will sympathize with and relate to her.  She has no personality, she is essentially a punching bag with a face painted on it.""  

A few clicks.  The slide showed two animals, a yellow Labrador and a black and white cat.  ""The family has two pets.  These animals are as intelligent as the humans.  The dog is the smartest character in the show.  He is vicious and evil.""  

For the first time, one of the judges spoke, ""But he looks so friendly.  Aren't dogs usually the good guys in a cat-dog situation?""  

The candidate blanked his screen and turned to the judge.  ""Usually.  Do you want to give your target demographic 'Usually'?  No.  The dog is the main antagonist of the show.  He's got a secret lab.  That was a pun, by the way.  And he does experiments on the family.""  

""And the cat?""  

""She's the son's cat, and she's a victim like the others.""  

""She isn't the hero?""  

""The show has no hero.""  

""But it has a villain.""  

""You said 'Make me a Rick and Morty-like cartoon.'  There is no hero in that show.""  

""But what about the kid?  Morty?""  

The candidate sighed.  ""He's a victim.  They're all victims.  The show's about a demented old man abusing his family, but he's cool so the audience forgives him, and he's smart enough to get away with it.""  

""No, the show's about a cool old guy and his grandson going on wacky space adventures.""  

The room was silent, other than the faint whirr of the air conditioner.  Finally, the candidate spoke.  ""Have ... you even *watched* Rick and Morty?""  

The three judges exchanged nervous looks.

You see, I find it ironic how they, my fellow employees, talk about Rob, our manager. It's because I have the ability to recall the past life of whoever I talk to and Rob was Hitler in a past life. This may come to you as a shock, but just wait and you'll find the irony.

I got my cup of coffee and sat at the small round table in the break room with two other co-workers with another two standing at the counter.

""Rob has been even more Nazi lately."" One of them said. I shook my head in agreement, what else could I do?

Another one added, ""He's literally Hitler."" 

I scoffed, ""Don't I know it, bumblebee?"" and took a long sip of coffee.

""Who's bumblebee?"" The first one asked. 

I looked up in a panic from my cup, ""Nobody."" I glanced at the second co-worker.

The third guy looked at his watch, ""Almost time for roll call. I hate how Rob makes us stand in those lines for so long.""

We all stood up to refill our coffee needs before roll call. With a sigh we left the break room and I mumbled, ""Literally Hitler.""",JakeFromWhatFarm,

[IP] Fallen Titan by Jinho Bae,Syncs,"“Come, Philippos!” I heard the shout of the mountaineer as the wind carried it around the bend of the mountain path. 


His mule, Philippos, was a sturdy animal bred from strong Terran stock. Few enough Terran strains left in the Fimbriae, and a true shame that the infertility of mules had persisted despite the efforts of multiple geneticists. Philippos was a marvel of stubborn tenacity. 


I could hear the mule bray in protest as I carefully picked my way around the narrowest portion of the pass. 


“Pay no mind to the fall and you will be well, traveler.”


“Easy not to mind the fall when you’re used to it,” I grumbled to myself. I’m sure the old man was just trying to reassure me, but I was far and away more comfortable on a speedy ship than a precarious path.


I’d been dumped on this planet when the slip-space freighter that had unknowingly ferried me about its last three stops set down for repairs. I wasn’t at my best, partly out of over confidence and partly out of delving too deep into a case of smuggled Lyncisan wine from the dusty planet Al-Mabsutah. It was a hard vintage to obtain, even among the Fimbriaen colonies. The Lyncisan colonists had always differed so greatly from the neighboring colonies, and were in fact openly hostile toward them, that obtaining trade rights was a rare and excessively lucrative occurrence. My Lyncisan induced stupor had cost me a good ride out of the Fimbriaen colonies.


*And it might cost me my life,* I thought as fierce gust tore across me. I gripped the mountainside to steady myself, then glanced up to where the mountaineer would be standing.


“I’ve paid quite a bit of mind to the fall since-“ I stopped as my focus flitted past the old man, his cloak limp against his body as the end of the breeze left him by. 


My vision was fixated beyond him on an impossible mass jutting out from the neighboring mountain’s side.


“I said pay no mind to the fallen, traveler,” The old man said in such a gentle tone that it seemed he was right beside me and not ten feet away on a jagged mountain path. “His bones aren’t yet dust, but they and their taint will be gone in due time.”


“Gods, what *is* that?” I asked as I slowly approached the man and Philippos. 


“Not Gods,” The old man shook his head, “Titans. We’re an old battlefield where the fallen lay as they were. In time the disgraced will return to Tartarus, but we must hope they do not again clash on what is now ours.”


It couldn’t possibly be true, but the old man had promised to lead me to the Oracle. Ever since we had reached out into the stars, we had found more and more evidence that there was life beyond Terra. 


Alongside that evidence were clues, though often cryptic, of the ancient Gods. Their worship had waxed and waned throughout the centuries, though it had never ceased, and the first colonists of Mars had found that its namesake may well have been a reality. 


Standing on this alien mountain I felt a chill far deeper than the cold which crept in; it stemmed from inside a primordial place, an ancient and long buried instinct that mankind had forsaken as obsolete. 


“What do your people call this place?” 


The old man looked at me with a queer perplexity. 


“This mountain range, friend,” I made a slow waving gesture, “What mountains are these known as to the Kaonians?” 


“Ah,” He nodded his head, patting Philippos on the rump, “These are the Katarevousan Mountains, traveler. You stand on the precipice of Defteros.”


“And the Oracle?” My heart raced in an effort to counter the creeping chill from within, pumping blood that only seemed to fill my veins with ice.


“The Peleusia.” 


*Dis.* 


“Not Pythia, then.” Disappointment settled into the pit of my wringing stomach.


“No, young falcon, but the Peleusia will set you on the right path.” Philippos brayed and eyed the giant skeleton with suspicion. 


“My father used to call me that,” I said as I imitated Philippos, though my suspicion was directed at his owner.


“That is fitting,” His bright teeth snuck out from behind dark, chapped lips as he reached for my shoulder, “For you truly will find a way to soar soon enough. She told me to wait for you. To wait for the young falcon that smelled of home.”


*Smelled of home…*


“You’re a Lyncisan?”


He nodded again and gave my shoulder a gentle squeeze.


“We prefer al-Washq,"" He smiled again, ""And I prefer to be called Caracal.”


Philippos brayed again and began to trod along the mountain path, indifferent to our conversation and the unsettling bones. Caracal started after him, just a few steps behind.


“Come now, young falcon. The Peleusia has awaited you long enough.”",the_divine_broochs,

But when the ""protagonist"" dies, you realize you may not have thought this completely through.",Syncs,"""So, this is how I die."" was the only though that my panicked brain would allow to form. 
The large, black lizard creature slowly raised it's claws into the air over me, and every muscle in my body was screaming at me to MOVE, to GET OUT OF THE WAY. But my brain was locked with fear. After all, Jack Stallion, the Golden Knight, and protagonist of this story, had had his top half melted by the creature's acid breath just moments before, so even if I were to keep fighting, what chance would I, a lesser knight, have? 

The claws began their descent towards me, and I closed my eyes and tensed up in fear. I felt the horrible scaly claws sweep up from beneath me, and the wind whistled past as I flew the air to land what felt like several feet away, the scales still clutching beneath my legs and back. Wait... beneath me? The lizard had been above me... 
""Why does my conscience make me do things like that... Are you okay?"" A scratchy male voice that sounded nothing like that of an angel spoke to me. My brain began to realize that I wasn't dead, and I slowly opened my eyes to find myself being layed on the ground by the arms of Thorn Valesse, an Assassin for hire that I had met several days prior at a tavern. At the time, I had just recently heard from a soothsayer that this world was merely a fantasy, and I had figured that I'd need to find a knight in shining armor, who tend to be protagonists, to buddy up to, so that I might end up surviving the tale myself. Next to the Golden Knight, Jack Stallion, Thorn had seemed like just another greedy mercenary, but then, laying in that cave, watching him throw rocks at the other side of the cavern to distract the monster from our position, I realized that Thorn might be my hero after all... Perhaps this was a story of rogues rather than knights. 

""Come on, girly, don't just stare at me. I can't keep the thing distracted forever. Are you okay?"" His words snapped me out of my reverie, and I performed a quick check of my body, finding no injury beyond a dull ache in my back from when the lizard had knocked me back against the wall before. ""I seem to be fine. Thanks for pulling me out of there. And my name is not 'girly'. It's Natalie. You're Thorn. I remember you from the tavern."" He nodded, and gave me a motion to wait. 
I watched him slide down back into the main chamber of the cave, sliding through the shadows like he was one, to the place I had dropped my shield and mace. He inspected them for a moment, then flashed five fingers at me. I nodded, figuring him to mean I should run for them in five seconds. He whistled sharply, and the lizard, which had been inspecting the last place Thorn had chucked a rock, spun towards him. He dashed into a side tunnel, luring the lizard away from my weapons, and the creature obediently followed. 
I slid down the wall, retrieved my armaments, and was about to run after them when Thorn came running back out of that tunnel. In his hand was a gold and silver shortsword. Thinking back I realized then that the prophecy of a golden warrior actually only specified that the warrior's weapon was golden, not the warrior himself. 
Thorn spun to stand parallel with me, saying ""I managed to ambush it and cut it's throat. It shouldn't be able to spit any more acid at us."" I nodded to him and we briefly discussed where we should hit it and when. When the creature next came thrashing out of the tunnel at us, we met it with weapons raised.

First time posting here. I usually don't do too well with prompts, but I thought I'd give this one a go. I enjoy writing down short fiction stuff every now and again, so constructive criticism is welcome!",BurningShadow15,
"[WP] After realizing you are in a work of fiction, you immediately rush to the person you think is the protagonist in an attempt to get plot armor as their best friend. But when the ""protagonist"" dies, you realize you may not have thought this completely through.",Syncs,"*Oh, shit. What the fuck do I do now?*

That thought passed through Brook's head at least a dozen times since she saw her new best friend decapitated before her very eyes. Now, Brook hid herself in a closet- facing away from the door, of course- wondering just what she would do now. 

""That fucking fortune teller *told* me I was in a novel,"" Brook muttered to herself, clenching her fist and gritting her teeth. ""She said Karina was the protagonist! So why the hell is she-""

Brook's ranting mutterings were brought to a halt as she heard a door open nearby. Karina's killer was likely searching just about everywhere in the house, and this was his next stop. She willed herself to stop breathing, in some effort to either kill herself relatively painlessly, or avoid detection.

She wasn't really sure which would be preferable anymore. 

Two hours before, she witnessed her new friend get her head removed. A short while after that, one of their mutual friends was killed. Then another, and another... In short order, Brook was the last one- or so she assumed, that is, as she had no idea what happened to Billy. He was probably dead. 

Heavyset footsteps made their way closer to Brook's closeted bastion, and she forced herself to breathe somehow even more still. The fortune teller told her that she was in a novel, and she so desperately wanted to believe that. Perhaps there was a mistake- that thought crossed the woman's mind as the footsteps stopped. Perhaps, she was the protagonist... And she would devise some sort of plan to stop the murderer and save the day! 

The closet door opened, and Brook carefully looked over her shoulder. The killer stood, brandishing a bladed weapon of some sort, staring down at her menacingly.

It was in that moment that Brook realized that she was a character in a cheesy *horror* novel, and that the fortune teller had not told her what genre she was trapped in.

Fun prompt. First one in a while that's gotten me writing. In case anyone's interested, I've got a [sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/Probroscis/) where I post stuff up ~~semi~~irregularly.",Probroscis,
"[WP] After realizing you are in a work of fiction, you immediately rush to the person you think is the protagonist in an attempt to get plot armor as their best friend. But when the ""protagonist"" dies, you realize you may not have thought this completely through.",Syncs,"When did i first realize my world was fictional? Great question, me. It all started coming together in high school, second year first semester, when Zethaniel Dawson enrolled in our humble academy. With a name like that, I should have known something was up.

But that was only the first straw. See, Zeth was a transfer student from Transylcrania or some shit, and had joined class smack dab in the middle of the semester. And who does he get seated next to? Elliandraste Mother fucking Smith. Privileged, pretentious and impossibly unpopular despite her being insanely pretty.

Shoulda seen it coming from a mile off. But it mattered little to me, so I payed it no mind. That is, until the incident.

It had been a few weeks since Zeth enrolled, and nothing of note had happened up until that point. A few awkward glances in the cafeteria between them maybe, but smooth sailing for the most part. But today was starting of windy as Ellie was being pushed around by some asshole bullies which, again, was weird because she was *hella* good looking. 

Classic damsel moment right? And so , right on queue, the white knight arrives on the scene! Sporting a box cutter, which he promptly jams into the stomach of one of the assailants. Very heroic indeed. The hallway erupted in panic as people hurried to call 911 or fetch the school nurse. I suppose it was only fair that nobody tried to stop the foreign kid with a knife and anger management issues, myself included.

After all, I was too busy trying to process the bizarre scene that followed the brutal stabbing. Because instead of recoiling at the sight of someone actually getting fucking stabbed, Ellie just stood there like a lost lamb until he finally came over and asked her if she was alright. Now, i don't know about you guys, but when a fucking psychopath approaches me after his pray's been dispatched, i run like there's no tomorrow. 

But instead she looked up at him, eyes sparkling with adoration for her saviour, and managed a meekly ""thank you"" in response. That's when the coin fucking dropped for me. My life was a fucking YA novel.

Outside of a mild existential crisis, it didn't make much of a difference in my life at first. After all that kid had died, and Zeth was probably going to jail, so the story had no leg left to stand on. Cut to two weeks later, and Zeth is back in school. No explanation from the principal and no protests from the students. It all felt like a bad dream.

But it got worse. There was something missing for this YA novel to come to fruition, a dark supernatural backstory surrounding our fixer-upper love interest. I mean, he was even from rucrainia, that's basically where monsters are born. Monsters, however, were not good for my general life expectancy and i was seriously considering moving to australia until it had blown over.

But i then, a flash of brilliance. I could be the ethnic best friend!

A classic YA trope, the ethnic best friend role would allow me to observe everything first hand while also enjoying my plot armor. It was a flawless strategy.

I was even 1/4th Chinese, so the ethnicity wouldn't be much of a problem, I just had to start eating with chopsticks or some shit like that. Maybe even carry fortune cookies around and get better at math. I was even game for a love triangle, should it come to that, as i was sure to be ""rejected"" anyway. And since the position was up for grabs, and I was not gonna snooze on such a golden opportunity.

I had spent probably a month or two with Zeth and Ellie, travelling around the world in search of mysterious artifacts in decrepit old tombs while trying our hardest to keep up our grades. I would read from the ""Book of Evil"", spouting enough exposition for Zeth to dispatch the monsters we faced, while Ellie ran headfirst into danger allowing for her eventual rescue. Then, we would sit at lunch  discussing all things supernatural, while Zeth and Ellie made awkward sexy eyes at each other. All very basic, run of the mill sort of shit. 

But at least I learned a lot about the fictional world I inhabited in the meanwhile. For instance, Zeth was a being called a ""Ratielzk"", a borderline apex predator in the monster community. Of course, Zeth used his powers for ""good"", whereas most Ratielzk were content just chasing monsters and not poon. 

The big bad evil I assumed would serve as our villain was what the book described as ""The Bringer of Destruction"", seemingly the monster equivalent of a natural distaster. And lo and behold, one day Zeth confirmed this suspicion to us, and we were to use our newfound experience to ""save the world"" as it were. Time was short, but of course they had to spend one last night together ""preparing"" before we could make our move.

Queue D-day. I had been up all night perusing the book for spells and artifacts that could prove useful to me and at last felt as prepared as could be. It was an intoxicating sensation, and one very much familiar to me. Of course, Ellie was wearing a dress and sandals, hellbent on making this as difficult for us as possible. To be fair, she didn't require anything else. Zeth would save her and the world anyway, as he always did, so why fix what wasn't broken.

A part of me wondered how my life in Australia would be right now, but then again a more incompetent version of myself could have meant a complete monster uprising. Or at least that's what I told myself, clutching the book tighter and fighting back a grin before stepping through the portal.

The ""big bad"" turned out to really live up to his name, at least a hundred feet of flaming red muscles. Zeth started his rage fueled speech as expected of course, ""you killed my family"" and so forth, almost boiling over before Ellie stopped him. Now, where these pacifist beliefs were when we were slaughtering ZomPires by the dozen I'll never know, but they were here now and non negotiable. 

Seemingly doing an impression of Lois Lane with the suicidal drive of a lemming, she actually approached the nightmarish terror trying to appeal to it's humanity or some shit. Zeth and I could only stand by and watch in horror as the massive being literally tore her to pieces. The shock was paralyzing, but as deep dark blood stained my face I managed to push us both back through the portal before closing it as quickly as possible. 

We must have spent hours in that room, just laying on the floor in shock. My mind was panicked and confused, a terrible combination as more fatalistic notions often surfaced. I was just starting to accept the fact that she was dead when he spoke. 

""I can't believe that didn't work."" he said in that weird Slavic accent of his. ""She was supposed to be the one.""

""My thoughts exactly bud."" I answered, grateful for something to ground myself with.

My plot armor was gone, or maybe never there in the first place, and it was a frightening feeling. Even more frightening was how outmatched I felt before that *thing*. I turned my head to look at the magical human-looking being laying beside me, imagining the droves of supernatural findings yet to be discovered. No way this was the end. A nice juicy chunk of plot armor just ripe for the taking.

""So..."" I start with the sexiest voice i can muster ""guess we're both single now huh?""

It really shouldn't be this way. Clarence was the *Chosen One.* This was...this was universally fucking accepted, okay? He fit the goddamn prophecy to a TEE. Born on a moonless night. Sandwiched between two separate trios of triplets. His father **had no heart** (*Born of a man with no heart*...he's got an artificial heart, for fuck's sake!

Who's the one who's been thumbing his nose at evil and telling off supporters of the Lord of Quiet because he was so goddamn sure that his best friend the *goddamn fucking HERO* was going to triumph in the end?

You know, I could have chosen evil all those years ago. The evil kids always threw the best parties all through school. And the evil girls were notoriously easy. But no. I had to go on *goddamn fucking ADVENTURES* with that nearsighted asshat. Fight giant bats. Defeat ancient stone monsters. I was cursed by a witch for an entire semester once, did you know that? I shit myself every time I used a vowel. 

But it was fine. The benefits outweighed the sacrifices, because my best friend was the hero. The Chosen One.

Shit.

Well, fuck it. I'm just gonna tell everyone I was a double agent the whole time. That works sometimes, right?

*Right???*",WinsomeJesse,

"[WP] After realizing you are in a work of fiction, you immediately rush to the person you think is the protagonist in an attempt to get plot armor as their best friend. But when the ""protagonist"" dies, you realize you may not have thought this completely through.",Syncs,"""Oh shit! Oh shit! Oh shit!"" It's all I could say as I stood over Derrick's body laying in the street. He was the protagonist - he couldn't be dead. Tall, good looking, square-jawed, charming, ladies-man Derrick couldn't be dead. My brain had gone into some kind of loop. I was supposed to be either the comedy relief or plucky sidekick (I'd been working on my wisecracks, but to be honest most of the just didn't land). 

We had been swept up in some sort of grand quest. Derrick lead us from our small tow to fight the bad guy. That's what we started calling him - ""Bad Guy"". I think his real name was Robert. Anyway, when we started calling him that, I realized we were following a very old script. Derrick didn't want to go at first (""Hero denies the call"", right?), then he met an old man who everyone thought was crazy and lived at the edge of town. Nobody understood why I called that crazy bastard Obi-wan. He convinced Derrick to heed the call. 

Derrick then gathered us up - the jester, the rogue, the thief, and the bard. Tara was the thief - she got busted for shoplifting from Walmart a couple of months ago. Gary was the rogue - he had gone off to college, dropped out, and came back to start up a wed design company that hadn't flamed out yet but which we all thought was probably a money laundering operation. Roger was the bard - he still lived with his parents and played in a band that he was sure was going to make it big. That left me as the jester. Or maybe I was something else. I don't think I was a barbarian or any of the magical creatures. I certainly wasn't a paladin, monk, or ranger. I would have liked to think I was a wizard, but I had to be honest and admit I wasn't smart enough for that. 

Bad Guy, or Robert or whatever, was buying up the aluminum plant in town and was planning on shutting it down. If that plant shut down, the town would die. Over half the population of the county worked at that plant. Everyone we knew either worked there or had a family member that did. The five of us in our little group were never getting out of this town. If that bastard closed down the plant, we'd end up cooking meth behind Denny's. 

It turned out that Bad Guy played rough though. We started by appealing to his humanity, which was in short supply. We got a spot on the news in the city. Bad Guy made a statement that while he understood our concern, he was trying to protect the jobs of tens of thousands of other people at the parent company. Finally, we resorted to spying. None of us were exactly strangers to the wrong side of the law but this was a little more serious than we were used to.

We broke into his house one evening when he was away at some fancy dinner party. We thought we could find something in there that we could use to blackmail him. Maybe he had some embarrassing porn on his computer or maybe he had a girl chained up in the basement. 

What we didn't know is that Bad Guy had an alarm on his house. The alarm didn't go to the police though. The local cops weren't too friendly with him after they found out he was closing the plant. So he had his alarm sent to a private security force. They showed up without us noticing. They didn't have any lights on and they slipped in quietly through the front door. They spotted us and we ran. 

The guards were a little too anxious to prove how good they were at protection and started shooting at us. It was dark and nobody could tell what was going on. Derrick was to my right as we cleared the yard. I heard him scream and turned in time to see him spin around and hit the pavement. The bullet had torn a hole through the left side of his chest the size of a dinner plate. 

The guards caught up to Derrick and me in no time. The others got away. The police came. I spent the night in jail. The next morning my parents showed up with a lawyer. He told me about ""felony murder"". It seems that if you commit a crime and someone dies while you're doing that, they can charge you with that person's murder. If say, your best friend got shot while you were breaking and entering, they could put his murder on you. Even though those rat bastard guards are the ones who shot him in the back. The lawyer told me I should take the plea deal so that I could be out in ten years. I told him to stuff it - no way were they laying Derrick's murder on me.

I sat through my trial like it was a waking dream. I never told anyone about Tara, Gary, or Roger being there that night. No sense in dragging them down with me. The judge won't let us talk about Bad Guy trying to shut down the plant. In fact, he says if I bring it up, he'll hold me in contempt and move the trial so far away no one I know will be able to come support me. I keep my mouth shut the whole time so he can't hold anything against me.

The jury acquitted. I learned that word the morning they came back and said ""not guilty"". I went home for the first time in eight months as my nightmare ended. 

When this all started out, I thought Derrick was the protagonist. I thought there was no way he could be harmed because he was the main character - the true hero come to vanquish the evil in our midst. I now realize I was mistaken about that. He was my backstory. I'm the tragic anti-hero who now must avenge my fallen comrade. My plot armor kept me from being shot that night and it kept me out of prison. I am invulnerable until my story ends. Maybe it'll end with a noble sacrifice, maybe it'll end with the good guys triumphant, maybe it'll end with me defeating the Bad Guy only to have him replaced by an even more terrible foe. Doesn't matter. I carry the plot forward on my shoulders and it protects me from harm. We have a beautiful relationship - right up until the plot no longer needs me.",AltCipher,

But when the ""protagonist"" dies, you realize you may not have thought this completely through.",Syncs,"Okay, no, think, I’m supposed to be the smart one. I’ve got all the gadgets, the computer knowledge, I mean, shit, I even have glasses! They don’t have lenses, but they’re there! Okay, breathe. Both of Claire’s legs have been blown off below the knee by a mine, but she’s still sort of alive. Wait. Is she? “Tomas, is she still breathing?!” A recon mission! It was supposed to be for exposition! We were supposed to learn more about the secretive dystopian government, not get blown up by mines before making it anywhere near their goddamn high-security compound!

The third part of Claire’s love triangle was crouched next to her, tears welling up in his eyes. The second part of her love triangle was back at the base, cooking or something. “Y-yes, she is, but she’s unconscious. She w-won’t stay breathing for long i-if we don’t do anything.” He sobbed, before gritting his teeth.  He whipped his head around, focusing an intense, tear-filled and determined gaze on me. “Do something, Deck!”

I didn’t pick the nickname, first of all, Claire did as a part of an inside joke that stuck. “W-we can patch up her legs! The rebellion has to have prosthetics! First, we need to stop the bleeding! We, uh, just need to, uh, cauterize it? No, bandages! Get the bandages!” We should have brought more people! Three fucking teenagers?! If we had some nameless rebels, maybe one of them would’ve stepped on the mine instead! 

Tomas slung his backpack from his shoulder, fumbling the zipper in his rush to get the bandages out. I immediately took my jacket off, to try to soak up the blood and clean the wounds from her legs. My hands quickly got covered in blood. Fuck! Everything was perfect! Right down to the fucking character development! Suddenly, a shaky, pale hand was placed over mine. I looked up to see Claire’s eyes fluttering open. Holy fuck. “Deck?” Her voice barely went above a whisper. Her eyelids could barely lift themselves.

Shitshitshitshitshit. “Shit, shit, shit. I’m right here, Claire, don’t talk, we’re gonna get you fixed up real quick, okay?” I smiled as I saw the life slowly draining from her once lively eyes. “Me and Tomas are gonna get you patched up, then we’re gonna carry you back to the rebel base, and then we’re gonna get you some badass robot legs, got it?” Of course she isn’t gonna die here! She’s the main fucking character! Robot legs! This author is amazing!

Tomas nodded, He attempted a smile as well, but it was weak. He saw what I saw. “Y-yeah, Claire. We’ll get you back to everybody safe and sound, okay?” He barely managed to choke the words out.

She smiled at us. Fuck. “Y-you guys…” She whispered, “I’m sorry…”

I choked. “N-no, stop.” When did I start crying? Tomas dropped his head, sobbing weakly.

“D-Deck… I’m dying…” Tears welled up in her eyes and rolled down her cheeks. “I’m dying…” Her voice quavered, as if even speaking was an effort. The smile disappeared. She had fought so much, struggled through so much, and now she could barely speak. She was larger than life, before. An unstoppable source of hope. Grinning in the face of death. A winner against impossible odds, if even by the very skin of her teeth. That’s how I knew she was the main character. But now? Now she’s just a sixteen year old girl, bleeding her life out of the stumps that were her legs.

I blinked the tears from my face and took her hand in both of mine. “We’re right here, Claire.” I whispered. If I spoke any louder, I wouldn’t be able to get the words out. “Everybody’s right here. We’re back in the base. We’re all in the kitchen and Xavier is baking that cake you love so much and your mom is helping out. Captain Anders, his lieutenants and Tomas are going over battle plans. Me and your baby sister are talking about computers. And you’re doing that thing you do when you get worried, where you distance yourself from us all. But the cake comes out of the oven and you can smell it.” I keep describing the scene to her. Everybody is there and we urge her to sit down for just a moment with us. Her lips barely manage a smile. I continue talking, even while her eyes slowly close themselves. We laugh around the table. The cake is half-eaten and we’re just talking, now. Not about the rebellion. Not about the government. I'm not even in a story anymore. I'm here, in the kitchen, eating the cake, talking to Claire the sixteen year old girl, not Claire the main character. I keep talking until her smile disappears.

But when the ""protagonist"" dies, you realize you may not have thought this completely through.",Syncs,"Okay, so maybe I hung with the wrong dude. How did my best friend just get fucking merked by some loser who literally thought he was some chosen samurai-demigod?

Ok so get this. I roll into class (med-school at STANFORD, okay? Get at me) and this dude invites me to sit with him and some of his friends. They're all attractive human beings, and the major cluster of people in the room. Clearly they're the popular people. Dude introduces himself as Gialon Atherton, and his friend next to him blurts out that Gialon is supposedly THE dude. He's gonna be the one that does the thing or some shit like that. I wasn't paying much attention because Gialon was talking over him to me. Seems like a cool guy, and if I become friends with a group like this, I firmly believe my time in college would be incredible.

So we all hang out a bunch, and sometimes just Gialon and I will go do something like just hang at the CVS in the Village shopping center just outside the entrance on, like, the opposite end of campus at 3am. It's surprisingly fun. The Author has blessed me with classes in the afternoon only, which is AWESOME.

Time passes, graduation happens, and he, I, and all his friends decide to start a company to just research cures for diseases and shit. Goes well, we decide to start focusing on doing cool shit with genetics. We try and figure out how to put really cool features onto different animals, like a deer with a chameleon's camouflage, or a lion with a rhino's horn. Stuff like that.

Then the media starts screwing us. Saying we're immoral. So we try to advance evolution in humans to make humans more resistant to things like ultra-violet light damage in an effort to curve skin cancer rates. Then this random dude just rolls into our office acting like some dude from the dark ages and fucking challenges Gialon to a fight by, get this, saying something like ""YOUR TIME OF PLAYING GOD IS NOW OVER. YOU MUST STOP THIS OPERATION IMMEDIATELY. IF YOU DO NOT, I AM FORCED TO CHALLENGE YOU TO A DUEL."" A duel? Who the fuck calls it a duel anymore? Whatever. Dude looks like a bum who's been sitting on the side of the road the past month, and Gialon lifts every day. We tell him to fuck off, but the next day we get a report that some of the guards in the west wing aren't reporting.

I decide to go over and check, and when I get there, the guards are knocked out on the floor. Oh, did I not mention our facility turned into something like the Pym (I don't really follow nerd movies) facility from Ant-Man? Anyway, I don't find the guy. Must be crawling through the vents or some shit.

I go back to the main researching area, only to find the glass doors locked, and the dude is there facing Gialon. Dude says his name is David, and he's here to topple Gialon, who he believes is a disgrace any God, whether they exist or not, and that he's here to ""topple the giant"". What a self-righteous nerd. Then he pulls out a fucking katana and swings it around trying to be all cool like the ""wanna see my moves?"" guy on the Internet from like, the early 2000 or some shit. Then Gialon does the weirdest shit. He extends his arms like wolverine, and out come fucking claws. What the fuck, Gialon? No protagonist does that shit to himself. 

So they end up fighting, and I'm sure Gialon can kill the loser-neckbeard, all while trying to open the door and pondering the situation at hand. Then I figure it out and lose all hope. Move some letters around with Gialon Atherton and you get Goliath with a leftover n a e r t o n. I don't really care what those can spell out, but if I remember correctly from my parents, David kills the giant Goliath. FUCK.

Looks like I'm the bad guy's sidekick. At least I have at least tree-fiddy million dollars in my bank account. I'll just leave like Starscream in one of the Transformers movies.

So basically this is how it went. I woke up yesterday and found out that I was living in some fiction book sorta ting. Wanna know how I found out? Cause I am a genius.

So we chat and he become my best friend, you know how it goes. Anyway he died cause I accidentally tripped and head butted him in the dick which caused internal dick bleeding and he died. I dunno if this is what the writer wanted but it was awkward as fuck.

Then after he died this villain guy came up to me and laughed after he heard the story how I killed the hero. But his laugh was so annoying I couldn't take it anymore so I just straight up bitch slapped his ass.

The body, so medical so sterile, like Carol had not been the only person I have lived for in these last 3 years. Blood mixing in with her hair, crusting over and turning the red to a dull brown. Blood looks so dark in large quantities. 

I can see the sun setting now, and the rock path that we, no I, am kneeling on. The rocks that fell and took away the only hope I had. What kind of protagonist dies in a rock-slide? There was no glory, no battle, no final stand between us and them. Just some fucking earth taking out my hope. 

Fire in the sky, snakes as big as elephants, I knew what kind of George RR Martin shit was happening. Brunette and boring Beatrice was never going to survive the onslaught and every fiber in my body begged me to leave my house, all of my high scores on Tetris did not help me, and there she was, Carol. She was at the town hall, leading and organizing. Her red hair moving like the flames in the sky I thought it was so clear. She must have been the main character. 

But here we are, when everyone else left I thought I would be rewarded for my loyalty. For being the last believer. Now I am alone.

But when the ""protagonist"" dies, you realize you may not have thought this completely through.",Syncs,"The complete cast of characters arranged themselves in my mind like a police lineup. One by one, they fell to the wayside, ruled out by height, weight, and skin tone, until only five remained. Johnny Armstrong and Allen Wingspan were trespassers in a land of Farmer Browns and Trader Joes. Their biceps rippled under too-tight t-shirts, and their chests glistened through conveniently unstitched tears, but their hands betrayed them, manicured and callous-free. They were cardboard cutouts of musclemen, with pretty faces stuck through the holes. The heaviest things they'd ever lifted were the guitars that survived the apocalypse. As all the girls in our group swooned over their campfire ballads, I safely concluded they were merely the story's romantic interests.

The remaining three were girls involved in some sort of hate triangle. Patrice Everclear and Winona Skyline constantly butted heads: every issue was ripe for debate, down to which way the map was held. It played out the same way each time: the two would begin arguing, the entire group would pause, and after enough exposition was shouted, Alice Smith would emerge with the perfect compromise, allowing us to press on. 

At first, I believed Alice to be the protagonist, but her character remained bland and uninspired while Patrice's and Winona's continued to develop. The two conspired against each other, factionalized the entire group, and hooked up with each of the blatant teen heartthrob inserts. All the while, Alice continued to fulfill her role as the story's conflict resolution device. As the tensions escalated, and Alice began to struggle, I wondered if the author would kill her off to teach the other girls a lesson. She seemed so removed from the story; it was as if she didn't belong here at all.

As for which of Patrice and Winona was the protagonist...I couldn't tell. Both were impulsive, crafty, and beautiful—but not so beautiful as to promote unrealistic aesthetic standards. Patrice tended towards the positive: she spun visions of a glorious revolution and the promised land thereafter. She spoke of green meadows, warm beds, and brick houses with perpetually smoking chimneys. Winona would stand up and assail her ideals with questions: how and when and at what cost. Then she would deface Patrice's canvas with her own paint, with the cool and somber shades of reality, pointing out each impossibility and impracticality. Allen and Johnny and the rest of the camp would swing their heads back and forth between the two as they argued, until eventually, Alice would stand up and suggest everyone go to sleep and continue in the morning.

The last of these arguments was over the two romantic interests. In a twist even I hadn't foreseen, Patrice had found both Johnny and Allen in Winona's tent. It was a scene that I'd believed too risque for the standard young adult novel, and I began to wonder if I'd wrongly assumed the genre. 

Patrice now confronted Winona with her sword, challenging her to a duel. Winona accepted, drawing her own weapon. The crowd turned expectantly to Alice, but she only shrugged and shook her head. The two began to fight. Their swords searched for each other and found their opposites with ease. It was a contrivance of a fight scene that made me wish the author had chosen a gunfight instead. They danced, but like marionettes rather than humans. 

After several minutes of neither landing a blow, both Patrice and Winona simultaneously speared each other with their respective blades. The two fell away from each other, hilts pointed toward the sky. Both were conveniently dead on impact.

""Well, that's that,"" Alice said, and all the gathered people turned instinctively towards her as she assumed the mantle of leadership without so much as a word of question. Allen and Johnny each wrapped a beefy arm around her. The birds chirped in approval, and the clouds shifted so that the sun pierced through the blue and shone upon Alice. 

Alice smiled serenely and looked over the camp. As I stared into her eyes, I could almost see the author herself gazing back.",hideouts,

Sunny nervously looked over the dead body while Klaus tried to calm down Violet, even though he was about as scared as she was. The three siblings had found a book the other day, telling the truth. They were just characters in a story. Perhaps somebody was going to help them clear their name? So, they found this man called 'Lemony Snicket', and they had tried to talk to him about the plot. Of course, he said nothing. Then somebody tried to attack Violet. Of course, the attacker suffered a heart attack as Violet tried to shoot the man. Instead, she shot Lemony. ""Violet, Klaus... we should run as fast as we can!"" And so, the three Baudelaire Siblings ran as fast as they could, not knowing that when they killed Lemony Snicket, they also doomed the author of their series to die the same way.

I mean, the main character's best friend ALWAYS lives, right?  But then again, so does the main character.  And I can't figure out how Lord Galatrix WASN'T the main character.  The Shadow Emperor of the entire galaxy, commander of the Legion of Woes, the only person I've ever seen riding a Toxin Dragon into battle, he had it all!  

But there he is.  

His ebony armor somehow pierced by that farm boy's Viber Blade, a puddle of Galatrix's black blood surrounding his corpse.  I just couldn't piece together how that boy had gotten so proficient with his blade that quickly.  It had taken me years of training directly under Lord Galatrix to develop my own skills.  Then, of course, the years I spent subjugating the rebel forces kept me sharp.  

The boy had mentioned something about the village he came from to my master and confidant Galatrix in their duel in the Eclipsed Castle.  Turns out some of Galatrix's top legionnaires and I had burned that down when the Whisperer gave Galatrix a name 18 years ago.  Somehow I guess we missed this boy, he must have been a baby at the time.   

He's probably going to try to kill me next.  I was pretty sure my status as Galatrix's best friend was enough to keep me alive, but I guess this story is a tragedy.  I ready my Viber Blade, pressing the button to start the whirring of the serrated edges.  The boy does the same, intense focus in his eyes and the white armor of the terrorist rebellion covering his young and muscular form.  

He swings his blade and I realize that maybe white would suit me more than black.        ",abutthole,

But when the ""protagonist"" dies, you realize you may not have thought this completely through.",Syncs,"Grant Allen was one spectacular son of a bitch.
Imagine Adonis, if Adonis was named captain of his high school football, swim and track teams as just a sophomore.
Grant's parents bought him a red Corvette for his 16th birthday. He's got a team of kids who all do his homework for him, and he's dating Lauren Park, a senior whose parents own a hot tub.
I mean, come on. With all that going for him, it's pretty frigging clear that Grant Allen is the one.
I'm talking, like, the chosen one. The Big Kahuna. The man who saves us from a scourge of phantoms and otherworldly beasts, travels back in time to save JFK from being assassinated, and makes it home in time to play a game of Madden with his best bro.
He's the protagonist.
Or, at least I thought he was.
I should explain, I'm not real, per se.
Yeah, it came as a shock to me, too, but as it turns out, I'm a character in a book.
More specifically, I'm a throw-away character in a story written by an author who can't make up his goddamned mind about anything.
I figure most books don't have this identity crisis.
It must be hard to tell where the words end and reality begins in quality fiction, but here, it ain't hard to read between the lines, so to speak.
The truth became pretty evident when the rewrites began to pile up.
They began small, almost unnoticeable. Blue eyes turned green. Cats turned into dogs. That kind of stuff. Inconsequential.
But then came the major revisions.
I was walking to the library one day with my girlfriend, Jennifer, when I stopped in my tracks, befuddled.
Suddenly I was standing behind the counter of an empty coffee shop. And I was black. And a girl.
Before I could even begin to ask where the fuck I was - or who the fuck I was - I was transported to a cruise ship, where I was a 40-something Zumba instructor for pill-popping seniors with unnaturally high libidos.
After that I was a farmer who reeked of pig shit all the live-long day. Then an astronaut who's capsule erupted into a meteoric shower of fiery death 17 seconds after takeoff. A dirty cop, a little girl with pig tails, a member of a Mexican drug cartel.
And let me tell you, once that veil is lifted, there's no unseeing your world ripped apart at the seams.
But then, one day, I woke up as my pudgy, pasty high school self, like nothing had ever happened.
I'd never been so happy to see my face riddled with acne.
Eventually, I went back to school, but everything and everyone was different. Changed. Warped into something crude and unfamiliar. Except for him.
Grant Allen, that miraculous mother fucker, he hadn't changed a bit. 
That's when I realized it, that he was the one. He had to be. And if I wanted to stay me, I knew I had to become his number two.
I told him I wanted to be in his posse and he immediately embraced me as a brother.
Actually, if I'm being honest, I think the term he used was ""stooge.""
Turns out, Grant was kind of a dick, but hey, I didn't mind as long as I didn't wake up as an ""exotic dancer"" doing hand stuff in the back room of Dirty Dan's Boobie Bungalow.
Not again.
So every week I shook down some kids for their lunch money, stole their homework. The usual, all at Grant's behest. And things were good for a few months.
Until the cyborgs came.
Fucking androids out of fucking no where.
Not a hint of foreshadowing. No groundwork laid, no plot justification.
They just descended from the sky, firing away with photon lasers, incinerating everyone in their path.
Including Grant, that son of a bitch.
Brimming with equal parts piss, vinegar and youthful idiocy, he tried to run one over with his car while screaming ""Tokyo drift!"" at the top of his lungs.
I watched helplessly as the only tether to my identity was reduced to cinders, and I wept bitter tears as the cyborgs turned their lasers on me.
""Please, just make it quick,"" I begged them, closing my eyes tightly.
But their ray guns never fired.
Instead, I could feel myself drift off to a new identity as the author retconned his latest plot, unmaking me, the alien invasion, even Grant.
After what felt like an eternity, I mustered the courage to open my eyes only to be met by a fate far more cruel than death by cyborg.
In front of me glowed a pink neon sign, welcoming me to Dirty Dan's Boobie Bungalow.
I screamed.",DMike31,

	“Hey kid, pretty chilly huh?” The store clerk sputtered through bloody teeth. 
	“What the fuck! Are you alright?” Replied the customer as he sauntered towards the injured store clerk. The clerk’s apron had dried blood on it, and so did the corner of the counter he commanded. 
	“Yeah I’m fine kid don’t worry, but be careful goin’ home. Didn’t know this was *that* kind of neighborhood.” He said as he pointed to his bloody garments.

“These chumps came in asking all kinds of questions, like where my girl stays and shit. Didn’t bother me until they assumed they could trash the place.” 
“But nothing is broken?”
“Because I trashed them first kid, always throw the first punch.” The clerk proudly advised.

Fuck okay they won’t find me back here.* The customer quietly considered the conundrum from the back of the store, peeking from between beige chinos. He had a clear line of sight to the back exit, but wasn’t sure if he was fast enough to outrun guns. *All I have to do, is find the badass store clerk and then we escape.* He concluded from his castle of pant legs. Just as he decided to find him, the store clerk appeared in the exit doorway. 
	“So, you punk-“Before the clerk could speak, his apron was filled with bullet holes.

George R.R Martin replied, leaning back in his chair and resting his hands calmly on his belly. It had cost me considerable money come here and it was through sheer luck that he'd granted me an audience, but when you realise nothing is real, money stops seeming so valuable.

""So you can help me figure this out?"" I asked, reaching down to take my proof off of his coffee table. It was such a simple thing, a book that described events as they were happening, starting at the point where it was revealed to me that the world was a story. You could never reach the end because there always seemed to be one more page, yet the book never grew in size.

""Well, are you sure he was the protagonist?"" George asked.

""He beat cancer while overcoming racial profiling. He lost his older brother to gangs, tracked down the dad he never knew and dealt with his mothers homophobia as she learned to love him for who he was, and to accept his boyfriend who he met during his chemo sessions. He put *The Fault in Our Stars* to shame.""

""Ah, yes but didn't one of the characters in *The Fault*-"" George began before I held up a hand to stop him.

""First off, spoilers."" I replied, pointing to the heavens, ""The readers might not have read it yet, if it even exists in their world. Secondly, it was a double murder-suicide carried out by his boyfriends mentally unstable ex. This isn't one of *your* books George, it doesn't read right.""

Bringing his hands up to his snow-white beard, George pondered in silence for a few seconds. ""Have you considered for a moment that you aren't dealing with a professional author?"" He said, finally.

""How do you mean? None of this reads or plays out like bad fan fiction."" I replied.

""Clearly."" George agreed, ""Otherwise we'd have Superman flying around fighting Goku and lynching Zack Snyder, or there'd be some sort of self-insert Mary Sue saving us all with every superpower imaginable. What I mean is... Look, you say that we aren't tertiary side characters, correct? The fact that the book focused on the life of first your friend and now you tells us that you aren't some unmentioned background character that is always assumed to exist in the fictional world. After all, I don't write about every stable boy in Westeros, do I? Or all the tragedies that befall him, his friends and his family, right?""

I thought for a moment. I wasn't terribly familiar with his books, but I nodded anyway.

""Well then, perhaps we are merely being written by an amateur. A hobby writer or someone yet to be published, imagining our world as a thought experiment in the hopes of honing their craft? Consider how inexplicable your being here is for a moment. Do you really think someone like me would agree to see you on a whim? Or was it something that needed to happen in order for the plot to proceed? Something that the writer explained poorly?""

I pondered that for a moment. It made sense, the cliches, the way it all seemed to be trying to set itself apart, trying to be different, new and even edgy in ways. I suddenly found myself wondering what would happen if an amateur writer left in a typo or a poorly worded sentence. Would I know if I had been edited?

George nodded as he saw me processing the idea. ""It may even be possible that we aren't entirely the product of the writers imagination. The characters, your friend, yourself and I might certainly be their creations, but the idea might not have even been their own!""

He looked at me knowingly.

As Fulbright and I ran down the narrow tunnel I was excited for the coming showdown. Finally Fulbright was going to destroy the Golden Lord. But he seemed nervous which made no sense to me. He fit the legendary prophecy perfectly. Born on a moonless night check. Calendar confirms it was a new moon. Born between 2 sets of triplets check cinder was cute too. Born to a man with no heart check his father had a magic blood pumper. Seirously no one else had even met 2 of them before. 

Suddenly he stopped and said, ""leo something is bothering me."" ""What is it?"" I replied ""Do you think the Golden Lord ran?""  

""No but, well there are 6 of us that came in here and only 5 major leaders"" he began ""And that's great, Goran gets to kill the mountain troll that destroyed his village, Elsine gets to settle things with her sister, and everyone else gets to have this big climactic showdown right?"" 

""Yeah I wish I could see them but I get to see the best, your fight"" I said proudly. ""And I can't wait till you vanquish the Golden Lord."" 

""Leo I think you're missing my point, what are you supposed to do?"" He asked. ""Not that I don't appreciate you being here you're a great help"" he said quickly 

""Well I think I'm just here to fight any of the minions that try to get involved"" I said unsure. ""Why do you want to guard the gate or something?""

""No I just don't want to be taken by surprise by another threat"" he said. ""Are you sure there is no one in your past that might pop up?""

""No I have kinda a boring life"" I replied. "" I was born an only child in a small village up north in a small fishing village where the sun never set during summer and never rose during winter. The most interesting thing about my birth is that the midwife was tired from having to deliver a set of triplets the night before. She had to do a set after too now that I think about it"" I began to ramble.

""What about you're father you never mention him."" Fulbright asked quickly. 

""Oh he died before I was born, crazy accident sent a pole straight through the left side of his chest."" I replied 

""Ok but nothing happend to your village at all?"" He inquired ""No monster attacks, no bandit raids, and no dragons?"" 

""Nope nothing"" I said ""like I said my life is boring, the highlight of every year was the midsummer festival because it was always close to my birthday so I always got to go at least once a day""

""OK"" Fulbright said ""I guess you're just suppose to help me out, let's go rake out the Golden Lord.""

We turned and continue to run down the tunnel towards the final showdown with the golden lord. 
He was gripping the sacred sword When fulbright turned and said ""what would happen if I were to be killed before I fought the Golden Lord?""

""The sacred sword would turn to dust just as our chances of winning."" I said poetically as he drew the sword.

""Well then I guess we are lucky that none of the Golden lord's goons are smart enough to"" all of a sudden a loud wet *shilck* hit my ears as the falling ram skull hit Fulbright's stomach. As I ran to him I scarely heard the sacred sword slide along the ground. By the time I got to him he was gone. With far to much blood on the stones, nothing but mist in his eyes and no breath to be had. I shouted a wordless cry for my friend and the world for now the Golden Lord's reign would never end. 

As my tears began to clear and I began to form a plan to save as many as possible my eyes saw a silver glow. When I looked up at its source, there I saw the sacred blade still shining.",Jdm5544,

But when the ""protagonist"" dies, you realize you may not have thought this completely through.",Syncs,"     I wake to the sound of my phone ringing and immediately reach out to turn it off. I could not be less interested in going to work today. But I can't reach the nightstand like normal. Eyes opening a little wider now I don't recognize the room I'm in. Did I get drunk last night? Where am I? 
     I see a picture in the unfamiliar room of a thinner, happier, darker version of myself with a beautiful Indian woman in a wedding dress as I hear a warm purr behind me in bed. 
     ""Hmmmm, good morning baby"" the voice says. ""I wish you weren't leaving today.""
     ""Me too"" I say. ""But you know they need me to cover the coronation."" 
     I roll over to hold her and while I've never seen her before I know her body and how she likes to be held intimately, innately. I know that she doesn't like for me to pull back the hair covering her eyes because she likes it stay as dark as possible for as long as possible in the morning. I know her name is Reena and we've been married for seven years. I know I have a name different than the one I've always known and that I work for a major news organization. I know my regular life, the one I've always known, but I also know this other new life. Words flow from my mouth without thought. 
     ""I'll make breakfast for Sanjay, come down when you're ready, love."" I say, and my heart swells at the thought of my son, whom I've never met. 
     As I walk downstairs to the kitchen before waking up little Jay I stumble with wonder. I'm not myself and I don't know any of this but I know everything. I have woken up in a different life. A life I've dreamed of but didn't think was possible. If I could write my life, this would be the kind of life I want. This morning would just be background though, there's not anything important to the plot happening here. I'm just living out this perfect little written life. 
     I'm not complaining! This life completely surpasses the shadow of a life I was living yesterday. Single and restless, unfinished; nightly going from girl to girl and bar to bar. So why am I here, now? 
     In the newly renovated kitchen I grab a banana and cutting board and begin to sweat. I feel a wave of dread come over me and the rush of adrenaline starts my hands shaking. I don't know how I know, but little Jay has been killed. 
     I walk upstairs in a daze, feeling the weight of a story that is propelling me forward, in and out of full knowledge. 
     I walk into my dead son's room, and weep at knowing he is mine but never getting to talk with him. His body, lifeless, is still in bed. His face is peaceful, I touch his cheek. I know he has been poisoned as fully as I know my wife and my new life. 
     This was supposed to be his story. Something has gone terribly wrong. So far I had spoken acted without thought, as though it had already been written. But now I walk to wake my wife, and I have no idea what to say. ",greenlightpapers,

I shook my head vigorously, only to collapse and dry wretch from the throbbing pain that drove from  skull to neck. My mouth scratched itself like sandpaper, and in swallowing I had the sensation of choking on air. I pushed myself up, drying needles from the landscape's prickly green brush scratching my hands terribly. I wasn't in Kansas anymore.

I imagined this is what amnesia felt like. That I *knew* what amnesia was suggested some sort of concrete past. With no better option, I trudged forward, keeping the ocean to my left. My legs screamed with every step, sending spasms of agony through my pelvis and into my chest. Had I not been so distracted, I would not have been caught unawares.

I heard them before I saw them. It began as a low, tinny rumbling and then graduating to a pounding crescendo as the first soldier appeared from around the ridge. Even at distance, the noonday sun reflected sharply off his bronze shield and tip of his spear, which stood taller than him. Dozens of columns followed in tow, each man marching in precise formation.

For a moment, I considered hiding. It may have been possible to tuck and cover in the surrounding shrubbery, but I was in as much danger from the elements and my own body's neglect than the tip of a spear. So I stood with my hands hanging loosely at my sides, as motionless and docile as I could bear. An eternity passed and as the thundering grew closer and the ground shook, I closed my eyes and said a silent prayer. *Who was I praying to?* The pounding ceased abruptly. I opened my eyes and found myself staring at a golden demon.

He was wearing a bronze mask that covered his face entirely, and though I could not see his eyes, I felt them boring into me. He was easily half a foot shorter than me, though his presence sent shivers down my spine. *This was a man born to lead*, I thought. We must have stood at odds for several minutes, though to this day, I remember it as the longest moment of my life.

He spoke in Greek, and I understood it. Another small piece of the puzzle, it seemed. ""Are you a citizen?"" he asked, his tone suggesting a genuine bemusement at the ragged giant in front of him. I caught my tongue, choking on it several times before murmuring a response, also in Greek. ""I am lost. I do not remember,"" I said.

The soldier's posture visible relaxed. That we spoke the same language had been enough to assuage him. ""You should go back,"" he said, pointing past the columns of men. ""We will do battle here. It is not for you."" I felt surprised at my panic. A second ago, I had been quite ready to find my own way, though now I dared not abandon the only safety in sight. ""Please,"" I replied, dropping to my knees, ""I have nowhere to go.""

He must have heard desperation in my voice, as within a moment I had been given a hunk of dark bread, a wedge of hardened cheese, and found myself marching awkwardly beside the general, his army shaking the ground behind me. Within several hours we stopped. The road had narrowed to almost an impasse, with the columns having switched to only three men a breast to fit through. ""Where are we?"" I emboldened to ask.

""This is Thermopylae,"" the general replied. ""We fight here.""",MavisMudslide,

Right I'm sure you readers are just cueing in.  Wondering why our main character Wol is on the ground in a puddle of his own blood.  Our White Mage, Rei, hovering over him, trying every Phoenix Down she could find.  Our Thief, Axel, keeping watch for any monsters that want to take a potshot at our healer.  

And that leave just me, the Black Mage, throwing out entry level spells to keep the monsters away.

*Again...fuck my life.*

So let's get a little bit of backstory.  I'm an author that writes Final Fantasy fanfictions.  Most of them I was too afraid to post.  Now, I have somehow been thrown into this world with no idea how to get out or if I would ever survive.  All I know was that I knew how to cast Stone, Wind, and Blizzard and that was it.  I thought I would stand a chance if I would find Wol and party up with him.

Problem is...EVERYONE is named Wol.

I traveled from the plains and into the desert just to find the one person that had a Moogle following him.  I nearly died FIVE times, went on and followed three other people who just so happened to have a Moogle with them, and nearly took a blade to my chest for stalking two others. Sure enough, right outside a temple near the edge of the desert, there he was.  About to walk it.

And two other people followed.  Great, I'm not the only one who had the idea to flock to the main character.

I somehow managed to join them inside the dungeon and helped clear it out.  Everything went great, we cleared mobs, stayed healthy thanks to Rei, earned quite a bit of gil thanks to Axel stealing money left and right.  And my entry level spells were more than enough to stagger the enemy.

We got to the bottom floor where the Lich waited for us.  We fought him twice before but this time he got the upper hand on us.  

God damnit Wol, why did you switch to Onion Knight for this area.  You knew that was a bad idea, now I have no idea where to go from here....",DoctorJehuty,

My numb hands search clumsily for a light switch, feeling the bumps and tears of rotting wallpaper through the hole on the tip of the glove's ring finger. I hesitantly put my left boot forward and down until I heard the crunch of glass and feel my foot squeeze the cold water out of my many layers of socks. 

THIS ASSHOLE COULD HAVE AT LEAST THOUGHT UP A WARM SETTING, I think to myself. AND SOME OPEN CURTAINS WOULDN'T HURT EITHER. I slowly rub my hands across the wall and it seems to bend slightly as I put my weight on it. Finally I feel the familiar plastic of a light switch and I throw up my finger, squinting my eyes in preparation for the coming light. The light which did appear was disappointing in its glow, hardly illuminating the corners of the large living room. 

As I turn to study my surroundings, a glare burns into my passing eyes. I spin back around to see myself in a tall standing mirror with the light shining just behind me. When I shuffle over to block the glare in the long mirror, I realize that I look more disheveled than the room itself. The overturned sofa, books torn open, shattered television screen, and thousands of glass shards littered across the floor seemed to hold only a glimmer in comparison to my soaked, torn, and blood caked parka. I ALMOST BLEND IN HERE, I think as I watch a frightened smile stretches my lips across my pale and blotchy face. IT COULDN'T BE TOO HARD TO HIDE IF I WAS FOLLOWED HERE. 

My mind was quickly snatched back into reality after remembering Peter's last words to me. ""2134 West Thames Street. Go there and hide, you'll be safe. I will come find you as soon as I can."" I still don't understand what he was running from, but I can't seem to wrap my head around anything going on. I thought for sure all of this centered around him. How could it not have? He kept appearing everywhere I went. Some kind of writhing compulsion to trust him had led me everywhere up to that point. I looked again to the mirror. The shock hasn't left my face, and seeing his dark frozen blood spattered across it surely won't help. I turn away from the mirror and slowly fall to my knees, feelings the tiny pieces of glass poking into my jeans.

I SHOULD HAVE JUST COME HERE WHEN HE TOLD ME TO, I whisper to myself. NO ONE WOULD HAVE SEEN ME, AND I WOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO SEE THAT. I had never seen someone die before, in this world or the one I knew before. 

As soon as Peter gave his final advice, he turned down the street ran around the corner, disappearing from view. After a short moment of contemplation I decided to follow him. He was fast and had built up a lead of about half a block. Too far to call out to in the  black and grey swirl of that early morning blizzard. I could hardly see him through all of the snow that seemed to float throughout the city. It was as if Brooklyn had been caught in a winter dust bowl.",Yanawa7,

Fools and glorified clowns with superpowers and a tiara, I realised that while the world was largely normal, in this world you were either a Magical Soldier, or a bystander.

And I had no intent on being a bystander.

Not after Kyoto vanished in a Dark Empire attack.

The grim spectre of death hangs above our world, and these magical girls are our only defence. Randomly selected from the populace, they gain the memories of ancient celestial beings who held back entropy. Living avatars for deific power. Creation versus destruction. Energy versus an absence of energy.

I had positioned myself to be the teacher for the girl who was clearly Pretty Neko Soldier Purple. As a new maths teacher, she would never suspect I had been monitoring her.

I watched her transform, from a hiding spot in an alley.

I knew what I wanted. That sceptre. Each Majou Shoujo has one. A focus from which they attune themselves to their protodeity's power.

The transformation sequence was long, but I had a cricket bat and determination.

I hit her across the head, knocking her to the ground. The sceptre rolled to my feet.

This was a world of fiction. I knew this. 

It was obviously false and wrong.

I held a sceptre in one hand, a cricket bat in the other.

These people were weak. No writing could defend their actions.

Child soldiers...

No more. I did the meditative exercise the WikiHow to be a Magical Girl article suggested.

Golden armour traced itself around my limbs, conjured from some energy plane. Gauntlets had claws. An emblem of a predatory cat blazed across my chest. Black cloth and gold contrasted.

The girl was standing by now.

**Pledge to me your loyalty, Akagi, and you will know my mercy. This world needs a hero, not an pop star idol.**

She shrieked with rage, and lunged at the sceptre.

The power within was manipulative, and seductive. It tried to disintegrate her, but I punted her with my foot into a building.

As with everything humanity engineers, even this idealistic proposition was corrupted.

""You may enter,"" you utter for what feels like the thousandth time. A dozen bodies shuffle into the cold, barren room. A desk for each and bright, almost blinding lights above the only notable interests in its entirety. 

You see fear on their faces, and rightfully so. These brave souls before you, those that believe they have what it takes to receive what would be considered an easy pass through life. Slowly they sit, attempting to maintain brave faces among their peers. Little do they know it is their own minds they have to fear. 

""Instructions can be found on the first sheet."" The words exit your mouth with barely a thought, this being one of a dozen times you've repeated them within the past week. ""If you speak, you will be withdrawn. If you attempt to view your peers' papers, you will be withdrawn. Should you have a question or need anything, it had better be important to the point of life or death, or you will be withdrawn. You have 30 minutes.""

Immediately you see a dozen minds churning. A dozen pencils scratching at paper, the culmination of everything these lives before you can put to words. Detailing and explaining why they deserve a life of luxury, a life of encouragement. Answering the philosophical and political questions placed before them. Those that cannot properly express such will be failed, and they will spend their remaining time in servitude.

After what feels like hours the candidates are finished, the timer rings out across the room. Papers are shuffled forward and dropped on your desk as the young minds before you, most only in their early 20's, await their fate. 

You place the papers into the reader located on your desk, scanning their words and ruling its own judgment. This, though not the greatest deception of the process, feels as much a lie as anything else. You are not a judge, nor a true teacher. You are a figurehead, a mouth to read the words you are told by this computer.

I didn't much like the look on my face. We were sitting in the small cafe just next to university, and when the waitress moved out of our way - leaving our English breakfast on the table - Jane was sitting right there, as impossibly perfect as always. 

""I don't know,"" my younger self said. God, what a fucking twat I was at twenty one. He was just sitting there, acne still pronounced, a lock of dumb hair in the way of his left eye, mouth slightly ajar. 
""What don't you know? Go get her, man.""
""I've never talked to her really.""
""So go ahead!""

The rising note at the end betrayed my impatience. Me-at-twenty-one had been through some shit, to be fair. It had only been four months in this timeline, I recalled, since his (our?) first relationship came to an undesired end. I had blacked out much of the fallout from my memory, the days spent in bed, eating junk food, not seeing anyone. 

Still didn't excuse this sad sap disrupting my plans. 

""We've gone over this,"" I said now. ""It's the timing, alright? You can seduce her in six weeks at the party and have a baby girl, or you can seduce her today and have a boy. But we need that boy, so it's gonna have to be today."" 
""What if she laughs in my face?""
""Bullshit. You'll be fine, I promise.""
""Promise?""
""Trust me, I was there.""

I really didn't like the look on his face now. Bits and pieces of memories were coming back to me again. The time I was bi, which overlapped with both Roberta and Jane. That time I almost grabbed a guy's crotch while wasted, but didn't. I never acted on it, of course. Not in the timeline I remembered. 

Now my younger self was looking at me with an expression I recognised, in the bathroom mirror when I discovered lingerie catalogues at the tender age of twelve. I sighed into the reflection in the window - thirty seven, muscular, handsome, rippling forearms in a rolled up shirt. A good change from my youth. 

Jane was looking at me too, having just noticed her admirers.Through the window, with those big blue doe eyes and the bottom lip biting I knew too well. 

I knew then what I had to do, son, for the good of mankind. The fate of the universe rested on your being born a boy. That's how I had a threesome with myself and your mother. ",Enoughandthemoon,

And I remember back to the worst day of my life. I was young, at school and the teacher asked me a question. That question. The question that ruined my life.

I didn't know the answer. The class laughed at me. I cried.

That night I saw a shooting star.

I could of wished for anything. To be rich, to find true love. So many things I could have wished for that would mean I was happy today.

But I wasted my wish, because I wished to know the answer to the question.

And every day for 15 years I have woken up at the same time.

And trust me, after 15 years of that you definitely know, you never forget.

"[WP] He opened the fortune cookie he found in his front jacket pocket; in it, a toe tag with his name on it and a date: tomorrow.",pshew,"I peered at the bustling coffee shop behind dark sunglasses. I took a seat at an empty table outside and massaged my temples trying to brush away a headache. A young waitress walked by and I signaled silently for a black coffee. She smiled knowingly at me and left to put in my order. I leaned back against my jacket and tried to remember what happened the night before.


All I had was vague recollections: of course, it started with a bottle of whiskey, then some nightclub with flashing strobe lights, and ah shit! Sarah was there. That explained everything; normally I do not hit the bottle so hard, but a crazy ex-girlfriend sometimes requires some liquid medication. I sighed in relief, leaned back further in my chair, and heard the rustling of plastic in my jacket pocket. I pulled out a fortune cookie and the remembrance of late night Chinese food hit me and instantly my stomach turned queasy as the waitress returned with my coffee. She saw the pained look on my face and gestured towards the bathroom in the back of the café. 


I took a slow sip of coffee and waited for the wave of nausea to pass. I thought of Sarah some more; I remembered her strawberry hair and crooked smile. How she used to look at me slightly biting down on her lips. That bitch. I was in love while she slept her way through the line cooks at her restaurant. Goddamn, I started to think that liquid medication was necessary again for my future. I took the last sip of coffee, looked down at the fortune cookie on the table, and absentmindedly opened it. I cracked the cookie in half and pulled out a small slip of paper: it had a hollow ring with a string attached to it and the date and time of Tuesday, September 6, 2016, 1:20 a.m. huh, tomorrow, weird, I thought as I threw away the fortune and my empty coffee cup.


                                                     …


The rest of the day, to my great shame, I spent looking at Facebook posts and Instagram pictures of Sarah. She was doing great; she had a new job, boyfriend, looked well—all of the bullshit that you thought would be impossible without you. As I sank further and further into that well of painful memories, I knew I would be going out again tonight. When the phone rang later in the evening, I was already half deep into a bottle of whiskey, and welcomed my friend’s plan to party.


He picked me up and with the brazen confidence of alcohol, I straddled in a nightclub determined to find a girl to get my mind off Sarah. I spent the next couple of hours jumping high in the air and swaying off beat to loud music.  I danced awkwardly with some girls, but nothing took off.  At around one in the morning, my buddy suggested takeout. I enthusiastically agreed (forgetting the regrets of the night before) and drunkenly stumbled out of the nightclub. I started to cross an intersection when I heard the squealing of brakes and barking of a car horn, I felt a whoosh hit my body, and then I heard no more.

It's hard being so close to a girl that will never love you. Who has your heart, but you'll never have hers. That's Rebecca, the fifteen year old blonde haired goddess next door. She lives with her parents in the huge yellow house that's far too big for the three of them. I reckon they planned on having more children but something went wrong. It's for the best anyway, her parents are tools. I think they beat her -- I've seen bruises on her legs before! One day i'm going to set her free.

I'm a decent looking guy. I'm a nice guy. She *should* like me. I'm smart too -- loads going for me. Her parents must have turned her against me at some point, 'cause they knew I'd change her. Make her see them for what they really are.

She's gone to bed early tonight. Think I'll turn in. Arms are tired from holding the binoculars anyway.

20:05     

She's not back yet. I couldn't have missed her, I haven't left the window all evening. Nope, couldn't have missed her. My piss bottle's almost full and starting to stink. Hope she gets home soon.

20:52

Fucking nine o'clock... and there's someone with her. Holy shit, Mike. As if I don't get enough problems at school from the asshole, now he's trying to take my girl. No fucking way. If they kiss...


Friday
-------

I will have her heart. It belongs to me not Mike.


Saturday
-------

Her parents are out tomorrow night with mine. It's my chance to make a grand gesture. I can win her over.



Sunday
-------

FUCK FUCK FUCK. She made me do it. SHE MADE ME.

Well, she'll always be the girl next door now. The girl that never ages. The girl that lies under 4 foot of dirt. I finally have her heart. I wish it felt more satisfying.

Yoda sensed a great disturbance in the force as if millions of clones suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.

It didn't happen at once, information takes time to travel. It started closest to Coruscant and spread from there. Some of the stronger Jedi could feel it before it happened, a disturbance in the force, a ripple in the binding power of the universe. Every clone trooper, at every station and every post received Order 65. This was the moment they had been training for, a plan years in the making. To a man each one dropped their gun and began the ritual. Their cries echoed around their surroundings, striking fear into all who heard it.

""Execute Order 65.""

A small popup appeared on JB-032001's HUD.

&gt; Order 65: In the event of either (i) a majority in the Senate declaring the Supreme Commander (Chancellor) to be unfit to issue orders, or (ii) the Security Council declaring him to be unfit to issue orders, and an authenticated order being received by the GAR, commanders shall be authorized to detain the Supreme Commander, with lethal force if necessary, and command of the GAR shall fall to the acting Chancellor until a successor is appointed or alternative authority identified as outlined in Section 6 (iv).

Messages came in from across the holonet of the Supreme Chancellor's decision.

His own guard shot him down in seconds.

JB-032001, for the first time since he was created, smiled, which unnerved the Twilek Jedi he was stationed with.

""What's up, Jace?"" she asked.

""The Chancellor finally came to his sensed. He ordered his own execution, presumably out of fear he has been corrupted.""

The Twilek nodded gravely.

""Everyone suspected. I mean, he wears black all the time and his name literally means 'stabby Emperor'. If he had the Force, he'd be a Sith for sure.""

JB-032001 noticed on his hud that clankers were coming in.

His Twilek best friend forever had already ignited her lightsaber.
